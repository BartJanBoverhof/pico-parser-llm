from Bio import Entrez, Medline  # Importing necessary modules for PubMed access and parsing.

"""
This script interacts with the PubMed database to retrieve and process scientific articles based on a specified search query. 
It uses the Biopython library to perform the search, fetch detailed article information in MEDLINE format, 
and extract key details such as the title, abstract, DOI, and authors. The results are stored in a dictionary for further analysis.
