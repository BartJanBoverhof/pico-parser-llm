# ============================
# RAG Pipeline Configuration v1.2
# ============================
# Goals:
# - Generic, minimally-steering retrieval & prompting
# - Only external runtime input: {indication}
# - Intervention is NOT taken from documents; always "Medicine X (under assessment)"
# - Support extraction of populations and sub-populations (exactly as stated)
# - Clean separation of generic prompting from case adapters
