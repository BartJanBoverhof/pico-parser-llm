FIGURE 4.1: TRIAL PROFILE [1] A non-inferiority test of overall survival (OS) between lenvatinib and sorafenib was done using a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of hazard ratio (HR) (lenvatinib:sorafenib). The HR and the corresponding 2sided 95% CI were estimated using a Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group as a factor, and stratified by the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors. Superiority hypotheses were tested for OS using a stratified log-rank test with the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors. No multiplicity adjustments were needed for testing of the non-inferiority and superiority of OS due to the closed testing principle. Two interim analyses were performed. Since the study was not stopped at the first or second interim analysis, non-inferiority for OS was tested first at the final analysis with a non-inferiority margin of 1.08, which indicated that lenvatinib preserved at least 60% (corresponding to δ = 0.60) of the sorafenib treatment effect versus placebo as observed in the sorafenib SHARP and Asia-Pacific trials [5,6]. Non-inferiority was declared if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for HR was <1.08 at the final analysis.",

The stages are divided by tumor stage, liver function status, physical status and cancer-related symptoms. Overall, HCC patients are categorized into those with early HCC who benefit from curative therapy, those with intermediate and advanced disease who have benefited from palliative treatments, and finally patients who have terminal disease who are offered symptomatic treatment.[3] Patients with early disease (BCLCC A) are evaluated for surgical removal of the tumor, liver transplantation or percutaneous ablation (destruction of cancer cells by means of subtle chemotherapy or hyper-hypothermia, where in particular radiofrequency (RFA) therapy has been introduced in Denmark) with the possibility of five-year recovery, and have a high incidence of hepatohepatitis over five years, and do not have symptoms and are still dependent on interstitial treatment.[3] About 50-75 percent of the patients with BCC who respond to this treatment have no symptoms or no symptoms are still undergoing treatment with liver cancer (BBCLC A, BCLC A) or in childhood cancer.[3]",

It noted from the clinical studies that life expectancy without sorafenib was unlikely to be greater than 24 months and was potentially as low as 7.9 months, although the latter was based on SHARP, which was stopped early. The committee considered that evidence from the clinical studies of sorafenib plus best supportive care suggested that it increased median survival by more than 2.8 months compared with placebo plus best supportive care, and the company's economic model predicted a mean gain in overall survival of 6.1 months, although this depended on the method of extrapolation.

According to the latest available data, globally, HCC ranks seventh in incidence and fourth in direct mortality from cancer (1). The incidence of HCC increases with age (exceptionally it occurs before 40 years and the median age at diagnosis in our midst is between 65-70 years), being more frequent in men than in women (2). The rate of incidence is higher in western and south-eastern Africa, where the main etiological factors are hepatitis B and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection.",

Unlike other solid tumors, for which the therapeutic decision is made based on the TNM classification, there is no consensus prognostic classification for HCC7. Therefore, several classifications or scores have been proposed including the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 8 classification which has the advantage of enabling a prognosis stratification and proposing a treatment algorithm. When HCC is at an early stage (BC 0-A), patients are generally eligible for curative treatment by surgery, radiosurgery or transplantation. In case of failure, refractory disease or ineligibility for TACE, or in the presence of vascular invasion and/ or extrahepatic injury (advanced stage CLC), treatment with sorafenib is recommended in patients with preserved general condition (ECOG ≤ 2) and preserved hepatic function (Child-Pugh A). In adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (stage BCLC B or C) who have not received prior systemic therapy, the medical need is therefore considered to be partially met by sorafenib.

Hazard ratios and CI were estimated using a stratified Cox model. If the upper bound of the LIC was less than the non-inferiority bound equal to 1.08, then non-inferriority of lenvatinib vs sorafenib could be claimed at the bilateral alpha risk of 0.05 and the superiority of the MHSR 9/25 could then be tested at the same threshold.

The 1st amendment (6 January 2014) mainly consisted of additions and clarifications regarding certain selection criteria (pre-cancer treatment, concomitant treatment, etc.), the addition of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire as a secondary quality of life assessment criterion (with updated statistical analysis), and the modification of the follow-up time for overall survival (life expectancy 2 to 3 months). The following two amendments consisted in amendments and clarification regarding the events that were expected to occur in the analyses.

As these may mainly involve fatigue, bleeding and abdominal pain, most of the patients studied had a Child-Pugh stage liver failure, there are limited data on safety and tolerability in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Experience According to the Periodic Safety Update Report for the first half of 2007, 19,086 patients were treated during that period (8740 commercially and 10,346 in clinical trials). 1The term \" adverse reactions\" refers to complaints and symptoms regardless of cause. Clinical pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely with concomitant use of agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 (midazolam, dextromethorphan, omeprazole). It cannot be excluded that sorafenib increases the concentrations of co-administered P-gp substrates (such as digoxin), CYP2B6 (like bupropion, cyclophosphamide, efavirenz, metronidazole), CYP8C2 (like paclitaxel, amodiaquine, repaglinide), or CYP2C9 (like acetoacetylsalicylate).

Hepatocellular carcinoma is newly diagnosed in an estimated 560,000 people per year, worldwide.1 In the Netherlands, a total of 1964 patients with hepatocellulose cancer were registered in the period 1989-2000 (1964/12 = 164/year).2 The male-female ratio was 2.4:1. In 2000, the standardized incidence was 1.6/100,000 men and 0.3/100,000 women. There was no increase over time. Risk factors in Europe are: hepatitis C (60-70%), alcohol consumption (20%), hepatitis B (10-15%) and other (10%). In a European study covering 1990-1994, the 5-year survival rate for the Netherlands was 7% and the 1-year survivorship rate was 22%.2 Stage classification. Several factors are important for the prognosis and thus for the indication for treatment, including tumour size, degree of tumour spread, liver function (Child-Pugh stage), the general physical condition of the patient (performance status; PS), and symptoms associated with cancer.",

Conclusion From the limited literature available, it appears that patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma had a statistically significantly longer survival when taking sorafenib than when taking placebo. b. interactions 4.1 During treatment of patients with hepatocelluloma in phase III trials with sorafenic acid, the only serious adverse reactions occurred in 52% of patients (p = 54%; p = 0.49% for those who received placebo). The frequency of serious (grade 3/ 4) adverse reactions occurring at least 2% more frequently in the sorafenib group than in the placebo group were: hypertension (4 vs 1%), diarrhoea (11 vs 2%), lymphoedema (3 vs 0%), abdominal pain (9 vs 6%), hand feeding reactions (8 vs 1%).

The estimated expenditure related to the new therapy (the “tomorrow” scenario) is compared with how much currently is spent on the treatment of a particular health problem (the “today” scenario).

The Committee emphasises that the number of events in this outcome was sufficient to draw conclusions from the study. The REFLECT study demonstrated superiority of lenvatinib compared to sorafenib in the outcomes of progression-free survival (median 7.4 versus 3.7 months, respectively, with a HR of 0.66 and a 95% CI of 0.57 to 0.77, p< 0.001) and response rate (24.1% versus 9.2%), OR 3.13 (95% CI 2.15 to 4.56, p < 0.001), however these results are not critical for this evaluation.

I published the study from IM150 in which atezozizumab+ bevaxizumab was compared to bevajizumab as a treatment for HCC and no difference in efficacy was observed in patients with atherosclerosis (≥ 95%) in the subgroup of 1,05 to 1,68 patients with HCC plus sorafenil (≥ KIHRK1,63) [5].

TLV assumed that 40 percent of patients receive follow-up treatment. After treatment with Stride, half of the patients are assumed to receive soraphenib and half of those patients are considered to be receiving sorafenima. Patients treated with first-line Lenven or Lenven are equally divided between Stivarga (regorafenib) and Cabometyx (kabozantinib). TLV presents sensitivity analyses with other assumptions about follow-on treatments. The Company reports a cost comparison between STRIDE and Tecentriq plus bevacizumab. The Company' s cost comparisons include drug and drug administration costs. Based on the indirect comparison reported by the Company (see section 2.4.2), it is assumed that treatment with Tecentrq + bevazizumab would result in a longer progression-free survival compared to STRIDES. Therefore, drug and medication administration costs are calculated according to the PFS curves for the respective treatments.",

The TLV clinical expert considers that the study design, where a second course of STRIDE was possible for some patients, could be a treatment option for isolated patients in Sweden. In Sweden, patients are treated first-line with sorafenib or lenvatinib if atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is not appropriate. However, according to the TLV Clinical Expert, an equivalent efficacy of sorefenib/lenvatinib is expected irrespective of patients' suitability for atezoizumab + bevaziumab. EMA considers that the adverse reactions of STRIDE are significant, but that relatively few patients discontinue treatment and that most of the side effects are clinically manageable. EMA is of the opinion that the side effect profile of ST RIDE is not significantly worse than that of sorafenib.[2] TLV's clinical expert considers STRITE's side effects were expected and that they do not differ significantly from other studies with combined immunotherapy.

Regarding PFS, TLV considers that it is reasonable to assume that the efficacy of Lenvima is better than that of sorafenib. Therefore, in TLV's analysis, the PFS curve for Lenvema is extrapolated by applying a constant hazard quotient of 0,66 (from the RE-FLECT study [10]) to the extrapolled curve of sorabenib. Even with the aforementioned adjustments of OS and PFS for lenvima, the TLV assesses that there are uncertainties with the extrapolation as the data is based on the REFLECT TLV study. However, TL V considers the adjustments made make OS and pFS more consistent with the opinion of the FLECT study, the national healthcare and TLV programme experts on the effectiveness of LENVIMA in relation to the effect of soravenib.

At 8 years, the risk of death is assumed to be the same in both treatment arms (HR=1). At these time points, only a small proportion of patients are still progression-free and on treatment according to extrapolated PFS and TTD curves (TTD, Time on Treatment). Approximately 97 percent have progressed by 6 years and approximately 2 percent are on treatment with STRIDA.
