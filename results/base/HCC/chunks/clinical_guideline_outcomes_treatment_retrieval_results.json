Retrospective analyses have shown that TACE outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival can be improved by further differentiating the indication within the criteria of BC BLC stage. In particular, the size and number of tumour cores and the severity of the dysfunction are of minor importance. The vascularisation of the tumour core plays an important role in the outcome of TACE. Pseudoencapsulation suggests better outcomes than in poorly vascularized and diffuse arterially supplied tumours. Tumor sites at the 'water gap' between arterial supply territories also present increased demands on the interventional treatment technique. This involves high quality intraprocedural imaging, possibly including cone beam CT under arterial perfusion to clarify selective vascularisation. The greater the selectivity of transarterial therapy and the more pronounced and comprehensive the devascularizing effect of the embolization measures, the better the efficacy of TACE and the lesser the side-effect.",

Of course, the limited availability of donor organs also plays an important role. The available analyses are mainly based on morphometric criteria, i.e. the number and size of tumour nodes. In the case of purely hepatic infection, the risk of recurrence after liver transplantation is correlated with the number (maximum or cumulative) size of existing tumours [151]. The so-called Milan criteria are used as the standard established criterion for the indication for liver transplant in most countries, as well as in Germany [152]. Patients with an unstable HCC within the Milan criteria have a 5-year survival rate of 65 - 80% and an HCCR rate of approximately 10-12% after liver transplants, [153] Therefore, the Milan criterion accepted in Germany also represents a high priority for planning liver transplantations every 3 months.

Retrospective analyses have shown that TACE outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival can be improved by further differentiating the indication within the criteria of BC BLC stage. In particular, the size and number of tumour cores and the severity of the dysfunction are of minor importance. The vascularisation of the tumour core plays an important role in the outcome of TACE. Pseudoencapsulation suggests better outcomes than in poorly vascularized and diffuse arterially supplied tumours. Tumor sites at the 'water gap' between arterial supply territories also present increased demands on the interventional treatment technique. This involves high quality intraprocedural imaging, possibly including cone beam CT under arterial perfusion to clarify selective vascularisation. The greater the selectivity of transarterial therapy and the more pronounced and comprehensive the devascularizing effect of the embolization measures, the better the efficacy of TACE and the lesser the side-effect.",

Of course, the limited availability of donor organs also plays an important role. The available analyses are mainly based on morphometric criteria, i.e. the number and size of tumour nodes. In the case of purely hepatic infection, the risk of recurrence after liver transplantation is correlated with the number (maximum or cumulative) size of existing tumours [151]. The so-called Milan criteria are used as the standard established criterion for the indication for liver transplant in most countries, as well as in Germany [152]. Patients with an unstable HCC within the Milan criteria have a 5-year survival rate of 65 - 80% and an HCCR rate of approximately 10-12% after liver transplants, [153] Therefore, the Milan criterion accepted in Germany also represents a high priority for planning liver transplantations every 3 months.

Other recent key references (72, 73). Liver transplantation should be reserved for patients with 5-year survival comparable to that of non-HCC patients, i.e. approximately 70%. Prognosis is assessed primarily on the basis of the diameter of the largest tumour and the number of tumours in the liver. There must be no extrahepatic tumour. Microinvasion is a very poor prognostic sign and there is some correlation to tumour size and number as well as certain biomarkers; however, there are no reliable, either radiological or biomarker methods to detect microinvision, which is why microbial invasion is not yet included in the selection of liver transplants. However, if one could use multiple criteria to validate the prognosis of patients with micro-transplantation, we will be able to use a better prognosis for those patients with non-AFPs (see below).",

This is a fine distinction that is not always possible to make. An additional concern about fine needle biopsy is the risk of bleeding and seeding. Most studies that demonstrate seeding after needle biopsy do not specify the size of the lesion that was biopsied (42, 43). Morphological characteristics can help in the separation of HGDN from HCC, but the addition of special dyes and immunohistochemical dyes is advised. Special staining for reticulin, whereby loss or alteration of reticulation is seen in HCC markers (44) is known. Additionally, by applying a panel of immune histological markers of Glycoprotein 703, Glutamicin 703, and Vitamins 70 can assist in the differentiation of tumors (such as heat shock) from the tumor (diffusion).

Recommendations are graded in 3 categories according to the level of evidence of data found in the literature.Results: The diagnosis and staging of HCC is essentially based on clinical, biological and imaging features. A pathological analysis obtained by a biopsy of tumoral and non-tumoral liver is rec- ommended. HCCs can be divided into 2 groups, taking into account not only the tumor stage, but also liver function. HCCs accessible to curative treatments are tumors that are in Milan criteria or with an AFP score ≤ 2, mainly treated by surgical resection, local ablation or liver transplantation. Intermediate and advanced HCCs with no liver insufﬁciency, accessible only to palliative treatments, beneﬁt from TACE, SIRT or systemic therapy according to the presence or absence of macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. Conclusion: Such recommendations are in permanent optimization and each individual case must be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert board.",

The presence of homolateral tumor-related portal vein exten- sion may be discussed in an expert center for resection when the contralateral main trunk is free from disease [32]. How- ever , French cohorts showed that surgery does not provide OS beneﬁt compared to sorafenib in this setting [33]. Ideally, resection of HCC should consist in an anatomical resection with margins of 2 cm [34,35] .In the absence of advanced liver ﬁbrosis, resection is the gold standard and the possibilities are greater than in cirrhotic patients, even for large tumors [36].Local ablationPercutaneous ablation is an alternative to surgery, usually well tolerated, without signiﬁcant amputation of non- tumoral parenchyma. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation are the most performed techniques and are possible if the tumor is accessible to puncture guided by US or CT and located away from the hilum and large bile ducts. Biliodigestive anastomosis or signiﬁcant ascites are contraindications to local ablation.Local ablation represents an effective alternative to surgery for small HCCs under certain conditions. To date, 6 randomized studies [37—42] and 6 retrospective studies [43—48] with propensity score analysis compared surgery with RFA. Most of these studies have limited statistical power because of the small number of patients. Among the ran-",

Several observational studies, including some Italian ones, have given results consistent with the Asian data, confirming that half-yearly surveillance4 (level of evidence 2++) is effective in cirrhotic patients (considered at risk for annual incidence of HCC at around 2-45.6%) (Class of Evidence 2++). Advanced age (over 70-75) is not in itself a reason not to recommend periodic monitoring, as it does not preclude subsequent treatment8 (Level of Evidence 2+). The addition of periodic alpha-fetoprotein dosing to ultrasound surveillance does not substantially increase (approximately 6%) the rate of recognition of HCC at an early stage and significantly worsens the cost-effectiveness of surveillance, increasing the number of false positives (Leval of Evidences 2+) However, monitoring of the semihyperfetoma may not reduce the patient's risk of hypersensitivity to monitoring, except in the absence of available instruments. However, it remains an indicator of the risk of developing HCC and should be dosed at the time of detection of a focal liver lesion on cirrhosis to contribute to the diagnostic and prognostic framework.",

The use of chemotherapeutic agents in HCC patients, characterised by a high rate of marked impairment of more or less potent hepatic function, results in increased carcinogenicity associated with elevated risk of cancer, in addition to the intrinsically low toxicity of HCC-related carcinogens. In addition, HCC can be listed among cancers intrinsically characterized by less chemo-sensitivity. Numerous chemotherapeutic drugs, as single agents or in combination, have been experimented over the past decades in patients with HCC, producing more or less disappointing percentages of objective responses, without ever producing a solid demonstration of efficacy. Among the various cytotoxic drugs experimented and variously used in clinical practice, doxorubicin, used as a single agent, is reported.",

Recommendation Inform patients and family/neighbours about the possible emergence of complaints after treatment of HCC. Report these early consequences of cancer using a (validated) screening tool. This screening should be used from diagnosis to treatment and follow-up. Considerations Disease and treatment have major consequences The Health Council concludes that many patients, after intentional curative treatment for cancer, suffer from complaints (Health Council, 2007). These complaints may be limited or extensive, both physical and psychological in nature, and may occur early or later. This is called distress. By distress is meant: an unpleasant emotional experience of a psychological (cognitive, behavioural, emotional), social and/or spiritual nature that may interfere with the ability to effectively cope with cancer, the accompanying physical symptoms and treatment (Guideline on detecting the need for psychosocial care, 2017). These are mostly physical consequences that are clearly linked to the specific nature of the cancer, consequences of the treatment, psychsocial problems and general complaints.

Consideration must be given to liver function, general condition, complicating diseases, expected survival and patient compliance. Monitoring should be discontinued if active treatment can no longer be given due to changed conditions. Therefore, the pre-conditions should be assessed regularly by the physician, and HCH monitoring should not be performed in: • Child-Pugh class C, because active tumour therapy cannot be offered. Exceptions are Child-Cugh topical patients for transplantation, where a newly detected HCC on the liver may interfere with the transplantation indication [105, 106]. • Short-term illness that prevents active HCC from being expected to result in treatment. • Lack of survival.",

Radiological methods are important for early documentation of objective signs of treatment response that correlate with survival. A disadvantage of the standard method RECIST in HCC is that there are effective treatments, such as some locoregional modalities and targeted drugs, that do not affect the size of tumors and where the clinical effect of treatment is therefore not captured [175]. The problem of the absence of tumor shrinkage was addressed with the introduction of the concept of viabletumor in the modified RECISTM criteria (mRECIST) [176]. Tumor viability is defined radiologically as the remaining contrast-suppressing area in the tumor I. Instead of measuring the maximum length of the tumor according to the MRCIST 1.1 method, the maximum diameter of the longest diametrical remaining area (MRCIST) or the maximum time remaining in the intermediate stage (TACRISTM) in the region after complete non-absorption or contraception of the HCC (T) is measured by TACRIST 1. However, several studies have shown that response (=ORR, overall response rate) after locoregional treatment as measured by mRECIST predicts survival (OS) [177].",
