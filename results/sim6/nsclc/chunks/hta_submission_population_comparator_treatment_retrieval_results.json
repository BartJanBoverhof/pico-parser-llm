Nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab each lead to a significant prolongation in overall survival compared with docetaxel and also to a significant reduction in side\neffects. Accordingly, the guidelines regularly prefer immune checkpoint inhibitors over\ncytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. However, PD-L1 negative tumours are a\nfundamental exception. In these cases, the guidelines predominantly do not\nrecommend a regular preference of immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, in PD-L1 negative tumours, alternative cytotoxic\nchemotherapeutic agents are also determined as an appropriate comparator therapy for the immune checkpoint inhibitors. For ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel, no additional benefit was shown in the benefit assessment compared to docetaxel (resolution of 1 September 2016). Likewise, no additional benefit was identified in the benefit assessment of afatinib compared to docetaxel (resolution of 20 October 2016). Taking into account that\nbenefit-assessed medicinal treatments with an additional benefit are available in the present indication, the treatment options ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel\nas well as afatinib, for which no additional benefit could be determined in each case, are not considered as an appropriate comparator therapy. In the overall assessment, the G-BA determined docetaxel, pemetrexed, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab and docetaxel in combination with nintedanib as equally\nappropriate comparator therapies for this patient group. The additional benefit can be\ndemonstrated compared to one of the treatment options mentioned.",

It should be noted that there is no higher quality evidence for the treatment of NSCLC related to the KRAS p.G12C mutation. So far, there are no other approved medicinal treatments besides sotorasib that are explicitly used in the presence of a KRAS p.G12C mutation according to the marketing authorisation.

Summary **Source Type:** hta_submission\n\nThis single technology assessment investigates the clinical value of sotorasib (Lumykras™) compared to the relevant current treatment used in Denmark for adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\nwith KRAS G12C mutation who have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. There are several approved treatments targeting specific driver mutations in NSCLC that have improved patient survival significantly compared with non-targeted treatments for patients with an actionable mutation(1). However, currently, no approved treatment is available that specifically targets the KRAS G12C driver mutation in NSCLC. Standard of care treatment for KRAS G12C mutated NSCLC is currently the same as for patients with nontargetable mutations. This includes PD-(L)1 inhibitors (with or without platinum chemotherapy) for first-line (1L)\ntreatment of advanced NSCLC. Nearly all patients progress on these treatments and receive limited benefit from\nSOC cytotoxic chemotherapy treatments in subsequent lines of therapy. Most patients experience a decline in\nperformance status during 1L therapy that limits their tolerance for and the effect of second line and beyond\n(2L+) chemotherapy. Therefore, this patient group (KRAS G12C NSCLC) has a particularly high unmet need for\neffective and tolerable therapies, that can improve survival outcomes without compromising health-related quality of life (HRQoL) including toxicity.",

Given that CodeBreak 100 included 57% of patients with 2 or more\nprior lines of therapy, a comparison of PFS and OS data from the whole of the CodeBreak 100 NSCLC population against PFS and OS data from patients in SELECT-1, who had received only one prior line of\ntherapy, is likely to be conservative.

Based on a register study in the capital region, the KRAS G12C mutation occurred in X of non-squamous NSCLC patients (Data on file(5)). This equates to 292 KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC cases in Denmark in 2020. The\nestimated incidence of the KRAS G12C mutation is similar to the incidence suggested by two Danish clinical experts within NSCLC(2, 3). The two clinical experts suggested an annual incidence of 250-300 KRAS G12C\nmutations eligible for 1L treatment. Based on clinical validation, approximately 50% of the patients reach 2L\ntreatment each year. This equates to approximately 140 potential incident patients per year in Denmark. Furthermore, it was reported in the DLCR report that up to 26% of patients that started 1L treatment in 2020 was treated with curatively intended treatment this reduces the estimate to approximately 110 patients per\nyear in Denmark (4). To accommodate annual variation and uncertainty around the estimate, a range of 110-\n140 eligible patients is assumed for 2L treatment with sotorasib in Denmark every year (see Table 4). Table 4.

Outcomes data for patients specifically with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC are limited. The systematic literature\nreviews described in Appendix A sought to identify clinical trials of therapies conducted in patients with KRASmutant NSCLC, and identified only one RCT (SELECT-1) that provided sufficient PFS and OS data for docetaxel monotherapy (the primary comparator) in a population of patients with KRAS-mutated NSCLC (including G12C\nand non-G12C mutations) (127). Several published observational studies in Western (European, Australian and US) populations show that survival in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC is similarly poor as that in patients with other KRAS mutations or\nwild type disease who are not eligible for existing targeted therapies (72, 128, 129). The SELECT-1 trial itself\nshowed that survival outcomes were highly consistent for those with KRAS G12C-mutated and those with other\nKRAS-mutated NSCLC (129). On this basis, the PFS and OS data for docetaxel from the SELECT-1 trial in patients\nwith KRAS-mutant NSCLC (including G12C and non-G12C mutations) is considered to be sufficiently reflective of\nPFS and OS in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC who receive placebo plus docetaxel. The SELECT-1 trial\nwas therefore considered to be a candidate to provide comparator data for the primary comparison of sotorasib vs. placebo plus docetaxel. This approach was agreed as reasonable by the five UK clinical experts attending an\nAmgen advisory board meeting in February 2021 for the NICE submission (130).",

Sotorasib is a targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation. Sotorasib has only been indirectly compared with current treatment. The results suggest\nthat, after platinum-based chemotherapy, sotorasib increases the time before the cancer gets worse and how long people live compared with current treatment. Sotorasib likely meets NICE's criteria to be a life-extending treatment at the end of life. But\nthere is uncertainty in the clinical evidence. Sotorasib has the potential to be cost\neffective, but more evidence is needed to address the uncertainties before it can be recommended for routine use. The evidence on sotorasib is promising. But, more data is being collected from the primary\nclinical trial and from an ongoing randomised controlled trial comparing sotorasib with docetaxel. Collecting additional data through the Cancer Drugs Fund may resolve some\nuncertainty in the clinical evidence. So, sotorasib is recommended for use in the Cancer\nDrugs Fund. © NICE 2024.

Finally, for one of these factors (the ECOG score), 62% of missing data were imputed using an optimistic imputation method (best case scenario). Overall, a bias in the estimation of the relative efficacy of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) compared to conventional treatments cannot be made, due to the absence of laboratory confusion and an inadequate data management method. The results of the first AATU report are therefore not conclusive and no conclusions can be drawn from it. Note that the laboratory also provided data from the first ATU report. However, due to the limited number (11%) of available follow-up data (insufficient accuracy and possibility of bias), they are unlikely to provide robust evidence to assess the efficacy and tolerability of sotorasib, and will not be described. Due to the non-comparative design of the study, no formal conclusions can be drawn on quality of life.

Sensitivity analyses intended to take into account cross-over (methodes rank preserving structural failure time, inverse probability of censoring weighting, 2-step approaches) showed similar results. Since no statistically significant difference was found in overall survival, the hierarchical sequence was discontinued, and the quality of life criteria were not tested.

The prognostic or predictive value of the KRAS G12C mutation is currently poorly defined in the CBNPC, and there is no (prior to the availability of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib)) specific therapy targeting this mutation. The current therapeutic management of the CRNPC is identical whether or not patients have a KRAS mutation (including G12 C). At the metastatic stage (IV), it is recommended that second-line therapy be offered systematically, whether patients have responded to a first-line metastasis or not. The nature of this treatment depends on the molecules previously used, the ECOG score and the histology: - Patients treated with immunotherapy monotherapy in the first line: chemotherapy based on platinum salts, such as in the 1st line: cisplatin-vinorelbine, cisplatine-citagembine, carboplatin-paclitaxel, cisplain-docetaxel, Cisplatin -pemetrexed (non-epidermoid only); - patients treated with chemotherapeutic therapy + immunotherapies in the line 1: chemotherapists in the single line: pemetrexed, docetaxel (non -epidermoside only). + first-line chemotherapy : monotherapy: docetaxel, pemetrexed (non-epidermoid only) A combination of paclitaxel + bevacizumab may also be proposed; - patients receiving first line bi-chemotherapy, without immunotherapy.: in the absence of a contraindication, immunotherapeutic treatment is the reference: atezolizumab, nivolumab or pembrolizimab (if PD-L1 ≥ 1%), with no hierarchy between these different treatments.

It should be emphasised that, in this context where no data of comparable methodical quality are available to ensure the robustness of the conclusion on the effect of treatment with LUMyKRasib, the introduction of this medicinal product into the therapy strategy must be accompanied by a greater risk for adverse drug reactions than is acceptable on the basis of a summary of product characteristics (RPG) and a comparison with the pharmacological properties of the product (RGP) on which the efficacy summary is based. The Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and the Risk Management Plan (RMP) must be complied with. Use of this medicinal product in pregnant or breast-feeding women must comply with the SPC CONCLUSIONS OF THE COMMISSION Taking all of this information into account and after discussion and voting, the Commission considers that: Advanced non-small cell lung cancer with KRAS G12C mutation is a serious disease with a life-threatening prognosis. LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) is not likely to have an additional public health impact. Taking all these elements into account, the Commission considers that the medical service (MSS) provided by LUMyKRas (sutorasib), is low in the MAMM indication. The Commission gives a favourable opinion on the inclusion of the MSR in the list of reimbursable specialties based on socially assisted specialties, in the absence of a demonstrated impact on morbidity, mortality and quality of life, and on the lack of data to evaluate a possible additional impact on the care and/ or life course.",

Summary & Discussion The application for LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) in the monotherapy indication for the treatment of adult patients with advanced CBNPC with KRAS G12C mutation whose disease has progressed after at least one prior systemic line of therapy is based primarily on a non-comparative Phase 2 basket study (CodeBreak 100) and on data from indirect comparisons. Efficacy (including quality of life) A total of 126 patients with a CBNPC were included. The median age was 64 years, with a similar proportion of men/women (50%) and patients in good general condition, with an ECOG stage of 0 (30%) or 1 (70%). Almost all patients had metastatic disease (96%) and non-epidermoid tumour (99%). In total, 43% of patients had received only one initial line, 35% had received two lines and 22% had received three lines. The main objective analysis was based on 123 patients (corresponding to the September 2020 ICU analysis), with 29% or 37% of patients being considered as having no complete response. Among the secondary endpoints, the median duration of response was 8.4 months (IC95%: 6.9-8.4), the progression-free survival was 6.7 months (I.C. 95%: 4.9-8.1) and the overall survival rate was 12.0 months (9.5-NE).",

However, it should be emphasised that: - the non-comparative design only allows an estimation of the absolute effect of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib), and not its additional relative efficacy compared to the efficacy of existing treatments, the placebo effect and the natural course of the disease; - this result was observed in a selected population (including those with ECOG 0 or 1, no active brain metastases): the transferability of the results to a population with a worse prognosis (OGEC 1, > active brain Metastases) cannot be assured; furthermore, the tolerability profile was marked by an incidence of serious undesirable events of ≥ 3 grades in two out of three patients (51%) and of serious unintended events in ≥ one out of two patients (65%). Given the efficacy and tolerability data (preliminary data in a non-comparative study whereas clinically relevant comparators were available), the limitations in the transferability of the results and the lack of demonstrated impact on quality of life, the additional impact of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) on morbidity-mortality and quality of Life has not been demonstrated to date. Additional data are expected at the EMA level by 31 March 2023 (Phase III CodeBreak 200 study, see next paragraph).",

Advanced non-small cell lung cancer with KRAS G12C mutation is a serious disease with a life-threatening prognosis. It is a medicinal product with a curative intent.  The efficacy/ adverse effect ratio is low.  Therapeutic alternatives are available that are not specific to the KRASG12C gene mutation, in a context where the prognostic and predictive value of this mutation are poorly defined and the absence of specific treatment (before the availability of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib).  It is an option for treatment in patients who have progressed after at least one systemic line of treatment. ❑ Public health concern: ‒ Given the severity of the disease, ‒ partial or complete loss of coverage,  No additional adverse effects reported. ❖ There are non-specific treatment alternatives available in a setting where the clinical prognosis and prediction value of the mutation were poorly understood, and the lack of specific therapy (prior to the introduction of SORTASG) was not available. ‒ This is a treatment option for patients who had progressed at least once before systemic treatment. In view of all these elements, the Commission considers that the medical service provided by LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) remains low in the MAH indication. The Commission gives a favourable opinion on the continuation of the inclusion of LUM YK R AS (sotora- asib) in the list of medicinal products reimbursable to social insured persons and in the List of medicines authorised for use by the public authorities in the MHA indication and dosages.",

One of the experts pointed out that the decision not to include a patient in the drug program due to the co-existence of other cancers should belong to the doctor. The provision on the exclusion of co-occurrence of other tumors is one of the eligibility criteria for the analyzed drug program. 3 clinical recommendations related to the proposed indication were found by: • Polish Society of Clinical Oncology (PTOK 2022); • National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN 2023 v2);• European Society for Medical Oncography (ESMO 2023). In accordance with the ESMO 2023 guidelines, in line II treatment of patients with NDRP with the KRASC G12 mutation, sotorasi is recommended for use in patients who have not responded to previous treatment. The NCCN 2023 guideline for the second-line treatment of patients with NDRP with a KRAS G12C mutation indicates the possibility of using either sotorasib or adagrasib (following at least one prior therapy targeting the KRAS g12c mutation). According to the PTOK 2022 guidelines, the course of the second line treatment for patients with generalised non-small cell lung cancer depends on the clinico-pathomorphological characteristics, the effects of prior systemic therapy, and the molecular characteristics of the tumour. In this group, consideration may be given to the use of chemotherapy (dosectaxel or pemetrexed), docetaxel in combination with nintedanib, EGFR inhibitors in patients who have not received these medicines in the first line, or osymertinib in patients previously treated with first or second generation EGFR blockers, ALK inhibitors if ALK gene rearrangement, immunity (nivolumab or atezolizumab), palliative radiotherapy or symptomatic progression are observed. The positive NICE 2022 recommendation restricts the use of Lumykras to the Cancer Drugs Fund only.",

Typical symptoms include shortness of breath or suffocation, chest pain, bleeding or frequent pneumonia. Primary lung cancer is a tumour originating from epithelial cells. The 4 most commonly recognised histological types are: • glandular cancer (45% - recent increase in incidence); • pancreatic cancer (30%); • small cell carcinoma (15%); • large cell carceroma (10%). NDRP differs from other histological types in that it develops more slowly and is characterized by limited chemical sensitivity.

The costs of the treatment are estimated in the currency of your country, and the health effects are most often expressed in years of life gained (LYG) or quality adjusted life years (QALY) as a result of using the treatment. A comparison of the cost and effect values associated with using the new treatment and their comparison with the cost/benefit values of existing treatments is used to answer the question of whether the health benefit achieved by the individual patient with the new therapy is higher than the cost of the reimbursable treatment. The results of the health cost-effects index are compared with the so-called profitability threshold, i.e. a result that signals that, given the resources of our country (expressed in GDP), the maximum cost of a new therapy, which is expected to be associated with obtaining an individual health effect (1 LYG or 1 QALY) compared to existing therapies, should not exceed three times the GDP per capita.

In addition, results for sotorasib are derived from the uncompleted CodeBreaK 200 and 100 studies. According to the estimates of the economic analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICUR) from the NFZ perspective is at the threshold of profitability It is also noted that according to the budgetary impact analysis estimates, the reimbursement of Lumikras could result in public expenditure in the first and second year of reimbursing respectively. evaluations by other HTAs indicate uncertainty in the efficacy of the drug and cost-effectiveness estimates, therefore final study results are required. The guidelines indicate that sotorasib could be used as a second-line treatment for patients with NDRP with KRAS G12C mutation (PTOK 2022, ESMO 2023, NCCN 2023 v2). Taking into account the Opinion of the Board of Auditors and the potential health benefit, the President of the Agency suggests the possible re-introduction of the Lumira treatment product (sotorasib) in the existing nocturnal group treatment programme and its release free of charge.

It is currently the only inhibitor of Kras G12c approved by the European Medicines Agency, at a dosage of 960 mg/day PO, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. As the biology of lung cancer has become known, new drugs have been developed that act on specific components of the cancer. These drugs are called biologic or targeted therapeutics. These mutations initiate the oncogenic process and activate signaling pathways that the tumour needs to survive. Blocking this signaling can induce apoptosis and tumour regression. This is the framework for the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced CPNPC with mutated KRAS G12C, oral therapeutics and with the possibility of sequential use after chemotherapy or immunotherapy. In case of progression, the second line of treatment for advanced cPNPC consists of docetaxel monotherapy, or with pemetrex or docetaxil + nitendanib combination, or PD-L1 inhibitors such as nivolumab, pembrozolizumab or pentotubes, followed by discontinuous tubulination of the tubule, which reduces the activity of docopib, and a decrease in its activity of an anti-tubulin agent, which is a reducing agent in the circulatory system.

TAIM submitted a phase 1-2 clinical trial, an indirect comparison analysis by MAIC, and interim data from a phase 3 controlled clinical study. Overall quality of evidence was classified as moderate, as a consequence of the immaturity of overall survival outcomes. Moderate quality means moderate certainty of outcome (meaning: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimated effect, but there is a possibility that it may be substantially different). The additional benefit of Lumykras (sotorasib) was assessed in the indication for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with mutated KRAS G12C who have progressed after at least one prior systemic line of therapy. In terms of comparative efficacy, data from the interim analysis of the Phase III clinical trial indicate that treatment with sotorasib resulted in an improvement in progression-free survival of 1.1 months and a 34% reduction in the likelihood of progression or death compared to docetaxel (HR 0.66 [95% CI: 0.51, 0.86], p-value = 0.002), with improvement at 12-month progression assessment (24.8% vs 10.1%) and objective response rate (28.1% [95%CI: 21.5, 35.4] vs 13.2% [95% IC: 8.6, 19.2] Additionally, there was a delay in time to deterioration of overall health status (HR 0,694, 95% CI: 0,530, 95%), physical functioning (HR: 0,692, 951, 0,523, AIC: 0,559, 951) and overall survival was not different between groups. Conclusions The additional benefit of Lumykras (sotorasib) was assessed in the indication for the treatment of adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with mutated KRAS G12C and who had progressed after at least one prior systemic line of therapy It was concluded that no additional benefit for sotorasib was demonstrated over standard docetaxel therapy, and therefore it was not funded in this indication This conclusion was based on the following facts: • Data from the interim analysis of the Phase III CodeBreaK 200K clinical trial showed no difference in overall survival between treatment groups, and a difference in free survival of 1.1 months was observed compared to 12 months (9.00% vs.",

Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer disease worldwide (excluding non-melanocytic skin neoplasms) and the leading cause of death from cancer worldwide. Globally, only 18% of patients will be alive 5 years or more after diagnosis of the disease. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage (not curable), so the incidence and mortality figures are very similar. The WHO estimates that in Portugal 5284 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed in 2020, representing the third most frequent neoplasm in the country (fourth in women). The estimated prevalence of the disease over a period of 5 years is 5 304 cases. The National Oncological Registry data refer to 4 424 new tracheal and bronchial cancer cases in 2018. Among all KRAS mutations, the mono-nucleotide KRAS p.G12C variation, with glycine replaced by cysteine at codon 12, is the most frequent variant, with a prevalence of approximately 7-12% in CPNPC and 13% in adenocarcinomas.",

Docetaxel or other chemotherapy is not always judged as medically appropriate. This may be, for example, in case of poor general condition, significant adverse reactions to previous chemotherapies, or insufficient or short-term disease control with previous therapy. There are no specific treatment recommendations for the more limited patient population. Once all treatment options have been exhausted, generally the best supportive treatment remains for these patients. The relative efficacy between Lumicras and docetaxel is considered to be overestimated and should be reviewed: the overall assessment of TLV based on clinical data is adjusted to reflect the overestimation of the clinical trial data and the analysis should be compared with the over-estimation from the previous health registry (docetaxel 141/ 202) which was assessed to have exceeded the survival rate. A direct comparative study between Lumykras and docetaxel has subsequently been published, in which the efficacy and safety of sotorasib compared to docetaxil in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced NSCLC following progression on prior platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy has been evaluated in an open-label, randomised Phase III study, CodeBreaK 200. CodeBreaK 200 shows no difference in overall survival. The study lacks statistical power to demonstrate a difference in total survival between comparator arms. Due to crossover from docetaxel arm to sotorasibar, the company has also submitted a crossovers adjusted analysis for overall survivorship. In this analysis, a numerical difference is observed in favour of sotorashib compared to docetaxil.",

The company believes that they would not be able to short-circuit the entire docetaxel population of ECO G PS 0 or ECO B PS 1 if the median duration of the adoption of the Code is approximately one month. The reduction in overall survival (1 month) is based on data from CodeBreaK 200 where patients could be randomised to docetaxel and thus were not unsuitable for docetaxil. The decrease in total survival for Lumykras may be greater than 1 month, especially considering that higher ECOG PS than 1 may occur with Lumykra treatment. TLV has therefore performed analyses where the median Lumikras increase is decreased. However, the high cost per gain QALY is not affected to such an extent in poor survival as a result of patients not eligible for Docetaxel being in poor condition. These latter factors affect the cost per QALY downwards. None of the TLV' s calculations of the cost-effectiveness of Lumykras compared to best supportive care result in a cost per earned QALy higher than what TLV would normally assess as reasonable for a very high severity condition. Patients already continuing treatment with Lumykra are covered by the benefit of the limitation of patients not needing to discontinue a treatment interrupting the function of a TLV assessed in patients already continued treatment with subsidised Lumykrac on 1 June 2024.",

TLV, like the company, assesses, based on the treatment recommendations and TLV' s clinical expert, that docetaxel monotherapy is a relevant comparative alternative to Lumykras. In general TLV considers that indirect comparisons have a lower evidence value than direct comparison studies because they are associated with greater uncertainties. Despite the uncertainty associated with the indirect comparison, TLV estimates, based upon the existing evidence, that sotorasib has an efficacy advantage compared to docetaxal with respect to PFS and OS. TL V has made two changes to the company' s health care policy and performed a sensitivity analysis beyond the assumptions. TLW assesses its efficacy against the entire duration of therapy with Lumykra in patients treated with docetaxil over the course of the entire treatment cycle (> 10 years) assuming that there is a greater likelihood of patients being treated with the drug during each cycle. TLV further objects to the company' s method of measuring health-related quality of life by time to death. This means that patients already at the start of treatment have a poorer health- related Quality of Life in the docetaxel arms than in the Lumykras arms, as more patients in the former are predicted to die within a certain period of time. This violates a fundamental modelling principle that the starting point of the model analysis should be as close as possible to the patient.",

The company has in its baseline scenario an analysis in which lumykras arms are modelled directly from CodeBreaK 200, but in which total survival with docetaxil is adjusted to the worse ratio of equal to the crossover-adjusted outcome in Code BreaK 200 in order to mimic more registry data from the Swedish lung cancer registry. The effect of Docetaxel is modelled with a constant hazard ratio, which means that the probability of survival at a given point in time is always lower than that of those who have been treated with LUMYKRA and the likelihood is decreased over the entire time horizon. In a scenario analysis, the company uses data from CodeBreaK 200 where the docetaxel alarm is cross-adjusted but not further down-graded. The indirect comparison which was the basis for the subsidy decision (i. e. 141/2022) is also used by the company as scenario analysis. Regarding overall survival, TLV considers that there is no reason to assume constant treatment effect versus docetaxil. The OS curves do not show constant treatment effects during the follow-up period. Up to month 5 there is a lower risk of death in Lumykras cycles. Then, if there is any, a reverse trend.

The applicant must demonstrate that the conditions under Section 15 of the Benefits Act are fulfilled and submit the research necessary to determine the purchase price and the selling price. Section 15 is clear that a prescription drug is to be covered by the medicinal benefits and the purchasing price and selling price are to be determined for the drug provided that 1. the cost of using the drug, taking into account the provisions of Chapter 3 of Section 1 of the Health and Care Act (2017:30), appears to be reasonable from medical, humanitarian and economic points of view, and 2. there are no other available methods of treatment or assessment of the effects of the drug and a more significant harmful effect as referred in Chapter 1 of Section 4 of the Prevention Act (2015:315) are reasonably foreseeable. The preliminary draft of the Act on Benefits states that the TLV's decision-making is based on three fundamental principles: the principle of human dignity - that care should be provided with respect for the equal value and dignity of all people, the need and solidarity principle that priority should be given to care for those who have the greatest need for health care, and the cost-effectiveness principle ‡ that a reasonable cost-benefit ratio should be pursued, measured in terms of improved health and improved quality of life (see Prop. 2001/02:63 et seq., Prop.",

For the patients subject to present benefit restriction (patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (CNSLC) with KRAS G12C mutation that has progressed after at least one prior systemic treatment), the TLV remains relevant in the previous assessment (docetaxel 141/2022) because the comparator alternative is now considered as another reason to make a different assessment. For the more limited patient population (patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a KRAS G12C mutation that has progressed after at least one prior systemic therapy and who have been treated with docetaxel or who are not medically suitable for treatment with Docetaxel), the TLV considers best supportive care to be the relevant comparator because there are no specific treatment recommendations and other treatment alternatives.
