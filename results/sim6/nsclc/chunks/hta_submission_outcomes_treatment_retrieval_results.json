With docetaxel and pemetrexed, both as monotherapy, two established chemotherapeutic agents are available for second-line chemotherapy, although pemetrexed is unsuitable for predominantly squamous histology. For the combination of docetaxel and nintedanib, which is indicated for adenocarcinoma histology, an indication of a minor additional benefit was identified in the benefit assessment compared to docetaxel monotherapy (resolution of 18 June 2015). In the guidelines, docetaxel in combination with nintedanib is recommended alongside the other chemotherapy options, but is not regularly preferred over them. Based on the available evidence and corresponding therapy recommendations in the guidelines, docetaxel and pemetrexed, each as monotherapy, as well as docetaxel in combination with nintedanib, are considered therapeutically comparable, subject to tumour histology and the different side effect profile. For nivolumab for the treatment of adults after prior chemotherapy and squamous tumour histology, an indication of a major additional benefit was identified in the benefit assessment compared to docetaxel (resolution of 4 February 2016). For nivolumab for the treatment of adults after prior chemotherapy and non-squamous tumour histology, an indication of a major additional benefit was also identified in the benefit assessment compared to docetaxel (resolution of 20 October 2016). For pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, used after prior chemotherapy, the benefit assessment also found an indication of a major additional benefit compared to docetaxel (pembrolizumab: resolution of 2 February 2017, atezolizumab: resolution of 16 March 2018).",

Summary **Source Type:** hta_submission\n\nThis single technology assessment investigates the clinical value of sotorasib (Lumykras™) compared to the relevant current treatment used in Denmark for adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\nwith KRAS G12C mutation who have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. There are several approved treatments targeting specific driver mutations in NSCLC that have improved patient survival significantly compared with non-targeted treatments for patients with an actionable mutation(1). However, currently, no approved treatment is available that specifically targets the KRAS G12C driver mutation in NSCLC. Standard of care treatment for KRAS G12C mutated NSCLC is currently the same as for patients with nontargetable mutations. This includes PD-(L)1 inhibitors (with or without platinum chemotherapy) for first-line (1L)\ntreatment of advanced NSCLC. Nearly all patients progress on these treatments and receive limited benefit from\nSOC cytotoxic chemotherapy treatments in subsequent lines of therapy. Most patients experience a decline in\nperformance status during 1L therapy that limits their tolerance for and the effect of second line and beyond\n(2L+) chemotherapy. Therefore, this patient group (KRAS G12C NSCLC) has a particularly high unmet need for\neffective and tolerable therapies, that can improve survival outcomes without compromising health-related quality of life (HRQoL) including toxicity.",

Study design and baseline characteristics of the\nstudy population are respectively presented in Table 11 and Table 12. The study designs might affect the comparison of outcomes as CodeBreak 100 is an open-label single-arm study and SELECT-1 is a randomized placebo-controlled study. Further, CodeBreak 100 include patients with prior anti-\nPD-1 treatment, whereas there were no patients with prior PD-1 treatment included in SELECT-1. Although\nCodeBreak 100 included patients with 1-3 prior therapies, restricting matches to only patients with 1 prior therapy, as were included in SELECT-1, would reduce the available CodeBreak 100 trial population by 57%, which\nwould have significant implications for the precision of any relative treatment effect estimates. The inability to\nrobustly match for number of prior lines of therapy or prior use of immunotherapy is a potential limitation that arises due to limited comparator trial data specifically in KRAS-mutant NSCLC. However, PFS and OS outcomes\nare likely to be worse for patients with each successive line of therapy. Given that CodeBreak 100 included 57%\nof patients with 2 or more prior lines of therapy, a comparison of PFS and OS data from the whole of the\nCodeBreak 100 NSCLC population against PFS and OS data from patients in SELECT-1, who had received only one prior line of therapy, is likely to be conservative. This assumption is further validated as subgroup analysis from\nCodeBreak 100 showed median OS in patients that received only 1 prior line of therapy was 17.7 months (7.9,\nNE) (Amgen data on file)\nTable 8 patient subgroups by prior lines of therapy (Amgen data on file)\nN mOS\nPatient subgroups\n(OS) months (95% CI) For further assessment of comparability between the studies please consult the MAIC feasibility in Appendix K\n- MAIC.",

Sotorasib is a targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation. Sotorasib has only been indirectly compared with current treatment. The results suggest\nthat, after platinum-based chemotherapy, sotorasib increases the time before the cancer gets worse and how long people live compared with current treatment. Sotorasib likely meets NICE's criteria to be a life-extending treatment at the end of life. But\nthere is uncertainty in the clinical evidence. Sotorasib has the potential to be cost\neffective, but more evidence is needed to address the uncertainties before it can be recommended for routine use. The evidence on sotorasib is promising. But, more data is being collected from the primary\nclinical trial and from an ongoing randomised controlled trial comparing sotorasib with docetaxel.

The company stated that for non-targeted\ntherapies, real-world evidence studies suggest less than 10 months overall survival with second-line treatment and less than 7 months\noverall survival with third-line treatment. This was supported with a\nmedian overall survival of 7.9 months in SELECT-1 and median overall\nsurvival of 10.9 months in LUME-Lung 1. The committee accepted that\nsotorasib meets the short life expectancy criterion for end of life. It noted\na median overall survival gain from the indirect treatment comparisons of sotorasib with docetaxel alone (see section 3.5) from the latest\nMarch 2021 data-cut, at around 15 months of follow up (the exact results are confidential and cannot be reported here). In addition, the model\nestimated an undiscounted mean overall survival gain for sotorasib compared with docetaxel and docetaxel plus nintedanib (the exact\nresults are confidential and cannot be reported here). The committee\nagreed that sotorasib was likely to extend life by over 3 months and therefore meets the extension to life criterion. However, it noted that\nthere were uncertainties with the unanchored indirect treatment comparison methods (see section 3.4). The committee concluded that\nsotorasib may meet both end of life criteria, but the length of life extension is uncertain. © NICE 2024. All rights reserved.

The KRAS G12C mutation is the most common and occurs in 12% of nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours in the UK. This mutation is more\ncommon in non-squamous NSCLC and does not usually occur with other known mutations such as EGFR, ALK and ROS-1. These other known\nmutations may have targeted treatments available but there is currently no targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation. People with KRAS\nG12C mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC usually have chemotherapy, a non-targeted treatment associated with adverse\neffects that affect health-related quality of life. The clinical expert\nhighlighted that people with KRAS G12C mutation-positive NSCLC have a poor prognosis. The clinical and patient experts noted that there is an\nunmet need for effective and tolerable treatments in this population. They also highlighted that the lack of targeted treatment options can have a psychological impact. This condition is associated with difficultto-treat symptoms, and the patient expert submission emphasised the\npsychological impact of these on patients and their carers.

The median age was 64 years, with a similar proportion of men/women (50%) and patients in good general condition, with an ECOG stage of 0 (30%) or 1 (70%). Almost all patients had metastatic disease (96%) and non-epidermoid tumour (99%). In total, 43% of patients had received only one initial line, 35% had received two lines and 22% had received three lines. The main objective analysis was based on 123 patients (corresponding to the September 2020 ICU analysis), with 29% or 37% of patients being considered as having no complete response.

In the absence of direct comparative data, whereas clinically relevant comparators were available, and of major methodological limitations of the indirect comparison provided, the Commission considered that the data did not allow a relatively unbiased assessment of the contribution of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) in the claimed indication, relative to the clinical relevance of the comparators. In support of its request for re-evaluation, the laboratory provided the results of the Phase III study requested by the Commission in its initial opinion. e laboratory also provided additional data from the ATUc Final Report, the 1st Early Access Synthesis Report and an observational study based on the ATuc. e additional data, however, are unlikely to provide robust evidence to assess the efficacy and tolerability of sotorasib, in particular due to a large proportion of missing data. e formal conclusion cannot therefore be drawn. Overall, LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) was shown to be superior to docetaxel in a randomised, open-label study (CodeBreak 200) in 345 patients with KRAS G12C-mutated CBNPCs who received at least one platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy: ‒ In terms of progression-free survival as assessed by an independent review panel using the RECIST criteria HR: 1.1=0.66 [95% CI: 0.51-0.86] (p=0.002). ‒ The median progression free survival according to the independent review committee was 5.6 months (min-max: 0-16.3) in the sotorasib group and 4.5 months ( min-max:21.06) in the docetaxil group, an objective estimate of the absolute difference between the 1.15-month survival rate and the 1.15% response rate (RECIST: 0.9=0.96) in terms of the independent reviewing committee.",

It should be emphasised that, in this context where no data of comparable methodical quality are available to ensure the robustness of the conclusion on the effect of treatment with LUMyKRasib, the introduction of this medicinal product into the therapy strategy must be accompanied by a greater risk for adverse drug reactions than is acceptable on the basis of a summary of product characteristics (RPG) and a comparison with the pharmacological properties of the product (RGP) on which the efficacy summary is based.

It should be emphasised that, in this context where no comparative data of acceptable methodological quality are available to ensure the robustness of the conclusion on the effect of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) treatment, the introduction of this medicinal product into the therapeutic strategy is accompanied by a greater risk-taking than for medicinal products whose efficacy is based on a comparison with an adapted methodology.",

According to the estimates of the economic analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICUR) from the NFZ perspective is at the threshold of profitability It is also noted that according to the budgetary impact analysis estimates, the reimbursement of Lumikras could result in public expenditure in the first and second year of reimbursing respectively. evaluations by other HTAs indicate uncertainty in the efficacy of the drug and cost-effectiveness estimates, therefore final study results are required. The guidelines indicate that sotorasib could be used as a second-line treatment for patients with NDRP with KRAS G12C mutation (PTOK 2022, ESMO 2023, NCCN 2023 v2). Taking into account the Opinion of the Board of Auditors and the potential health benefit, the President of the Agency suggests the possible re-introduction of the Lumira treatment product (sotorasib) in the existing nocturnal group treatment programme and its release free of charge.

The available data are from open-label studies, and the main study CodeBreaK 200 (SOT vs DOC) and the study Code BreaK 100 are ongoing (expected completion date 2026/2027), so the final results are not available. In addition, the studies have other limitations, e. g. the study codeBrea K 200 allowed cross-over with Sotasetab, which may affect the analytical results obtained. Economic assessment, including cost-benefit estimation Economic assessment is the process of estimating and comparing the costs and health effects that may be associated with the use of a new treatment for an individual patient in place of a treatment already reimbursed. The costs of the treatment are estimated in the currency of your country, and the health effects are most often expressed in years of life gained (LYG) or quality adjusted life years (QALY) as a result of using the treatment. A comparison of the cost and effect values associated with using the new treatment and their comparison with the cost/benefit values of existing treatments is used to answer the question of whether the health benefit achieved by the individual patient with the new therapy is higher than the cost of the reimbursable treatment. The results of the health cost-effects index are compared with the so-called profitability threshold, i.e. a result that signals that, given the resources of our country (expressed in GDP), the maximum cost of a new therapy, which is expected to be associated with obtaining an individual health effect (1 LYG or 1 QALY) compared to existing therapies, should not exceed three times the GDP per capita. Currently, the cost-efficiency level is PLN 175 926/QALY (PLN 3 58 x 642).",

One of the experts pointed out that the decision not to include a patient in the drug program due to the co-existence of other cancers should belong to the doctor. The provision on the exclusion of co-occurrence of other tumors is one of the eligibility criteria for the analyzed drug program. 3 clinical recommendations related to the proposed indication were found by: • Polish Society of Clinical Oncology (PTOK 2022); • National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN 2023 v2);• European Society for Medical Oncography (ESMO 2023). In accordance with the ESMO 2023 guidelines, in line II treatment of patients with NDRP with the KRASC G12 mutation, sotorasi is recommended for use in patients who have not responded to previous treatment. The NCCN 2023 guideline for the second-line treatment of patients with NDRP with a KRAS G12C mutation indicates the possibility of using either sotorasib or adagrasib (following at least one prior therapy targeting the KRAS g12c mutation). According to the PTOK 2022 guidelines, the course of the second line treatment for patients with generalised non-small cell lung cancer depends on the clinico-pathomorphological characteristics, the effects of prior systemic therapy, and the molecular characteristics of the tumour. In this group, consideration may be given to the use of chemotherapy (dosectaxel or pemetrexed), docetaxel in combination with nintedanib, EGFR inhibitors in patients who have not received these medicines in the first line, or osymertinib in patients previously treated with first or second generation EGFR blockers, ALK inhibitors if ALK gene rearrangement, immunity (nivolumab or atezolizumab), palliative radiotherapy or symptomatic progression are observed. The positive NICE 2022 recommendation restricts the use of Lumykras to the Cancer Drugs Fund only.",

Typical symptoms include shortness of breath or suffocation, chest pain, bleeding or frequent pneumonia. Primary lung cancer is a tumour originating from epithelial cells. The 4 most commonly recognised histological types are: • glandular cancer (45% - recent increase in incidence); • pancreatic cancer (30%); • small cell carcinoma (15%); • large cell carceroma (10%). NDRP differs from other histological types in that it develops more slowly and is characterized by limited chemical sensitivity. Mutations in the EGFR gene, ALK gene rearrangements and mutations in ROS1 gene are considered to be molecular changes of clinical significance.",

G12C (CodebreaK 200 study). The main exclusion criteria were: number of prior treatment lines greater than three, presence of active brain metastases. Patients were allocated to a single subcutaneous treatment arm at a dose of 960 mg per day. This treatment was maintained until primary disease development, indicative of progressive disease, and the rate of intolerance or consensual toxicity (TRO) was withdrawn. The primary efficacy endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints were duration of response (DR); disease control (CD); time to response; progression-free survival (PFS); overall survivorship (GS). Safety was assessed with an Adverse Event (AE) rate based on version 5 of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. This pre-specified value of 23% was removed from the objective response observed in the ramucirumab treatment arm, in combination with docetaxel, in the Phase III REVEL study. The study was monitored for futility with continuous analyses using Bayana predictive probability, starting after 25 subjects completed 7 weeks of the trial, and additional 10 subjects continued to be assessed after each Phase II CodeBreaK 100 study to obtain a 90% power in detecting an objective response (primary indicator) greater than 23%, with a significance level of 5%.

TAIM submitted a phase 1-2 clinical trial, an indirect comparison analysis by MAIC, and interim data from a phase 3 controlled clinical study. Overall quality of evidence was classified as moderate, as a consequence of the immaturity of overall survival outcomes. Moderate quality means moderate certainty of outcome (meaning: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimated effect, but there is a possibility that it may be substantially different). The additional benefit of Lumykras (sotorasib) was assessed in the indication for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with mutated KRAS G12C who have progressed after at least one prior systemic line of therapy. In terms of comparative efficacy, data from the interim analysis of the Phase III clinical trial indicate that treatment with sotorasib resulted in an improvement in progression-free survival of 1.1 months and a 34% reduction in the likelihood of progression or death compared to docetaxel (HR 0.66 [95% CI: 0.51, 0.86], p-value = 0.002), with improvement at 12-month progression assessment (24.8% vs 10.1%) and objective response rate (28.1% [95%CI: 21.5, 35.4] vs 13.2% [95% IC: 8.6, 19.2] Additionally, there was a delay in time to deterioration of overall health status (HR 0,694, 95% CI: 0,530, 95%), physical functioning (HR: 0,692, 951, 0,523, AIC: 0,559, 951) and overall survival was not different between groups. Conclusions The additional benefit of Lumykras (sotorasib) was assessed in the indication for the treatment of adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with mutated KRAS G12C and who had progressed after at least one prior systemic line of therapy It was concluded that no additional benefit for sotorasib was demonstrated over standard docetaxel therapy, and therefore it was not funded in this indication This conclusion was based on the following facts: • Data from the interim analysis of the Phase III CodeBreaK 200K clinical trial showed no difference in overall survival between treatment groups, and a difference in free survival of 1.1 months was observed compared to 12 months (9.00% vs.",

Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer disease worldwide (excluding non-melanocytic skin neoplasms) and the leading cause of death from cancer worldwide. Globally, only 18% of patients will be alive 5 years or more after diagnosis of the disease. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage (not curable), so the incidence and mortality figures are very similar. The WHO estimates that in Portugal 5284 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed in 2020, representing the third most frequent neoplasm in the country (fourth in women). The estimated prevalence of the disease over a period of 5 years is 5 304 cases. The National Oncological Registry data refer to 4 424 new tracheal and bronchial cancer cases in 2018. Among all KRAS mutations, the mono-nucleotide KRAS p.G12C variation, with glycine replaced by cysteine at codon 12, is the most frequent variant, with a prevalence of approximately 7-12% in CPNPC and 13% in adenocarcinomas.",

The effect of Docetaxel is modelled with a constant hazard ratio, which means that the probability of survival at a given point in time is always lower than that of those who have been treated with LUMYKRA and the likelihood is decreased over the entire time horizon. In a scenario analysis, the company uses data from CodeBreaK 200 where the docetaxel alarm is cross-adjusted but not further down-graded. The indirect comparison which was the basis for the subsidy decision (i. e. 141/2022) is also used by the company as scenario analysis.

TLV, like the company, assesses, based on the treatment recommendations and TLV' s clinical expert, that docetaxel monotherapy is a relevant comparative alternative to Lumykras. In general TLV considers that indirect comparisons have a lower evidence value than direct comparison studies because they are associated with greater uncertainties. Despite the uncertainty associated with the indirect comparison, TLV estimates, based upon the existing evidence, that sotorasib has an efficacy advantage compared to docetaxal with respect to PFS and OS. TL V has made two changes to the company' s health care policy and performed a sensitivity analysis beyond the assumptions. TLW assesses its efficacy against the entire duration of therapy with Lumykra in patients treated with docetaxil over the course of the entire treatment cycle (> 10 years) assuming that there is a greater likelihood of patients being treated with the drug during each cycle. TLV further objects to the company' s method of measuring health-related quality of life by time to death. This means that patients already at the start of treatment have a poorer health- related Quality of Life in the docetaxel arms than in the Lumykras arms, as more patients in the former are predicted to die within a certain period of time.

Docetaxel or other chemotherapy is not always judged as medically appropriate. This may be, for example, in case of poor general condition, significant adverse reactions to previous chemotherapies, or insufficient or short-term disease control with previous therapy. There are no specific treatment recommendations for the more limited patient population. Once all treatment options have been exhausted, generally the best supportive treatment remains for these patients. The relative efficacy between Lumicras and docetaxel is considered to be overestimated and should be reviewed: the overall assessment of TLV based on clinical data is adjusted to reflect the overestimation of the clinical trial data and the analysis should be compared with the over-estimation from the previous health registry (docetaxel 141/ 202) which was assessed to have exceeded the survival rate. A direct comparative study between Lumykras and docetaxel has subsequently been published, in which the efficacy and safety of sotorasib compared to docetaxil in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced NSCLC following progression on prior platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy has been evaluated in an open-label, randomised Phase III study, CodeBreaK 200. CodeBreaK 200 shows no difference in overall survival. The study lacks statistical power to demonstrate a difference in total survival between comparator arms. Due to crossover from docetaxel arm to sotorasibar, the company has also submitted a crossovers adjusted analysis for overall survivorship.

The company believes that they would not be able to short-circuit the entire docetaxel population of ECO G PS 0 or ECO B PS 1 if the median duration of the adoption of the Code is approximately one month. The reduction in overall survival (1 month) is based on data from CodeBreaK 200 where patients could be randomised to docetaxel and thus were not unsuitable for docetaxil. The decrease in total survival for Lumykras may be greater than 1 month, especially considering that higher ECOG PS than 1 may occur with Lumykra treatment. TLV has therefore performed analyses where the median Lumikras increase is decreased. However, the high cost per gain QALY is not affected to such an extent in poor survival as a result of patients not eligible for Docetaxel being in poor condition. These latter factors affect the cost per QALY downwards. None of the TLV' s calculations of the cost-effectiveness of Lumykras compared to best supportive care result in a cost per earned QALy higher than what TLV would normally assess as reasonable for a very high severity condition.
