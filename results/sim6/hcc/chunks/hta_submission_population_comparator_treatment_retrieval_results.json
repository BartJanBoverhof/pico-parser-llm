This\nappraisal was a Cancer Drugs Fund reconsideration of the published NICE technology appraisal guidance on sorafenib for treating advanced\nhepatocellular carcinoma. 3.2 The company's original submission presented clinical effectiveness data\nfrom the SHARP study.

Furthermore, it must be noted that no usable data are available for the selection of specific AEs. In this situation, it is conceivable that the overall conclusion on added benefit may change materially if the missing information became available, since the presented event rates also\nreveal potential disadvantages of lenvatinib.

[LoE: 3b; weak consensus]. e Dokumente anderer Organisationen zu möglichen Komparatoren\nRecommendations\n1.1 Sorafenib is recommended as an option for treating advanced\nating hepatocellular carcinoma only for people with Child-Pugh grade A liver impairment, only if the company provides sorafenib within the agreed\ncommercial access arrangement. 1.2 This recommendation is not intended to affect treatment with sorafenib\nthatwas started in the NHS before this guidance was published. People\nhaving treatment outside this recommendation may continue without change to the funding arrangements in place for them before this\nguidance was published, until they and their NHS clinician consider it appropriate to stop. Evidence:\n3.1 The appraisal committee (section 6) considered evidence submitted by\nBayer and a review of this submission by the evidence review group. This\nappraisal was a Cancer Drugs Fund reconsideration of the published NICE technology appraisal guidance on sorafenib for treating advanced\nhepatocellular carcinoma. 3.2 The company's original submission presented clinical effectiveness data\nfrom the SHARP study. SHARP was a multicentre, double-blind, placebocontrolled, randomised trial in patients with advanced hepatocellular\ncarcinoma who had not received previous systemic treatment. The study\nincluded 602 patients and assessed the effect of sorafenib plus best supportive care (n=299) compared with placebo plus best supportive care\n(n=303). The primary outcomes in\nSHARP were overall survival and time to symptomatic progression. NCCN\nN, 2017 [13]",

For patients aged 75 years or older, there is no hint of added benefit of lenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib for the outcome of diarrhoea; therefore, there is no proof of added benefit for this outcome in this patient group. Regarding the outcomes of fatigue, pain, jaundice, fever, and abdominal swelling, which were surveyed using EORTC QLQ-HCC18, there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups for the total study population. For these outcomes, this results in no hint of added benefit of lenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib.  Health status For health status surveyed using the European Quality of Life – 5 Dimensions Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-5D VAS), no usable data are available.

The HR and the corresponding 2sided 95% CI were estimated using a Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group as a factor, and stratified by the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors. Superiority hypotheses were tested for OS using a stratified log-rank test with the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors. No multiplicity adjustments were needed for testing of the non-inferiority and superiority of OS due to the closed testing principle. Two interim analyses were performed. Since the study was not stopped at the first or second interim analysis, non-inferiority for OS was tested first at the final analysis with a non-inferiority margin of 1.08, which indicated that lenvatinib preserved at least 60% (corresponding to δ = 0.60) of the sorafenib treatment effect versus placebo as observed in the sorafenib SHARP and Asia-Pacific trials [5,6].

The Committee does not expect that the imbalance between the study arms will have a significant impact on the efficacy estimates. Results and assessment of the endpoints prespecified by the Panel as critical and important, respectively, are as follows: overall survival, OS (critical) Survival is a critical endpoint as HCC is a fatal disease. The Panel wants the endpoint to be expressed as median survival and survival rates at 12 and 24 months. Table 3. Median survival in the lenvatinib arm median overall survival is 13.6 months, compared to 12.3 months in the sorafenib arm. This corresponds to a difference of 1.3 months in favour of lenvatitinib. The SCC has assessed that any difference of 3 months or more is clinically relevant. Lenvatinib does not meet this requirement. The relative difference in efficacy for the median hazard survival ratio (HR) is 0.92 [0.71,06] and shows that there is no statistically significant difference between treatments. Survival rates After 12 months of treatment, 55% of patients are alive in the lenvatinib arm, while the corresponding figure for the sorafenib arm is 50%. Thus, there is a difference of 5 percentage points in favour of lenvitinib. This difference is less than the difference of 8 percentage points defined in the protocol as the least clinically relevant difference.",

The stages are divided by tumor stage, liver function status, physical status and cancer-related symptoms. Overall, HCC patients are categorized into those with early HCC who benefit from curative therapy, those with intermediate and advanced disease who have benefited from palliative treatments, and finally patients who have terminal disease who are offered symptomatic treatment.[3] Patients with early disease (BCLCC A) are evaluated for surgical removal of the tumor, liver transplantation or percutaneous ablation (destruction of cancer cells by means of subtle chemotherapy or hyper-hypothermia, where in particular radiofrequency (RFA) therapy has been introduced in Denmark) with the possibility of five-year recovery, and have a high incidence of hepatohepatitis over five years, and do not have symptoms and are still dependent on interstitial treatment.[3] About 50-75 percent of the patients with BCC who respond to this treatment have no symptoms or no symptoms are still undergoing treatment with liver cancer (BBCLC A, BCLC A) or in childhood cancer.[3] In the advanced stage (stage C BCLC), patients still have liver function equivalent to Child-Pugh A or B, but are no longer candidates for topical treatment as they have symptoms of cancer and/ or vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread [3]. Thus, they are assessed for 1st line systemic therapy with the multicinase inhibitor sorafenib. Lenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced stage HCC or patients with inoperable HCC who have not previously received systemic treatment. Lenwatinib is a multi-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits growth factor receptors VEGF receptor 1-3, FGF receptor 1-4, and PDGF α, as well as the proto-oncogenes RET and KIT, all of which are central to cancer development.",

The incidence for the period 2011-2015 is 429 new cases per year (303 cases in men; 126 cases in women).[1] Development of HCC occurs most often in patients who have cirrhosis of the liver.[2] The liver function of patients with liver diseases such as cirrhomosis can be divided by how good the liver function is, and is referred to in the categories Child-Pugh A, B and C, from best to worst liver function. At the end of 2015, 652 patients had HCC, which reflects the low survival for this patient group.",

On this basis, they also commented that\ntreatment should be restricted to people with Child-Pugh grade A liver function and performance status of 0 to 2. Taking all the evidence into\naccount, the committee concluded that people with Child-Pugh grade A liver function are the appropriate population for its recommendations for\ntreating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with sorafenib in England. 4.22 The committee understood that the final draft guidance issued during\nthe original appraisal went to an appeal panel. It was aware that the\nappeal panel concluded that there was opportunity to comment on overall survival modelling and dismissed all appeal points.

The committee was aware that there was a\nhigher proportion of patients with metastatic disease in the unfunded group. The committee noted that patients who did not receive funding\nfor sorafenib did not live as long as patients who did have funding. It also\nconsidered that the association between funding and death may be confounded, that is, patients with better prognoses might be more likely\nto receive funding and treatment than patients with poorer prognoses. It\nnoted the ERG's comment that the study was not suitable for decisionmaking. However, the committee could not exclude the possibility of\nresidual confounding and concluded that the data from Palmer were a less robust source of evidence than the GIDEON data, now matched to\nSHARP.

In its response to the appraisal\nconsultation document, the company claimed that resource estimates from the original appraisal were no longer accurate because of\nsignificant changes in clinical practice.

Also, the committee understood from the ERG that the\nICER was extremely sensitive to changes in these parameters.

In addition, when taking these criteria into account, the committee must be persuaded that the estimates of the extension to life are robust and that the\nassumptions used in the reference case economic modelling are plausible, objective and robust. 4.15 The committee discussed whether the benefit provided by sorafenib in\nhepatocellular carcinoma fulfilled the criteria for consideration as a lifeextending, end-of-life treatment. It noted from the clinical studies that\nlife expectancy without sorafenib was unlikely to be greater than\n24 months and was potentially as low as 7.9 months, although the latter\nwas based on SHARP, which was stopped early. The committee\nconsidered that evidence from the clinical studies of sorafenib plus best supportive care suggested that it increased median survival by more\nthan 2.8 months compared with placebo plus best supportive care, and\nthe company's economic model predicted a mean gain in overall survival of 6.1 months, although this depended on the method of extrapolation. Although the committee noted that sorafenib is licensed for indications other than hepatocellular carcinoma, the committee considered sorafenib\nto fulfil the small population criterion for an end-of life treatment.",

Regarding first-line treatments, for several years sorafenib was the only systemic treatment available for HCC. While the safety profile of sorafenub was acceptable in the context of this disease, the overall prognosis of HCC with this treatment continued to be unsatisfactory. This led to numerous trials to try to obtain new alternatives. In 2018, the REFLECT trial demonstrated non-inferiority of lenvatinib with respect to lenfenib (25). All patients had locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic CHC, for which they had not received prior systemic therapy. Stratification was performed by geographical region (Asia [excluding Japan] vs. rest of the world), macrovascular invasiveness and/ or dissemination (BC), absenteeism vs. absence of athezolizumab-bevacizumab: sorafenib, open-label, multicentre and international phase III clinical trial comparing a arm of patients treated with the atezolizumab/ bevacizumab combination versus a arm treated with sorapenib. It should be noted that IMbrave150 is the first CHC trial in which a therapeutic option is statistically significantly superior to another treatment compared, rather than to placebo.

Following these three trials, sorafenib remained for years as the only alternative in the systemic treatment of HCC. In 2018, in the phase III and non-inferiority REFLECT trial, lenvatinib (Lenvima®) achieved an OS of 13.6 months compared to 12.3 with soraphenib. After marking the limits of non inferiority and superiority, the results showed that levantinib was not inferior to sorafenab.

Stratification was performed by geographical region (Asia [excluding Japan] vs. rest of the world), macrovascular invasion and/ or extrahepatic dissemination (presence vs. absence), baseline alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels (ng< 400m/ L vs. ≥ 400 m/ L) and overall status (0 ECOG vs. group 1). Patients randomised to the sorafenib group received 400 mg of the drug, orally, twice daily. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or loss of benefit. Therapy could be continued beyond progression if there was evidence of clinical benefit at the discretion of the investigator. No dose adjustments were allowed in the atezolizumab-bevacizumab arm, but were permitted in the Sorafenib arm. Tumor assessments were performed every 6 weeks for one year and subsequently every 9 weeks. The targets of the study were, as primary targets, overall survival (OS) (time from randomisation to death from any cause) and progression-free survivorship (PFS) (Time from randomization to tumour progression defined by RISTEC 1.1 criteria or death by any cause). The secondary endpoints were the objective response rate (percentage of patients with partial or complete response) following RECIST 1.1 and modified RESIST criteria for liver disease (mRECIST), duration of response (time from partial to complete response to disease progression or exit), and deterioration in patient quality of life (based on the EORTC QLQ-C30 test and the Eortc QLq-HCC18 test).

The estimated clinical benefit would be 5, considering the HR 0.58 and a difference of 9.6 months in SG from the extrapolation of the KM curves (22). The recently published updated analysis of an additional 12 months of follow-up shows somewhat reduced outcomes (HR 0.66 and difference from medians of 5.9 months), but with that benefit the assessment would be maintained (21). DISCUSSION HCC is one of the most impactful neoplasms in terms of morbimortality despite the availability of a screening targeted at risk population and a well-established diagnostic algorithm (23). See Annex, Figure 2. To date, no biomarkers have been identified that serve as predictors of response to one treatment or another, or that are able to predict longer or shorter survival of patients (24). In recent years there have been advances from the therapeutic point of view with several drug positions in the treatment algorithm. In 2008, in the SHARP study, sorafenib achieved a median SG of 10.7 vs. 7.9 months in placebo-treated patients, with a HR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.55-0.87, p < 0.001) (12). In 2009, the Asia-Pacific study (NCT00492752) was published where the SG with soraphenib was 6.5 months vs. 4.2 with placebo with HR 95% of 0.68 (IC 0.5-0.93, p 0.014) - Lenvatinib (Lenvima®): In 2018, in the REFLECT study, lenvatinib achieved an SG of 13.6 vs. 12.3 months with sorafenub.",

According to the latest available data, globally, HCC ranks seventh in incidence and fourth in direct mortality from cancer (1). The incidence of HCC increases with age (exceptionally it occurs before 40 years and the median age at diagnosis in our midst is between 65-70 years), being more frequent in men than in women (2). The rate of incidence is higher in western and south-eastern Africa, where the main etiological factors are hepatitis B and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection.",

MEDICAL NEEDS Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common of the liver cancers (approximately 90%) 1 with an estimated incidence in France of approximately 9,600 new cases per year in 2018 2. This type of liver cancer develops most often on a renal cirrhosis (80% to 90% of cases) of various types (primary hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, diabetes mellitus). The prognosis of primary liver cancer remains one of the worst of all cancers with a 5-year survival rate of less than 15%.3 The management of HCC depends on the stage of the disease and the general condition of the patients4,5,6,7. Unlike other solid tumors, for which the therapeutic decision is made based on the TNM classification, there is no consensus prognostic classification for HCC7. Therefore, several classifications or scores have been proposed including the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 8 classification which has the advantage of enabling a prognosis stratification and proposing a treatment algorithm. When HCC is at an early stage (BC 0-A), patients are generally eligible for curative treatment by surgery, radiosurgery or transplantation. In case of failure, refractory disease or ineligibility for TACE, or in the presence of vascular invasion and/ or extrahepatic injury (advanced stage CLC), treatment with sorafenib is recommended in patients with preserved general condition (ECOG ≤ 2) and preserved hepatic function (Child-Pugh A). In adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (stage BCLC B or C) who have not received prior systemic therapy, the medical need is therefore considered to be partially met by sorafenib. However, there remains a medical need for better tolerated and/ or more effective treatments at this stage of the disease.",

As these may mainly involve fatigue, bleeding and abdominal pain, most of the patients studied had a Child-Pugh stage liver failure, there are limited data on safety and tolerability in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Experience According to the Periodic Safety Update Report for the first half of 2007, 19,086 patients were treated during that period (8740 commercially and 10,346 in clinical trials). 1The term \" adverse reactions\" refers to complaints and symptoms regardless of cause. Clinical pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely with concomitant use of agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 (midazolam, dextromethorphan, omeprazole). It cannot be excluded that sorafenib increases the concentrations of co-administered P-gp substrates (such as digoxin), CYP2B6 (like bupropion, cyclophosphamide, efavirenz, metronidazole), CYP8C2 (like paclitaxel, amodiaquine, repaglinide), or CYP2C9 (like acetoacetylsalicylate). Conclusion: There is an interaction between the concomitant use of sorafenib and inducers of CYP3A4 activity. There are no data on the efficacy and adverse effects of Sorafenib in children and adolescents. 4.f. Ease of use The recommended dose of soferanib is 400 mg (2 tablets of 200 mg) 2 times a day. The tablets are to be taken with one meal per day.

Based on these assumptions, the total cost of sorafenb for the treatment of hepatocelllular carcino- mas is approximately EUR 2.2 to 2.7 million on an annual basis. Since maximum market penetration is unlikely to be achieved in the first year, the following table presents the costs of soravenib for the next three years.

For these patients, no other pharmaceutical treatment costs are available, so that the full cost of using sorabenib is no longer borne by the CHF. The recommended dose of sorafenib is 400 mg twice a day. Treatment should be continued for as long as the patient has medical benefit or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. The manufacturer estimates that the average duration of treatment is 5 months (155 days), based on the average length of treatment in studies with the use of the average dose of Sorafenib in place of 710 mg per day, which was also recorded in two clinical trials, where the cost of the dose was 800 mg. The average cost of treatment with sorafenib is € 135.43 per day (i. e. 1 prescription per month, including VAT, delivery charge and clawback) at a dose of 800 mg per day.",

Cheung (020) 797 88 10 Subject Assessment of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma Dear Mr Klink, In your letter of 6 December 2007, you requested the Health Insurance Council (HIC) to assess whether Nexavar® (sorafenib) is interchangeable with a medicine included in the insured package. If not, you are requested to assess the therapeutic value of this medicine for the indication for which reimbursement has been requested. This medicine is included in Annex 1B of the health insurance regulation and is currently being assessed for the treatment of a new cancer, i. e. This review concerns a new indication, namely the use of sorafenib in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer). You have granted the manufacturer of the medicine Nexavar® an exemption for a pharmaco-economic study. The Pharmaceutical Aid Committee (CFH) of the CVZ has now completed the substantive review. The considerations herein are contained in the CFH Report 08/03 attached as an annex. On the basis of this opinion of CFH and administrative considerations, the CDC has adopted its opinion on Nexavir® (sorafenib) in hepatocell carcinomas. CVZ Opinion The CVZ recommends that you extend the detailed conditions for Nexaver® to Annex 2 of the Health Insurance Regulations. This extension covers a subgroup of patients with hepatotoxicity to sorafenil per year, 164 patients were enrolled in the Netherlands in 1989-2000 (more than one patient per year). Background In the Netherlands, during the period 1989-2000, 1964 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled (an average of 164 patients per year). The 5-year survival rate was 7% and the 1-year survivorship rate was 22%.",

The annual incidence of this type of cancer is 1/10,000 residents. Iodine-refractory cancer affects 2/3\nof patients with distant metastases who did not achieve a complete response during iodine therapy. This\ncondition is extremely rare and affects 4-5 patients in 1 million (about 250 people per year in France). The natural course of thyroid cancer has a positive prognosis if the treatment is commenced at an early stage\n(95-98% of patients survive at least 5 years). While in most cases differentiated thyroid cancer is treatable,\nlocally advanced or metastatic cancer or cancer refractory to radioactive iodine (RAI) is more resistant and is associated with shorter patient survival, of up to 2.5–3.5 years. About 5-15% of patients become refractory\nto RAI therapy, 66% survive 5 years and 10% survive approx. 10 years. The prognosis for differentiated thyroid\ncancers (DTCs) is better in younger patients. The growth of differentiated cancers is slow, which can lead to a false belief that the nodule is benign. Approximately 5% of patients are diagnosed at a late stage, in the generalised dissemination phase, when the prognosis is worse and despite treatment, only approx. 50% of patients survive 10 years. The formation of\nnon-iodine avid distant metastases is particularly unfavourable. Based on the identified guidelines and the opinions of clinical experts, best supportive care was selected as the alternative therapy to sorafenib. In line with the opinion of the expert cited by the applicant, currently the analysed patient population is treated with BSC, which includes thyroid hormone therapy, bisphosphonates, analgesics and corticosteroids,\nas well as palliative radiotherapy.",

The proposed payment and reimbursement availability category: a free-of-charge drug available as part of a\ndrug programme, within the 1078.0 Sorafenib joint-limit group. The applicant has proposed a risk-sharing\nscheme. Thyroid cancer is a malignant tumour originating:\n• from thyroid follicular cells:\no differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC),\n▪ papillary thyroid cancers (PTC),\n▪ follicular thyroid cancers (FTC),\n▪ Hürthle cell carcinoma (HCC), o undifferentiated cancer (anaplastic – 2-5%),\n• from calcitonin-producing C-cells (peridicular),\no medullary cancer (5%). The clinical presentation of thyroid cancer is unspecific. A developing nodule does not differ from benign\nnodules, therefore early diagnosis is only possible through fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Lymph node\nmetastases are more common in Hürthle cell tumours compared to FTC. In some cases, the first noticeable symptom of the disease are cervical lymph nodes enlarged due to metastases. In about 5% of cases, distant metastases have already occurred, and they can be the first\nsymptoms leading to the diagnosis. Rapid growth of the nodule, its impermeability on the skin or hoarseness (a sign of infiltration of the laryngeal nerve) occurs at an advanced stage. Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant tumour of the endocrine glands. Its incidence is about 7.4 in\nwomen and 1.7/100,000/year in men. The onset of the disease may occur at any age, peaking between 40\nand 50 years of age. The number of thyroid cancer cases according to the KRN [National Cancer Registry] data\nfor 2015 was 3,529 patients, of which about 605 were men and 2,924 were women.

HCCs occur in 90% of situations in a cirrhosis context, with the main risk factors in the Western world being hepatitis C virus infection and alcoholism. In the Eastern world there is a high prevalence of hepatitis B (which has been shown to have a direct oncogenic effect). In Portugal, for 2015 and based on the ROR-Sul data, it is estimated that about 360 new cases have been diagnosed nationally.

However, based on its cost-to-life comparison and the prevailing indirect uncertainty in the company comparison between STRIDEs and atezozumab, the TLV also assumes comparable effectiveness between TLVs for the PFS effect. Efficacy and safety of lenvatinib compared to sorafenib have been studied in the Phase III non-inferiority study REFLECT [10], which showed comparable efficacy between the alternatives for efficacy measures OS. The company has indirectly compared STRIDE with lenvatitinib with an anchored MAIC based on the HIMALAYA and REFLECT studies, both of which had Sorafenib as a comparator. For PFS, there were differences in its definition in HIMALAYA and REFLECT. The hazard ratio for PFS for STRIDE compared to sorafenib after adjustments for the HIMALYA population was [--]. This is to be compared with the hazard rate for lenvatinib compared to Sorafenib in REFLEECT which was 0.65 (95% CI 0.560.77). Based on this, the risk ratio was calculated as follows:",

More than two-thirds of HCC occurs in cirrhotic livers, but HCC can also occur in livers without cirrhomosis, especially in non-alcoholic fatty liver, chronic hepatitis B and porphyria. Risk factors to HCC are mainly viruses (hepatitis B and C), liver toxicity (alcohol and aflatoxin), and metabolic diseases (diabetes mellitus, hepatic fatty hepatitis, hemochromatosis, which affects the liver). The survival rate of patients with hepatitis B or porphyry can be reduced by up to 3 months after treatment, depending on the medication used.[1] The median survival time for patients with liver palliative disease is 40 years, but the average survival is less than 3 years after treatment.[1] Imfinzi, a medicine containing the active substance durvalumab, received its first marketing authorisation in Europe on 21 September 2018 and the last indication was obtained on 14 April 2023. Imjudo, a medicinal product containing the Active Substance tremelimumab received its marketing authorisations in Europe as of 20 February 2023. Imjudo in combination with Imfinzi is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced or non-resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Tremelimumab and durvalumab are checkpoint inhibitors that enhance the anti-tumour response of the immune system. Tremelemumab exerts its function early in the immune response while durvelumab is expected to exert its effect later in the immunological response.[2] Tremelamumab, a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody, targets cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, CTLA-4, which is primarily expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes. Binding of CTLA-4 to the ligands CD80 and CD86 limits T cell activation. Imjudo is given as a single 300-milligram dose administered in combination with 1,500 milligrams of Imfinzi in Cycle 1 on Day 1, followed by Im finzi every four weeks as monotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [3].",

The treatment of advanced HCC is not differentiated by whether the disease has a viral or non-viral etiology. According to TLV's clinical expert today, etiology is not taken into account in the selection of the treatment regimen. The expert believes that at present there is no evidence that etiology has any relevance for the response to treatment. I published the study from IM150 in which atezozizumab+ bevaxizumab was compared to bevajizumab as a treatment for HCC and no difference in efficacy was observed in patients with atherosclerosis (≥ 95%) in the subgroup of 1,05 to 1,68 patients with HCC plus sorafenil (≥ KIHRK1,63) [5]. According to the TLV clinical expert, this subgroup analysis can only be hypothetical and should be studied further. This interpretation is in line with the interpretation of the authors of the publication [5]. Furthermore, the expert has stated that there is a great need for treatment alternatives regardless of the etiology. Based on this, TLV considers that for this health-economic assessment, a division of the population into respective non-viral etiologies is not sufficiently justified. STRIDE compared to sorafenib in the HIMALAYA study [6] Treatment with STRADE has been evaluated against sorafenb in the Phase 3 HIMALYA study with an estimated end date of August 2024 [7].",

At these time points, only a small proportion of patients are still progression-free and on treatment according to extrapolated PFS and TTD curves (TTD, Time on Treatment). Approximately 97 percent have progressed by 6 years and approximately 2 percent are on treatment with STRIDA. TLV presents sensitivity analyses to show how the outcome is affected by other assumptions. Progression-free survival in the comparison between STRIDE and sorafenib The company' s modelling of PFS implies that the risk of progressing is [--] for patients treated with STRIDE compared to sorapenib over a long period of time. TLV estimates that both the proportion of patients who are progression- free over time and the efficacy benefit assumed by the company may be overestimated. The company ' s modeling of the PFS and duration of treatment (TTD curve, see more in section 3.2.1) for STRIDA also imply that after a period, the percentage of patients are progress- free is [--]. TLV adjusts the extrapolated PFS curve to STRIDS by assuming the risk for progressing in both treatment cycles is the same at 35 months, which coincides with the 10th time point of the STRIDIE and KM curve (see KM Curve for PFS). Total survival and progression-free survival in the comparison between STRIDE and Lenvima TLV considers that there are uncertainties in the company' s modelling of OS and PFS for Lenvimi.",

TLV assumes that Lenvima treatment can be continued after progression, which is the same as the assumption made for STRIDE and sorafenib. TLV assumed that 40 percent of patients receive follow-up treatment. After treatment with Stride, half of the patients are assumed to receive soraphenib and half of those patients are considered to be receiving sorafenima. Patients treated with first-line Lenven or Lenven are equally divided between Stivarga (regorafenib) and Cabometyx (kabozantinib). TLV presents sensitivity analyses with other assumptions about follow-on treatments. The Company reports a cost comparison between STRIDE and Tecentriq plus bevacizumab. The Company' s cost comparisons include drug and drug administration costs. Based on the indirect comparison reported by the Company (see section 2.4.2), it is assumed that treatment with Tecentrq + bevazizumab would result in a longer progression-free survival compared to STRIDES. Therefore, drug and medication administration costs are calculated according to the PFS curves for the respective treatments.",
