Despite worse survival rates\ncompared to PVB thrombosis, PVT in the MPV should not be considered an absolute contraindication to TACE. 5.

Fazit der Autoren: (…) For the comparison of RFA to PEI/PAI, our\nconclusions suggest that for these patients treatment with RFA confers a survival benefit at 3 years compared with PEI/PAI. In addition, TTP and\nlocal recurrence may be improved in patients treated with RFA compared with PEI/PAI. Patients treated with RFA also seem to have longer LOS\nafter treatment compared with those treated with PEI/PAI. Beyond this\nevidence on the comparative effectiveness of these procedures was insufficient. Subsequent comparisons had only one or no comparative\nstudies on a given treatment comparison. For these comparisons,\nevidence was insufficient for all outcomes; thus, there is no comparative\nevidence base to support decision making. In cases where comparative\nevidence existed, data were judged to be insufficient due to high risk of bias and/or imprecision of estimates. 1.

Therefore, we conducted a metaanalysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sorafenib for treating patients\nwith advanced HCC. Population: adult patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) HCC\nIntervention: sorafenib or sorafenib-based therapy\nKomparator: placebo or placebo-based (without sorafenib) therapy\nEndpunkte: primary: overall survival (OS); secondary: time to progression\n(TTP), overall response rate (ORR), and toxicity\nSuchzeitraum (Aktualität der Recherche): bis 03/2014\nAnzahl eingeschlossene Studien/Patienten (Gesamt): 7 (n=3807)\nQualitätsbewertung der Studien: The methodological quality of each study\nwas assessed with the Jadad scale. 3.",

The primary objective of the REFLECT study was to compare OS in patients treated with\nlenvatinib versus sorafenib as a first-line treatment for unresectable stage B or C (according to BCLC staging system) HCC and Child Pugh Class A liver disease. The secondary objectives of the study were:\n To compare Progression-free survival (PFS), Time-to progression and Objective response rate of subjects treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib using (mRECIST)\n To compare the impact of treatment on generic Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) of subjects treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HCC18 questionnaires\n To compare safety and tolerability of subjects treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib\n To characterize the PK of lenvatinib using the population approach\n To assess the PK/PD relationship between exposure and efficacy/safety. The exploratory objectives of the study were:\n To compare DCR of subjects treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib using mRECIST\n To compare the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of subjects treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib\n To compare the impact of treatment on generic HRQoL factors for subjects treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib using the European Quality of Life questionnaire\n To explore blood and tumour biomarkers which may correlate with clinical outcomes-related endpoints.

The HR and the corresponding 2sided 95% CI were estimated using a Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group as a factor, and stratified by the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors. Superiority hypotheses were tested for OS using a stratified log-rank test with the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors. No multiplicity adjustments were needed for testing of the non-inferiority and superiority of OS due to the closed testing principle. Two interim analyses were performed. Since the study was not stopped at the first or second interim analysis, non-inferiority for OS was tested first at the final analysis with a non-inferiority margin of 1.08, which indicated that lenvatinib preserved at least 60% (corresponding to δ = 0.60) of the sorafenib treatment effect versus placebo as observed in the sorafenib SHARP and Asia-Pacific trials [5,6].

We would like to supplement our application with additional evidence from, and further\nclarification of, the REFLECT clinical trial results, that show the added clinical value of lenvatinib in the treatment of HCC.

A statement of expert opinion from a clinical expert is also enclosed to provide additional evidence. The Medicines Council used the Cochrane GRADE approach to evaluate evidence quality from the\nREFLECT study. According to the Medicine Council’s assessment report, the open-label nature of REFLECT\nimpacted the level of evidence quality with respect to:\n- Blinding of subjects (performance bias) - adverse events and health-related quality of life (HRQoL)\n- Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) - adverse events and HRQoL\nAn open-label design was necessary in the interests of patient safety because dose modification guidelines due to toxicity were different for lenvatinib and sorafenib for the same toxicities. In addition, the differences in\nformulation between lenvatinib (capsule) and sorafenib (tablet) would have required preparation of multiple matching placebo capsules or tablets to permit dose reductions.",

The committee noted that patients who did not receive funding\nfor sorafenib did not live as long as patients who did have funding. It also\nconsidered that the association between funding and death may be confounded, that is, patients with better prognoses might be more likely\nto receive funding and treatment than patients with poorer prognoses. It\nnoted the ERG's comment that the study was not suitable for decisionmaking. However, the committee could not exclude the possibility of\nresidual confounding and concluded that the data from Palmer were a less robust source of evidence than the GIDEON data, now matched to\nSHARP.

It noted that lenvatinib was predicted to have higher or lower life expectancy than sorafenib, depending on th choice of overall-survival function. The committee understood that this was an artefact of the company's modelling approach. The choice of survival function for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and sorafenib was informed directly by IMbrave150 data. Survival for lenvatinib was informed by applying a hazard ratio from the NMA to the function for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. The committee agreed that it would have been preferable to apply the hazard ratio from the NMA for lenvatinib compared with sorafenib to the sorafenib survival function, because the drugs have a similar mechanism of action. However, it wou not expect this to have much effect on cost effectiveness. The committee concluded that it would consider cost-effectiveness results using the log-normal function to model survival, because this was the best-fitting function. But the log-logistic and generalised gamma functions were plausible and should also be considered. © NICE 2024. All rights reserved.

Stratification was performed by geographical region (Asia [excluding Japan] vs. rest of the world), macrovascular invasion and/ or extrahepatic dissemination (presence vs. absence), baseline alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels (ng< 400m/ L vs. ≥ 400 m/ L) and overall status (0 ECOG vs. group 1). Patients randomised to the sorafenib group received 400 mg of the drug, orally, twice daily. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or loss of benefit. Therapy could be continued beyond progression if there was evidence of clinical benefit at the discretion of the investigator. No dose adjustments were allowed in the atezolizumab-bevacizumab arm, but were permitted in the Sorafenib arm. Tumor assessments were performed every 6 weeks for one year and subsequently every 9 weeks. The targets of the study were, as primary targets, overall survival (OS) (time from randomisation to death from any cause) and progression-free survivorship (PFS) (Time from randomization to tumour progression defined by RISTEC 1.1 criteria or death by any cause). The secondary endpoints were the objective response rate (percentage of patients with partial or complete response) following RECIST 1.1 and modified RESIST criteria for liver disease (mRECIST), duration of response (time from partial to complete response to disease progression or exit), and deterioration in patient quality of life (based on the EORTC QLQ-C30 test and the Eortc QLq-HCC18 test). From March 2018 to January 2019, 501 patients from 111 hospitals and 17 countries were included, who were randomly assigned to receive atezobevacizumab (336 patients) or sorafenib (165 patients), based on statistical characteristics.",

The estimated clinical benefit would be 5, considering the HR 0.58 and a difference of 9.6 months in SG from the extrapolation of the KM curves (22). The recently published updated analysis of an additional 12 months of follow-up shows somewhat reduced outcomes (HR 0.66 and difference from medians of 5.9 months), but with that benefit the assessment would be maintained (21). DISCUSSION HCC is one of the most impactful neoplasms in terms of morbimortality despite the availability of a screening targeted at risk population and a well-established diagnostic algorithm (23). See Annex, Figure 2. To date, no biomarkers have been identified that serve as predictors of response to one treatment or another, or that are able to predict longer or shorter survival of patients (24). In recent years there have been advances from the therapeutic point of view with several drug positions in the treatment algorithm.

According to the latest available data, globally, HCC ranks seventh in incidence and fourth in direct mortality from cancer (1). The incidence of HCC increases with age (exceptionally it occurs before 40 years and the median age at diagnosis in our midst is between 65-70 years), being more frequent in men than in women (2). The rate of incidence is higher in western and south-eastern Africa, where the main etiological factors are hepatitis B and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection.",

However, the Commission points out that the scope of the results is severely limited by: - The conduct of the open-label study when a double-blind study was possible, possibly inducing a measurement bias with respect to overall survival and the secondary hierarchical criteria of response to treatment; - The absence of robust quality of life data due to the open nature of the study and the lack of a pre-defined endpoint; - the partial crossover i.",

MEDICAL NEEDS Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common of the liver cancers (approximately 90%) 1 with an estimated incidence in France of approximately 9,600 new cases per year in 2018 2. This type of liver cancer develops most often on a renal cirrhosis (80% to 90% of cases) of various types (primary hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, diabetes mellitus). The prognosis of primary liver cancer remains one of the worst of all cancers with a 5-year survival rate of less than 15%.3 The management of HCC depends on the stage of the disease and the general condition of the patients4,5,6,7. Unlike other solid tumors, for which the therapeutic decision is made based on the TNM classification, there is no consensus prognostic classification for HCC7. Therefore, several classifications or scores have been proposed including the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 8 classification which has the advantage of enabling a prognosis stratification and proposing a treatment algorithm. When HCC is at an early stage (BC 0-A), patients are generally eligible for curative treatment by surgery, radiosurgery or transplantation. In case of failure, refractory disease or ineligibility for TACE, or in the presence of vascular invasion and/ or extrahepatic injury (advanced stage CLC), treatment with sorafenib is recommended in patients with preserved general condition (ECOG ≤ 2) and preserved hepatic function (Child-Pugh A). In adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (stage BCLC B or C) who have not received prior systemic therapy, the medical need is therefore considered to be partially met by sorafenib. However, there remains a medical need for better tolerated and/ or more effective treatments at this stage of the disease.",

The 1st amendment (6 January 2014) mainly consisted of additions and clarifications regarding certain selection criteria (pre-cancer treatment, concomitant treatment, etc.), the addition of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire as a secondary quality of life assessment criterion (with updated statistical analysis), and the modification of the follow-up time for overall survival (life expectancy 2 to 3 months). The following two amendments consisted in amendments and clarification regarding the events that were expected to occur in the analyses.

As these may mainly involve fatigue, bleeding and abdominal pain, most of the patients studied had a Child-Pugh stage liver failure, there are limited data on safety and tolerability in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Experience According to the Periodic Safety Update Report for the first half of 2007, 19,086 patients were treated during that period (8740 commercially and 10,346 in clinical trials). 1The term \" adverse reactions\" refers to complaints and symptoms regardless of cause. Clinical pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely with concomitant use of agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 (midazolam, dextromethorphan, omeprazole). It cannot be excluded that sorafenib increases the concentrations of co-administered P-gp substrates (such as digoxin), CYP2B6 (like bupropion, cyclophosphamide, efavirenz, metronidazole), CYP8C2 (like paclitaxel, amodiaquine, repaglinide), or CYP2C9 (like acetoacetylsalicylate). Conclusion: There is an interaction between the concomitant use of sorafenib and inducers of CYP3A4 activity. There are no data on the efficacy and adverse effects of Sorafenib in children and adolescents. 4.f. Ease of use The recommended dose of soferanib is 400 mg (2 tablets of 200 mg) 2 times a day.

For these patients, no other pharmaceutical treatment costs are available, so that the full cost of using sorabenib is no longer borne by the CHF. The recommended dose of sorafenib is 400 mg twice a day. Treatment should be continued for as long as the patient has medical benefit or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. The manufacturer estimates that the average duration of treatment is 5 months (155 days), based on the average length of treatment in studies with the use of the average dose of Sorafenib in place of 710 mg per day, which was also recorded in two clinical trials, where the cost of the dose was 800 mg. The average cost of treatment with sorafenib is € 135.43 per day (i. e. 1 prescription per month, including VAT, delivery charge and clawback) at a dose of 800 mg per day.",

In the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in whom intentionally curative treatment or (continuation of) locoregional or local palliative treatment is not possible or is not considered medically meaningful, sorafenib has a therapeutic added value. The CFH came to the following conclusions: Based on the limited literature available, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma for whom intentional curative treatment or (continuation of) locoregional or local survival therapy is not possible or considered medically unsuitable ( advanced hepatocellulose), had a longer survival if palliative effects were observed than in patients with advanced disease.

Cheung (020) 797 88 10 Subject Assessment of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma Dear Mr Klink, In your letter of 6 December 2007, you requested the Health Insurance Council (HIC) to assess whether Nexavar® (sorafenib) is interchangeable with a medicine included in the insured package. If not, you are requested to assess the therapeutic value of this medicine for the indication for which reimbursement has been requested. This medicine is included in Annex 1B of the health insurance regulation and is currently being assessed for the treatment of a new cancer, i. e. This review concerns a new indication, namely the use of sorafenib in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer). You have granted the manufacturer of the medicine Nexavar® an exemption for a pharmaco-economic study. The Pharmaceutical Aid Committee (CFH) of the CVZ has now completed the substantive review. The considerations herein are contained in the CFH Report 08/03 attached as an annex. On the basis of this opinion of CFH and administrative considerations, the CDC has adopted its opinion on Nexavir® (sorafenib) in hepatocell carcinomas. CVZ Opinion The CVZ recommends that you extend the detailed conditions for Nexaver® to Annex 2 of the Health Insurance Regulations. This extension covers a subgroup of patients with hepatotoxicity to sorafenil per year, 164 patients were enrolled in the Netherlands in 1989-2000 (more than one patient per year). Background In the Netherlands, during the period 1989-2000, 1964 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled (an average of 164 patients per year).

Safety outcome safety assessments included vital signs recording, laboratory haematological and biochemical testing, urinalysis, and electrocardiography. Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute. All patients who received at least one of the study drugs (lenvatinib or sorafenib) were evaluated. The statistical endpoint on overall survival was tested for first-inferiority and non-infectiousness by using sorbamazepine, after assuming a placebo-containing lower-than-normal dose of 1,08 mg/day, with no correlation to the placebo effect. The power of the study to demonstrate non-inferiority was approximately 97%; the power of this study to declare superiority of lenvatinib over sorafenib was approximately 82%.

The Committee emphasises that the number of events in this outcome was sufficient to draw conclusions from the study. The REFLECT study demonstrated superiority of lenvatinib compared to sorafenib in the outcomes of progression-free survival (median 7.4 versus 3.7 months, respectively, with a HR of 0.66 and a 95% CI of 0.57 to 0.77, p< 0.001) and response rate (24.1% versus 9.2%), OR 3.13 (95% CI 2.15 to 4.56, p < 0.001), however these results are not critical for this evaluation. There were no significant differences in most quality of life parameters. There was no significant increase in adverse events with Lenvatinib as compared to Sorafenib. This conclusion is based on the following:  REFLECT study which is an open-label, randomised, multinational, multi-centre, phase 3 non-inferiority comparative trial comparing lenvatinib to sorafenib in the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable HCC.  In the REFLECT study lenvitinib demonstrated no inferiority and did not demonstrate superiority compared to Sorafenib for the overall survival outcome, the critical outcome of this study. There was no demonstration of superiority in the quality of life outcome.  No significant comparative safety concerns were identified for lenvatinib. This conclusion is based on the following:  REFLECT Study which is an open-label, randomised, multinational, multi-centre, non-inferiority comparative trial that compared lenvatinib to sorafenib in the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable ORCC.  In the REFLET study, Lenvatinib demonstrated no inferiority and no superiority in comparison to Sorafenib for the monotherapy treatment of adult patients with advanced or unresettable CHC.",

It is the 6th most common worldwide, being responsible for a large number of deaths. HCCs occur in 90% of situations in a cirrhosis context, with the main risk factors in the Western world being hepatitis C virus infection and alcoholism. In the Eastern world there is a high prevalence of hepatitis B (which has been shown to have a direct oncogenic effect). In Portugal, for 2015 and based on the ROR-Sul data, it is estimated that about 360 new cases have been diagnosed nationally. The standardized rate for age (European standard population) is 4.26/100,000 and 0.26/100.000 respectively for men and women. Based on this Portuguese population of 10 million inhabitants, the number of new cases will be approximately 452 patients.

Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1.Data collection was performed on 27 August 2021, at which time the median follow-up was 33.2 months in the Stride arm and 32.2 months for the Sorafenib arms. See Figure 1 for Kaplan-Meier curves for OS and PFS. For the secondary efficacy endpoint PFS, the median was 3.8 months (95% CI 3.7-5.3) in the STRIDE arm compared to 4.1% (95% KI 3.8-5.5) in the sorafenib arm. PFS data were mature.

[6] Following the publication of the main article [6] from the HIMALAYA study, a subsequent data extraction has been carried out (on 23 January 2023). Based on this extraction, the company has presented a record in which primarily the OS was studied [8]. Figure 3 shows Kaplan-Meier curves for the OS from this data extract. Compared to the August 2021 data collection, in the January 2023 data collection the median value of the STRIDE and sorafenib OS was essentially unchanged, as well as the odds ratio and its confidence interval.

The health economics analysis that the company chose to do for STRIDE versus atezozizumab + bevazizumab is a cost comparison. A prerequisite for a cost-comparison to constitute a TLV health economic assessment is that it is reasonable to assume comparable efficacy for the treatment options. TLV assessment: Based on the company' s MAIC, TLV assesses that treatment with STRIDA is comparable to atezoizumab Plus bevavizumab for the overall survival effect measure. For PFS, the company ' s indirect comparisons suggest better outcomes for atezoazumab+ bevaxizumab. However, based on its cost-to-life comparison and the prevailing indirect uncertainty in the company comparison between STRIDEs and atezozumab, the TLV also assumes comparable effectiveness between TLVs for the PFS effect. Efficacy and safety of lenvatinib compared to sorafenib have been studied in the Phase III non-inferiority study REFLECT [10], which showed comparable efficacy between the alternatives for efficacy measures OS. The company has indirectly compared STRIDE with lenvatitinib with an anchored MAIC based on the HIMALAYA and REFLECT studies, both of which had Sorafenib as a comparator. For PFS, there were differences in its definition in HIMALAYA and REFLECT. The hazard ratio for PFS for STRIDE compared to sorafenib after adjustments for the HIMALYA population was [--]. This is to be compared with the hazard rate for lenvatinib compared to Sorafenib in REFLEECT which was 0.65 (95% CI 0.560.77). Based on this, the risk ratio was calculated as follows:",

The study shows that there is a difference in overall survival between patients treated with immunotherapies compared to chemotherapy for up to 60 months, and that the studies show support for long-term survival. TLV's clinical expert states that it is reasonable to expect that treatment with STRIDE in HCC may result in long survival for a proportion of patients.

The TLV clinical expert considers that the study design, where a second course of STRIDE was possible for some patients, could be a treatment option for isolated patients in Sweden. In Sweden, patients are treated first-line with sorafenib or lenvatinib if atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is not appropriate. However, according to the TLV Clinical Expert, an equivalent efficacy of sorefenib/lenvatinib is expected irrespective of patients' suitability for atezoizumab + bevaziumab. EMA considers that the adverse reactions of STRIDE are significant, but that relatively few patients discontinue treatment and that most of the side effects are clinically manageable. EMA is of the opinion that the side effect profile of ST RIDE is not significantly worse than that of sorafenib.[2] TLV's clinical expert considers STRITE's side effects were expected and that they do not differ significantly from other studies with combined immunotherapy. Furthermore, the expert believes that the Grade 3 and 4 adverse effects were comparable in STRIDEs and sorabenibs, and that it was positive that STRIDA did not cause side effects. Based on the Kaplan-Meier data from January 2023, TLV has noted that the efficacy of Sorafenib has been relatively underestimated.",
