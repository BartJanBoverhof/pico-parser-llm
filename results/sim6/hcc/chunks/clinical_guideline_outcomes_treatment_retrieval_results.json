These additional studies highlight the importance of the FGFR2 signalling pathway for a subset of cholangiocarcinomas with FGfr2 fusion or rearrangement (see also background to Recommendation 4.46). Due to the good response rates, a strong recommendation was made here at a Level of Evidence 3. In addition to the abovementioned studies, numerous other clinical data from the first group of substances have been obtained for futibatinib. In addition to fusion genes, activating mutations or inframe deletions have also been described as relevant for therapeutic approaches [768], [769].

Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer worldwide. According to current GLOBOCAN data, more than 905 000 people worldwide fell ill with a primary liver tumor (HCK and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) in 2020 and more than 830 000 died from it [http:\\\\gco.iarc.fr]. The most common risk factors for HCC in Germany are currently chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and alcohol consumption. The incidence of HCC has increased significantly in the Western world due to chronic HCV infection-related cirrhosis of the liver as well as the significant increase in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Hepatitis (NASH) with advanced fibrosis or cirrosis. Cohort studies have shown that approximately 1-8% of all patients with cirrhosis develop HCC (2% for HBV, 3-8% for HCV) [3], [4], [5] whereas in NAFLD or NASH the incidence of HCC varies greatly (0.004 - 7.6%) [6]. In NAFLD or NASH, on the other hand, the incidence of HCC varies greatly (0.004 - 7.6%) [6],[7].",

Retrospective analyses have shown that TACE outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival can be improved by further differentiating the indication within the criteria of BC BLC stage. In particular, the size and number of tumour cores and the severity of the dysfunction are of minor importance. The vascularisation of the tumour core plays an important role in the outcome of TACE. Pseudoencapsulation suggests better outcomes than in poorly vascularized and diffuse arterially supplied tumours. Tumor sites at the 'water gap' between arterial supply territories also present increased demands on the interventional treatment technique. This involves high quality intraprocedural imaging, possibly including cone beam CT under arterial perfusion to clarify selective vascularisation. The greater the selectivity of transarterial therapy and the more pronounced and comprehensive the devascularizing effect of the embolization measures, the better the efficacy of TACE and the lesser the side-effect.",

On the basis of this systematic research, no recommendation could be made due to the lack of available studies. o The recommendation for first-line therapy of gemcitabine/ cisplatin has been extended to include the combination with durvalumab. o Progress under first line therapy is recommended by presentation in the Molecular Tumor Board. o In second lines, more treatment options based on molecular changes are available: no oncology programme. o Hepatocellular carcinoma and biliary carcinomas. o Long-term survival. o August 4.0 ▪ Patients with microsatellite instability or mitochondrial repair insufficiency with progestogen inhibitor have been recommended as preclinical therapy in the preparation of immunotherapy (progress) with pemibrolizumab in patients with progressive renal failure.

A larger trial comparing arterial chemoembolization and radioactive Iodine 131 treat- ment did not show any difference in survival between the two groups. However,side effects were significantly lower in the group receiving radioactive Iodine 131treatment. Radioactive Iodine 131 treatment was also used in a adjuvant setting in patients resected for HCC without detectable residual disease. A longer delay of recurrence was observed in the treated group (70). Recommendations The use of radioactive Iodine 131 treatment can be used as an alternative for chemoembolization. 12. Treatment of early hepatocellular carcino- ma in patients on the waiting list for liver trans- plantation Liver transplantation is the therapy of choice for cir- rhotic patients with early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The optimal candidates for liver transplantation (single nodule < 5 cm or up to 3 nodules < 3 cm) achieve a 70% 5-year survival rate, with recurrence rate below 15% (59). The prognosis after transplantation is there- fore the same as for a similar underlying disease without HCC. However,these excellent results were obtained at a time when the average waiting time for liver trans- plantation was less than 6 months. But the tumour dou- bling time in asymptomatic HCC less than 5 cm was estimated to be around 4 months (71). Therefore, the delay between diagnosis and transplantation can allow the tumour to grow to stages that contraindicate trans- plantation.",

Chemoembolization is a common adjuvant treatment for patients on the waiting list. This option contributes to accurate staging of the intrahepatic disease and may achieve extensive tumor necrosis (76-80). The procedure is well tolerated in the majority of this subset of patients waiting for transplantation. Furthermore, it has been shown that the prevalence of hepatic arterial thrombosis, a graft-threatening complication of transplantation, was not increased in patients who underwent hepatic arterial chemoembolization before transplantation (76). It is probably the treatment of choice during the waiting list for patient with Child A cirrhosis when percutaneous injection is not feasible. If the waiting time before transplantation is expected to be shorter than 3 months,the interest of adjuvant ther- apies is probably clinically less relevant. If the waiting list exceeds seven months, a decision analysis has shown that living donor liver transplanta- tion is cost effective compared with cadaveric transplan- tation (66). Decision analysis has also shown that surgical resec- tion while waiting for transplantation for patients with single HCC and well preserved hepatic function pro- vides moderate gains in life expectancy and is cost effec- tive only if the waiting list exceeds one year (72).

These additional studies highlight the importance of the FGFR2 signalling pathway for a subset of cholangiocarcinomas with FGfr2 fusion or rearrangement (see also background to Recommendation 4.46). Due to the good response rates, a strong recommendation was made here at a Level of Evidence 3. In addition to the abovementioned studies, numerous other clinical data from the first group of substances have been obtained for futibatinib. In addition to fusion genes, activating mutations or inframe deletions have also been described as relevant for therapeutic approaches [768], [769].

Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer worldwide. According to current GLOBOCAN data, more than 905 000 people worldwide fell ill with a primary liver tumor (HCK and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) in 2020 and more than 830 000 died from it [http:\\\\gco.iarc.fr]. The most common risk factors for HCC in Germany are currently chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and alcohol consumption. The incidence of HCC has increased significantly in the Western world due to chronic HCV infection-related cirrhosis of the liver as well as the significant increase in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Hepatitis (NASH) with advanced fibrosis or cirrosis. Cohort studies have shown that approximately 1-8% of all patients with cirrhosis develop HCC (2% for HBV, 3-8% for HCV) [3], [4], [5] whereas in NAFLD or NASH the incidence of HCC varies greatly (0.004 - 7.6%) [6]. In NAFLD or NASH, on the other hand, the incidence of HCC varies greatly (0.004 - 7.6%) [6],[7].",

Retrospective analyses have shown that TACE outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival can be improved by further differentiating the indication within the criteria of BC BLC stage. In particular, the size and number of tumour cores and the severity of the dysfunction are of minor importance. The vascularisation of the tumour core plays an important role in the outcome of TACE. Pseudoencapsulation suggests better outcomes than in poorly vascularized and diffuse arterially supplied tumours. Tumor sites at the 'water gap' between arterial supply territories also present increased demands on the interventional treatment technique. This involves high quality intraprocedural imaging, possibly including cone beam CT under arterial perfusion to clarify selective vascularisation. The greater the selectivity of transarterial therapy and the more pronounced and comprehensive the devascularizing effect of the embolization measures, the better the efficacy of TACE and the lesser the side-effect.",

Stereotactic radiation therapy (SBRT) provides precise radiation to a well-defined target volume, usually with few fractions and a high dose per fraction. Phase I and Phase II studies of SBRT of HCC show that radiation treatment can be administered with low risk and limited side effects to patients with Child Pugh A, maximum tumour diameter of 5 cm and adequate liver volume (83). Several publications show that children with Child-Pugh B and C developed irreversible liver failure, which is why those with child Pugh scores > 7 are not recommended for stereotactic irradiation (84, 85).

Bilobary HCC can also be treated with resection, possibly in combination with RFA (64). The existence of distant metastases, thrombosis of the venae portae or vena cavae main stem are absolute contraindications to resection or other topical treatment. Liver resection for HCC is accompanied by a perioperative mortality of less than 5% and a morbidity of 30-40%, depending on the patient's liver function. Serious complications such as leukaemia, postoperative softening and gallbladder abscess constitute less than 5%. Note, however, that the incidence of complications and mortality is many times lower at the peripheral end of the tumour than during laparoscopy and should be taken into account, especially in patients who have undergone hepatic ablation in recent years. The 5-year survival after resection for HCC is 35-50% in newer large cohorts (66). The long-term survival for small solitary HCC < 5 cm in diameter is close to 70% (67, 68). The risk of recurrence during the first 5 years after radical resection of HCC, for example, is in the order of 50-80% (69). There is no evidence for adjuvant chemotherapy after liver resection (70). The most effective way of prolonging the survival of patients with re-resection, ablation and/ or transarteriolymbolisation (TACE) is shown to be regressive treatment with regressive re-section and ablation.",

The number of tumours should not be considered as an absolute contraindication to ablation if treatment of all tumour changes is achievable; normally it would be recommended that the BCLC criteria be followed, i.e. the number should be ≤ 3; best results are obtained when the tumour is less than 3 cm. The combination of ablation and chemoembolization may be used for larger tumours (78). In patients with small HCC < 3cm, RCTs show that percutaneous ablation is equivalent to resection in terms of local tumour control and long-term survival but with significantly lower complication rate and length of admission In recent estimates of overall survival after RFA, approximately 95%, 60% and 25-30% 1-, 5- and 10-year survival are found, and for patients within the Milan criteria, 1-year (8799%), 3-year (6087%) and 5-year (4274%) survival is indicated (80).",

HCC occurs in 70-80% of cases in a cirrhotic liver. Objectives The overall aim of the guideline is to support an evidence-based cancer intervention of high and uniform quality across Denmark. Patient group The most common cause of cirrhosis (about 65%) in Denmark is alcohol consumption (2). The incidence and prevalence of cirrosis is relatively stable, but the underlying causes are changing in these years as alcohol-related cirrhomosis and Hep B+C decline, while fat-related Cirrhomoses have an increasing trend. Diagnosis and treatment of HCC involve physicians from different specialties, including medics with internal hepatological expertise (hereinafter referred to as hepato-implantation surgeons), HP/transplantation surgists, oncologists, radiologists, and interventional pathologists. The hepatologist is therefore the central figure in the management of these patients. At any time, the hepatologist must be able to assess liver function and, on this basis, assess which treatment measures the patient will be able best to tolerate. The hepatologists must be responsible for the treatment of liver disease both before and after cancer therapy. Target group for the use of this guideline This guidelines aims primarily at supporting clinical work and the development of clinical quality, which is why it is the primary target group for clinical health professionals working in the Danish healthcare system. Screening for HCC is recommended in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C and demonstrated cirrhosis, as well as in those with cirrhotic hepatitis C eradicated.",

The Milan criteria or AFP criteria are not used in non-cirrhotic patients with HCC. If the tumours are not resectable and the patient does not exhibit extrahepatic metastasis, the patient should be assessed for hepato-transplantation (C) 15. The following is a summary of Recommendations for liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma: an international consensus conference report (71). Other recent key references (72, 73). Liver transplantation should be reserved for patients with 5-year survival comparable to that of non-HCC patients, i.e. approximately 70%. Prognosis is assessed primarily on the basis of the diameter of the largest tumour and the number of tumours in the liver. There must be no extrahepatic tumour. Microinvasion is a very poor prognostic sign and there is some correlation to tumour size and number as well as certain biomarkers; however, there are no reliable, either radiological or biomarker methods to detect microinvision, which is why microbial invasion is not yet included in the selection of liver transplants. However, if one could use multiple criteria to validate the prognosis of patients with micro-transplantation, we will be able to use a better prognosis for those patients with non-AFPs (see below). In non-cirrhotic patients, liver transplantation should be considered on a case-by-case basis as an alternative to resection if the tumour is confined to the liver, irrespective of its size and number.",

Recommendations are graded in 3 categories according to the level of evidence of data found in the literature.Results: The diagnosis and staging of HCC is essentially based on clinical, biological and imaging features. A pathological analysis obtained by a biopsy of tumoral and non-tumoral liver is rec- ommended. HCCs can be divided into 2 groups, taking into account not only the tumor stage, but also liver function. HCCs accessible to curative treatments are tumors that are in Milan criteria or with an AFP score ≤ 2, mainly treated by surgical resection, local ablation or liver transplantation. Intermediate and advanced HCCs with no liver insufﬁciency, accessible only to palliative treatments, beneﬁt from TACE, SIRT or systemic therapy according to the presence or absence of macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. Conclusion: Such recommendations are in permanent optimization and each individual case must be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert board.",

Several observational studies, including some Italian ones, have given results consistent with the Asian data, confirming that half-yearly surveillance4 (level of evidence 2++) is effective in cirrhotic patients (considered at risk for annual incidence of HCC at around 2-45.6%) (Class of Evidence 2++). Advanced age (over 70-75) is not in itself a reason not to recommend periodic monitoring, as it does not preclude subsequent treatment8 (Level of Evidence 2+). The addition of periodic alpha-fetoprotein dosing to ultrasound surveillance does not substantially increase (approximately 6%) the rate of recognition of HCC at an early stage and significantly worsens the cost-effectiveness of surveillance, increasing the number of false positives (Leval of Evidences 2+) However, monitoring of the semihyperfetoma may not reduce the patient's risk of hypersensitivity to monitoring, except in the absence of available instruments.

In patients with Child-Pugh B liver cirrhosis and multifocal B tumours, the APR may only be considered in very well selected cases. The prognosis of patients with HCC and Child-Pugh C liver cirrhosis is mainly dictated by the liver failure caused by the cirrhotic disease. Consequently, the only treatment for these patients is liver transplantation. When transplantation is not possible, patients with hCC and child-pugh C hepatic cirrosis should receive the best supportive therapy as any locoregional treatment will induce further liver failure, worsening the prognosis for such patients. For these patients there is no evidence of benefit from the application of systemic treatments. Several studies suggest that combined treatments (TACE + percutaneous ablation) increase tumour response to locoregional therapy, extending the volume of tumour necrosis achievable. The meta-analysis of four small randomised trials comparing single and combined treatment showed a survival advantage with the use of combined therapies61 (Level of evidence 1+).

A recent Cochrane systematic review concluded that there is no clear evidence of efficacy for any adjuvent approach.62 (Level of evidence 1+). Some meta-analyses have instead confirmed a survival benefit obtainable with antiviral therapy in viral patients, due to its favorable effect on disease progression and mortality not related to HCC (L63 (L1+) evidence). Patients undergoing surgical or percutaneous ablative treatment who have shown a complete response are recommended to undergo a low-contrast positive imaging method every three months for the first two years and every six months thereafter. Advanced HCC is characterized by the presence of portal vein thrombosis and/or metastasis. In these cases there is no indication for locoregional treatments as it is a systemic disease. Some highly specialized surgical centers have proposed and perform portal thrombectomy associated with hepatic resection of HCC, especially in cases where the portal invasion is limited to the branches of order II and III.

In cirrhotic patients with HCC limited to the liver and with good residual liver function, treatment should aim, where possible, at the eradication of the neoplasm. A first consideration should be whether the patient is eligible for a liver transplant as this procedure represents a cure for both HCC and the underlying cirrhosis. However, in practice, liver transplantation is applicable to a very small fraction of cirrotic HCC patients due to clinical and oncological limitations associated with organisational and social considerations. Therefore, given the limited availability of organs, the use of transplantation must be based on the concept of equity between the different categories of patients and cannot disregard the calculation of the benefit of survival provided to the individual patient with transplantation compared to the expected results with other possible anticancer treatments The best survival results (75-80% at 5 years) after liver transplantation for HCC on hepatic cirrhosis are in patients who meet the Milan criteria, i.e. a single neoplasm ≤ 5 cm or multiples of no more than 3 nodes and diameter ≤ 326 cm (Level 2++).",

This negative result was then confirmed by another French randomised study69 (EVIDENCE Level 1) and by the meta-analyses based on the systematic review of all studies conducted (EVEL 1+4).

Similarly, in an EORTC study, randomised, with factor design, involving 244 patients, no effect on survival was identified following treatment with antiandrogens (nilutamide) or analogues of LHRH (goserelin) or both70 (EVIDENCE Level 1+). Recommendation Strength Clinical recommendation SIGN clinical recommendations In patients with HCC, treatment with tamoxifen or strong androgenic anti-A negatives should not be undertaken. The use of chemotherapeutic agents in HCC patients, characterised by a high rate of marked impairment of more or less potent hepatic function, results in increased carcinogenicity associated with elevated risk of cancer, in addition to the intrinsically low toxicity of HCC-related carcinogens. In addition, HCC can be listed among cancers intrinsically characterized by less chemo-sensitivity. Numerous chemotherapeutic drugs, as single agents or in combination, have been experimented over the past decades in patients with HCC, producing more or less disappointing percentages of objective responses, without ever producing a solid demonstration of efficacy. Among the various cytotoxic drugs experimented and variously used in clinical practice, doxorubicin, used as a single agent, is reported.",

Recommendation Use for patients after treatment for HCC the following follow-up schedule: Months Serum AFp determination Perform CT/ MRI liver 6 X X including thorax 12 X X Including thurax 18 X X 24 X X including tharax Year 2-5 á 6 months X Xincluding thrax Consider in post-treatment follow up of HCC imaging of the liver alternately to be combined with a CT Thorax. 68 patients (45%) developed metastases at presentation at the time of HCC and 83 patients (55%) metastasized during follow-up with the largest proportion involving lung metastasis (47%) (Uka, 2007). Detection only for better survival The Health Council states in its report that early detection of new manifestations of cancer should be found only for gains in duration or quality of life (Health Council, 2007) Earlier detection is effective at an early stage rather than at a later stage if symptoms have arisen. Early detection should only be carried out in a programmatic approach. Depending on the literature of the HCC, and whether a small tumour needs to be treated locally or undergo a local reassessment, early treatment for HCC patients requires a translation to a local review. If primary HCC was accompanied by elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), AFP may be used in follow-up for hepatocellular carcinoma detection of recurrent disease. An example of a pre-follow-up is shown in Table 1.",

Recommendation Inform patients and family/neighbours about the possible emergence of complaints after treatment of HCC. Report these early consequences of cancer using a (validated) screening tool. This screening should be used from diagnosis to treatment and follow-up. Considerations Disease and treatment have major consequences The Health Council concludes that many patients, after intentional curative treatment for cancer, suffer from complaints (Health Council, 2007). These complaints may be limited or extensive, both physical and psychological in nature, and may occur early or later. This is called distress. By distress is meant: an unpleasant emotional experience of a psychological (cognitive, behavioural, emotional), social and/or spiritual nature that may interfere with the ability to effectively cope with cancer, the accompanying physical symptoms and treatment (Guideline on detecting the need for psychosocial care, 2017). These are mostly physical consequences that are clearly linked to the specific nature of the cancer, consequences of the treatment, psychsocial problems and general complaints.

Examples of questionnaires are the EORTC QLQ-30 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire) and the FACT-G (Functional Assessment of cancer Therapy-General), both of which have disease-specific modules for HCC to assess specific symptoms. The disease-Specific Modules of HCC are EorTC QlQ-HCC18 and FACt-Hep [427-429]. Regular measurements can be very helpful in guiding healthcare staff to evaluate treatments, to individualize care and to enable the measurement and management of symptoms. Results from the measures can help healthcare personnel to get a picture of which symptoms are affecting the patient and can provide a more effective measure of the degree of persistence of symptoms based on the use of the NRS Symptomatic Rating Scale (Symptomatic Validation Instrument) [430]. The majority of symptoms can be graded on the NRS (Numeric Rating Scale) 010. Cancer-related fatigue is defined as an abnormal fatigue a stressful, persistent, subjective feeling of physical, mental, emotional, and cognitive fatigue or exhaustion. Many patients describe this fatigue as a total lack of energy that makes itself felt even without exertion. Fatigue is unrelated to activities performed and affects daily life [432, 433].

Due to positive results from studies with immunotherapy combination in palliative HCC, the possibility of pre-operative systemic therapy is also being studied. Evidence is currently limited to minor and II studies with few patients included and therefore not recommended in routine care [354, 355]. Treatment with neoadjuvant systemic oncology therapy is not recommended within the framework of clinical trials. The risk of recurrence following curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively high, with approximately 70% of recurrences occurring within 5 years of surgery [77]. The risk factors for recurrence are tumour size > 5cm, multiple tumours in the liver, vascular invasion and low differentiation [356]. A number of essential venous diseases have been studied, but no studies exist at present to support a therapeutic indication. Systemic therapy should be offered to patients with good functional status (WHO PS 0-1) with good hepatic function (Child Pugh A). For patients with more marginal liver function (child B7) there is no absolute limit, but individual assessment should be made. Clinical ascites or encephalopathy are contraindications, as well as elevated bilirubin above about 50, while albumin levels, which can be influenced by many factors, are of minor importance. Diagnosis of possible portal hypertension and especially treatment of varicose veins in the esophagus should precede the start of systemic therapy, see section 8.4.2 Liver function evaluation and 13.1 Cirrhosis complications.",

Diagnosis and treatment of portal hypertension and cirrhosis complications should be viewed and conducted in the perspective of the individual patient's entire disease. When diagnosed with HCC, 70 to 80% of patients have cirrhotic liver disease, which is not infrequently unknown and compensated, where HCC may be the first symptom of a previously unknown cirrosis. Patients should undergo standardised examination to clarify the genesis of liver disease. Some conditions are treatable and adequate management of these conditions may improve the prognosis of HCC. The diagnosis can be based on clinical evaluation, combined with radiography, biology, and endoscopic findings. It is important to realize that there are situations in which radiology cannot confirm or exclude the presence of liver cirrhosis! Compensated cirrho­sis has a relatively good prognosis, the 10-year survival rate is about 80%.",

According to data from SweLiv, > 2/3 of all patients diagnosed with HCC in Sweden between 2012 and 2022 had underlying liver disease. the actual rate of underlying liver cirrhosis among patients with HCC is thus higher than previously reported.[2] Similarly, MASLD is an increasing and often underestimated cause of HCC in Sweden [17]. Underlying MASLD should always be suspected in patients with hCC who do not have other known predisposing liver diseases, but who also have type 2 diabetes and/or obesity, especially in association with other metabolic co-morbidities such as hypertension, high blood lipids or coronary artery disease [7].",

Radiological methods are important for early documentation of objective signs of treatment response that correlate with survival. A disadvantage of the standard method RECIST in HCC is that there are effective treatments, such as some locoregional modalities and targeted drugs, that do not affect the size of tumors and where the clinical effect of treatment is therefore not captured [175]. The problem of the absence of tumor shrinkage was addressed with the introduction of the concept of viabletumor in the modified RECISTM criteria (mRECIST) [176]. Tumor viability is defined radiologically as the remaining contrast-suppressing area in the tumor I. Instead of measuring the maximum length of the tumor according to the MRCIST 1.1 method, the maximum diameter of the longest diametrical remaining area (MRCIST) or the maximum time remaining in the intermediate stage (TACRISTM) in the region after complete non-absorption or contraception of the HCC (T) is measured by TACRIST 1. However, several studies have shown that response (=ORR, overall response rate) after locoregional treatment as measured by mRECIST predicts survival (OS) [177]. The first control with DT or MRI is usually done after 1 3 months [178]. mRICIST is also used in studies of systemic treatment of HCC. However, at advanced HCC, international guidelines recommend both mRECTIST and conventional RECIST [179]. post-treatment response in LR-TR viable (definitely or probably viable), LR- TR equivocal (oclar viability) and LR-RT nonviable. LR-Tr viable is defined as nodular, expansive or thick, irregular tissue with any of: • arterial phase recharge • washout • contrast recharge similar to that before treatment. Expected patterns of contra-recharge after treatment, such as thin recharge in the periphery of the lesion after embolization, should be characterised as LR-T R non viable.",

Transarterial therapies (see section 11.5 Transartery Locoregional Therapy) presuppose, as do curative treatments, that the tumour burden is confined to the liver, but may be given in multifocal tumour disease. Transarteral treatments are not considered to be curative treatment alone, even if a complete response can be achieved. However, transartery therapy may also be used for the purpose of tumour suppression pending liver transplantation or first downging. Systemic oncological therapy (see Section 11.6 Systemic treatment) may be used in advanced HCC, such as metastasis or malignancy, taking into account overall cardiac function, liver disease and co-morbidity. In addition, there are some limitations with regard to portal thrombosis. Ablation is considered a potentially curative treatment and requires a smaller tumor, limited to the liver, adequate liver function, and technical conditions to perform the ablation without harming nearby structures. Ablation provides an equivalent survival rate and is associated with fewer complications, shorter care time, and less resource availability than resection [227-229]. Local treatment minimizes the volume of healthy liver that is removed. The disadvantages are that the risk of incomplete tumor destruction and local recurrence is higher than for central resection. There is a limitation in large tumors that can be treated with marginal water (3 cm is a common limit). Gallus gallus tumors may be treated adequately but with increased risk of recurrence.",
