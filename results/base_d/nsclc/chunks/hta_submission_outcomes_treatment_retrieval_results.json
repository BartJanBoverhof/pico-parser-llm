There are several approved treatments targeting specific driver mutations in NSCLC that have improved patient survival significantly compared with non-targeted treatments for patients with an actionable mutation(1). However, currently, no approved treatment is available that specifically targets the KRAS G12C driver mutation in NSCLC. Standard of care treatment for KRAS G12C mutated NSCLC is currently the same as for patients with nontargetable mutations. This includes PD-(L)1 inhibitors (with or without platinum chemotherapy) for first-line (1L)\ntreatment of advanced NSCLC.",

However, it explained that it could have been possible to select KRAS G12C mutation data from SELECT-1 data. The ERG considered that the company's supplementary analysis using a PSWA may be less biased than the MAIC. It explained that the Amgen Flatiron Health real-world evidence data was adjusted to make it more comparable to the CodeBreaK100 population, and that there was little difference in the effective sample size compared with the MAIC. It also noted that the PSWA was adjusted for 13 covariates including brain metastases. However, the ERG highlighted that there remains considerable uncertainty in this approach.",

Sotorasib is a targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation. Sotorasib has only been indirectly compared with current treatment. The results suggest\nthat, after platinum-based chemotherapy, sotorasib increases the time before the cancer gets worse and how long people live compared with current treatment. Sotorasib likely meets NICE's criteria to be a life-extending treatment at the end of life. But\nthere is uncertainty in the clinical evidence. Sotorasib has the potential to be cost\neffective, but more evidence is needed to address the uncertainties before it can be recommended for routine use. The evidence on sotorasib is promising. But, more data is being collected from the primary\nclinical trial and from an ongoing randomised controlled trial comparing sotorasib with docetaxel. Collecting additional data through the Cancer Drugs Fund may resolve some\nuncertainty in the clinical evidence. So, sotorasib is recommended for use in the Cancer\nDrugs Fund. © NICE 2024.

In NSCLC, there are several different molecular changes that drive the growth of cancer cells. One of these changes is the KRAS g12c mutation. The company states that docetaxel monotherapy is a relevant comparative alternative to Lumykra monotherapies in adult patients with advanced NSCLC with a KRAS G12C mutation, following progression from at least one prior line of systemic therapy, and justifies this as follows: according to clinical expertise referenced by the company, the majority of patients receive pemetrexed in the first line of therapy; since re-treatment with the same medicinal product is not recommended, docetaxal is the remaining treatment option for most patients with tumour progression.
