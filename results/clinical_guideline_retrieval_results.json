Therefore, according to the individual treatment situation, therapy modifications should be possible for the benefit of the patient. Strong consensus background In the treatment of lung cancer, there is an increasing degree of individualisation due to new therapeutic options. Thus, each patient with newly diagnosed lung cancer should be presented in a thoracic oncology tumor board. Decisions in the thoracial oncological tumor board should be guided by the current guidelines. However, after careful reasoning and documentation, under certain conditions, different treatment decisions can be made.",

Sotorasib is a targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation. Sotorasib has only been indirectly compared with current treatment. The results suggest\nthat, after platinum-based chemotherapy, sotorasib increases the time before the cancer gets worse and how long people live compared with current treatment. Sotorasib likely meets NICE's criteria to be a life-extending treatment at the end of life. But\nthere is uncertainty in the clinical evidence. Sotorasib has the potential to be cost\neffective, but more evidence is needed to address the uncertainties before it can be recommended for routine use. The evidence on sotorasib is promising. But, more data is being collected from the primary\nclinical trial and from an ongoing randomised controlled trial comparing sotorasib with docetaxel.

However, curative outcomes can be achieved in 10-20% of cases with limited disease. A summary assessment of nine randomised trials examining the duration of SCLC treatment does not support longer primary treatment than four cycles [302]. Longer treatment is likely to provide more evidence of toxicity without gains in survival or quality of life. However, studies have shown that survival after chemotherapy is important and the patient's response to immunotherapy (immunotherapy) has decreased, and no medications are currently recommended to improve the overall outcome in patients with SCLC.",
