However, it is essential to perform a new genetic profiling of progressive resistant metastases (alternative cDNA) to map the variants (21, 91) [a, 2b) ] of Lorentinib in order to overcome the frequencies at which ALKTI variants were developed during the 1st generation ALK. On-target resistance mechanisms developed under lorlatinib are often characterised by the presence of several different mutations (compound variants) in the ALK gene (most commonly G1202R + L1196M and G1203R + F1174C/ L), presumably as a result of sequential treatment with ALK-TKI. Multiple off-target resistance mechanisms that activate ALK-independent signaling pathways have been described during ALK TKI. There are case reports describing response by adding crizotinib to continued lorlatinib at acquired MET amplification (21, 89) [1a, 2b]. More studies investigating the effect of combined TKI are on the way. TKI combinations may, pending further evidence, not be recommended outside of clinical trials. Histological transformation Histologic transformation to small cell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinoma has been described under treatment with both lorlat, alectinib, and brigatinib, although it is rarely seen.

Sotorasib is a targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation. Sotorasib has only been indirectly compared with current treatment. The results suggest\nthat, after platinum-based chemotherapy, sotorasib increases the time before the cancer gets worse and how long people live compared with current treatment. Sotorasib likely meets NICE's criteria to be a life-extending treatment at the end of life. But\nthere is uncertainty in the clinical evidence. Sotorasib has the potential to be cost\neffective, but more evidence is needed to address the uncertainties before it can be recommended for routine use. The evidence on sotorasib is promising. But, more data is being collected from the primary\nclinical trial and from an ongoing randomised controlled trial comparing sotorasib with docetaxel. Collecting additional data through the Cancer Drugs Fund may resolve some\nuncertainty in the clinical evidence. So, sotorasib is recommended for use in the Cancer\nDrugs Fund. © NICE 2024.

It is recommended to treat the subgroup of patients with PD- L1≥50% with a smoking history with single-agent ICI in the first-line and with ChT (platinum doublet) in the second line. Onderbouwing: For patients with disease progression after combination ChT and ICI, the recommendations for subsequent treatment are not clear and there is uncertainty about level of evidence for these recommendations.
