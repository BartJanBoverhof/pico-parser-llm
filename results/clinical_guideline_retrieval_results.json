In 2022, sotorasib was approved for this indication in patients with advanced NSCLC that had progressed after previous systemic therapy. The indication is based on a Phase II study (CodeBreaK100) that included 124 evaluable patients with Advanced NSCLL and detected KRAS G12 C mutation, who had previously received treatment with immunotherapies and/ or platinum-based mediastatic cytostatics [256]. The results showed a survival advantage for patients receiving sotorasib in terms of prolonged PFS (HR 0.66 [0.510.86]; p=0.0017).",
