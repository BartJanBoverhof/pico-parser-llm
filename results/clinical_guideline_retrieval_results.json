Therefore, according to the individual treatment situation, therapy modifications should be possible for the benefit of the patient. Strong consensus background In the treatment of lung cancer, there is an increasing degree of individualisation due to new therapeutic options. Thus, each patient with newly diagnosed lung cancer should be presented in a thoracic oncology tumor board. Decisions in the thoracial oncological tumor board should be guided by the current guidelines. However, after careful reasoning and documentation, under certain conditions, different treatment decisions can be made.",

For CNS metastatic ROS-1+ NSCLC, entrectinib should be offered. nce [1175], [1176), [1177], [1278], [1379], [1480] Strong consensus background Three prospective studies demonstrate the high efficacy of Crizotinib in patients with advanced ROS1-fusion-gene-positive NCSC. In a prospective European Phase II study of 34 ROS1 positive patients, the ORR was 70% (95% CI: 5185) and the median PFS was 20.0 months (95%CI: 10.1n.e.) also with good tolerability [1179]. In a retrospective ORR analysis of 29 European ROS+1 positive NSCLC patients treated with Crizotinib, an ORR of 80% and a median DFS of only 9.78% had been observed for 87 months [1111]. As of May 2020, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor entrectinib is also approved for the first-line treatment of ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC.",

Elderly patients TKI treatment with entrectinib and larotrectnib has shown efficacy independently of age and is rarely tolerated in elderly patients.

However, it is essential to perform a new genetic profiling of progressive resistant metastases (alternative cDNA) to map the variants (21, 91) [a, 2b) ] of Lorentinib in order to overcome the frequencies at which ALKTI variants were developed during the 1st generation ALK. On-target resistance mechanisms developed under lorlatinib are often characterised by the presence of several different mutations (compound variants) in the ALK gene (most commonly G1202R + L1196M and G1203R + F1174C/ L), presumably as a result of sequential treatment with ALK-TKI. Multiple off-target resistance mechanisms that activate ALK-independent signaling pathways have been described during ALK TKI. There are case reports describing response by adding crizotinib to continued lorlatinib at acquired MET amplification (21, 89) [1a, 2b]. More studies investigating the effect of combined TKI are on the way. TKI combinations may, pending further evidence, not be recommended outside of clinical trials. Histological transformation Histologic transformation to small cell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinoma has been described under treatment with both lorlat, alectinib, and brigatinib, although it is rarely seen.

The molecular characterisation of the tumour has thus become a decisive criterion in the choice of therapeutic strategy. It allows the prescription of a number of treatments to be restricted to only those patients who are likely to benefit from them, thereby reducing the number of unnecessary, toxic and costly treatments. Since then, erlohnib, afahnib, osimerhnib and dacomihnib have also received MAs for this indication. In addition, osimarhnib can now be prescribed as an adjuvant after complete tumour resection for patients with IBIA-IIIA acquired EGFR mutagenicity, after adjunctive chemotherapy when indicated. Other types of predictive biomarkers of response to targeted therapies are also being introduced into clinical practice in the CBNPC for the prescription of targeted therapy, such as fusions involving ALK1 genes and ROS1.",

Targeted therapy for EGFR mutation and immunotherapy for high PD-L1 expression (and absence of EGFR Mutation and ALK fusion) are used in addition adjuvantly after surgery, therefore molecular pathological testing is relevant even at an early stage. There is scientific evidence and clinical experience of detecting molecular genetic changes on both cytological and histological material, while the basis is still somewhat limited for immunohistory for PD- L1 on cytology. Localization of predictive assays (both immunoassay and FISH sequencing) is recommended for cytology processing as the material may differ between sections and may affect its quality.

A summary assessment of nine randomised trials examining the duration of SCLC treatment does not support longer primary treatment than four cycles [302].
