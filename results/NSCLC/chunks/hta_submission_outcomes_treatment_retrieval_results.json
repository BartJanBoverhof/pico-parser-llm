There are several approved treatments targeting specific driver mutations in NSCLC that have improved patient survival significantly compared with non-targeted treatments for patients with an actionable mutation(1). However, currently, no approved treatment is available that specifically targets the KRAS G12C driver mutation in NSCLC. Standard of care treatment for KRAS G12C mutated NSCLC is currently the same as for patients with nontargetable mutations. This includes PD-(L)1 inhibitors (with or without platinum chemotherapy) for first-line (1L)\ntreatment of advanced NSCLC.",

Outcomes data for patients specifically with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC are limited. The systematic literature\nreviews described in Appendix A sought to identify clinical trials of therapies conducted in patients with KRASmutant NSCLC, and identified only one RCT (SELECT-1) that provided sufficient PFS and OS data for docetaxel monotherapy (the primary comparator) in a population of patients with KRAS-mutated NSCLC (including G12C\nand non-G12C mutations) (127). Several published observational studies in Western (European, Australian and US) populations show that survival in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC is similarly poor as that in patients with other KRAS mutations or\nwild type disease who are not eligible for existing targeted therapies (72, 128, 129).",

The current therapeutic management of the CRNPC is identical whether or not patients have a KRAS mutation (including G12 C). At the metastatic stage (IV), it is recommended that second-line therapy be offered systematically, whether patients have responded to a first-line metastasis or not. The nature of this treatment depends on the molecules previously used, the ECOG score and the histology: - Patients treated with immunotherapy monotherapy in the first line: chemotherapy based on platinum salts, such as in the 1st line: cisplatin-vinorelbine, cisplatine-citagembine, carboplatin-paclitaxel, cisplain-docetaxel, Cisplatin -pemetrexed (non-epidermoid only); - patients treated with chemotherapeutic therapy + immunotherapies in the line 1: chemotherapists in the single line: pemetrexed, docetaxel (non -epidermoside only). + first-line chemotherapy : monotherapy: docetaxel, pemetrexed (non-epidermoid only) A combination of paclitaxel + bevacizumab may also be proposed; - patients receiving first line bi-chemotherapy, without immunotherapy.: in the absence of a contraindication, immunotherapeutic treatment is the reference: atezolizumab, nivolumab or pembrolizimab (if PD-L1 ≥ 1%), with no hierarchy between these different treatments.",

The costs of the treatment are estimated in the currency of your country, and the health effects are most often expressed in years of life gained (LYG) or quality adjusted life years (QALY) as a result of using the treatment. A comparison of the cost and effect values associated with using the new treatment and their comparison with the cost/benefit values of existing treatments is used to answer the question of whether the health benefit achieved by the individual patient with the new therapy is higher than the cost of the reimbursable treatment. The results of the health cost-effects index are compared with the so-called profitability threshold, i.e. a result that signals that, given the resources of our country (expressed in GDP), the maximum cost of a new therapy, which is expected to be associated with obtaining an individual health effect (1 LYG or 1 QALY) compared to existing therapies, should not exceed three times the GDP per capita. Currently, the cost-efficiency level is PLN 175 926/QALY (PLN 3 58 x 642).",

It is currently the only inhibitor of Kras G12c approved by the European Medicines Agency, at a dosage of 960 mg/day PO, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. As the biology of lung cancer has become known, new drugs have been developed that act on specific components of the cancer. These drugs are called biologic or targeted therapeutics. These mutations initiate the oncogenic process and activate signaling pathways that the tumour needs to survive. Blocking this signaling can induce apoptosis and tumour regression. This is the framework for the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced CPNPC with mutated KRAS G12C, oral therapeutics and with the possibility of sequential use after chemotherapy or immunotherapy. In case of progression, the second line of treatment for advanced cPNPC consists of docetaxel monotherapy, or with pemetrex or docetaxil + nitendanib combination, or PD-L1 inhibitors such as nivolumab, pembrozolizumab or pentotubes, followed by discontinuous tubulination of the tubule, which reduces the activity of docopib, and a decrease in its activity of an anti-tubulin agent, which is a reducing agent in the circulatory system.

Docetaxel or other chemotherapy is not always judged as medically appropriate. This may be, for example, in case of poor general condition, significant adverse reactions to previous chemotherapies, or insufficient or short-term disease control with previous therapy. There are no specific treatment recommendations for the more limited patient population. Once all treatment options have been exhausted, generally the best supportive treatment remains for these patients. The relative efficacy between Lumicras and docetaxel is considered to be overestimated and should be reviewed: the overall assessment of TLV based on clinical data is adjusted to reflect the overestimation of the clinical trial data and the analysis should be compared with the over-estimation from the previous health registry (docetaxel 141/ 202) which was assessed to have exceeded the survival rate. A direct comparative study between Lumykras and docetaxel has subsequently been published, in which the efficacy and safety of sotorasib compared to docetaxil in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced NSCLC following progression on prior platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy has been evaluated in an open-label, randomised Phase III study, CodeBreaK 200.",

However, the high cost per gain QALY is not affected to such an extent in poor survival as a result of patients not eligible for Docetaxel being in poor condition. These latter factors affect the cost per QALY downwards. None of the TLV' s calculations of the cost-effectiveness of Lumykras compared to best supportive care result in a cost per earned QALy higher than what TLV would normally assess as reasonable for a very high severity condition. Patients already continuing treatment with Lumykra are covered by the benefit of the limitation of patients not needing to discontinue a treatment interrupting the function of a TLV assessed in patients already continued treatment with subsidised Lumykrac on 1 June 2024.",
