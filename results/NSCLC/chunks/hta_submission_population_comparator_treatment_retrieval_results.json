Nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab each lead to a significant prolongation in overall survival compared with docetaxel and also to a significant reduction in side effects. Accordingly, the guidelines regularly prefer immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. However, PD-L1 negative tumours are a fundamental exception. In these cases, the guidelines predominantly do not recommend a regular preference of immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, in PD-L1 negative tumours, alternative cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are also determined as an appropriate comparator therapy for the immune checkpoint inhibitors.

The risk of bias of the results for the endpoint of overall survival is rated as high. This is justified\nby the high percentage of patients who switch from the docetaxel arm to the sotorasib arm during the course of the study and due to the unclear percentage of censoring at the start of\nthe study. At the endpoint level of the endpoint category of side effects and for the endpoint of health status, the risk of bias is classified as high due to the differential percentages of patients\nincluded in the evaluations between the treatment arms. For the endpoints of health status, discontinuation due to AEs, non-severe and non-serious specific AEs, the lack of blinding additionally contributes to the high risk of bias of the results.

Patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC are therefore\nmanaged in the same way as those without an actionable mutation. In line with the current treatment guidelines from the DLCG (6), clinical experts (2, 3) confirmed that an increasing majority of patients in Denmark with NSCLC without currently actionable mutations now receive anti-\nPD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy or as monotherapy in the firstline of therapy.

It is currently the only inhibitor of Kras G12c approved by the European Medicines Agency, at a dosage of 960 mg/day PO, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. As the biology of lung cancer has become known, new drugs have been developed that act on specific components of the cancer. These drugs are called biologic or targeted therapeutics. These mutations initiate the oncogenic process and activate signaling pathways that the tumour needs to survive. Blocking this signaling can induce apoptosis and tumour regression. This is the framework for the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced CPNPC with mutated KRAS G12C, oral therapeutics and with the possibility of sequential use after chemotherapy or immunotherapy. In case of progression, the second line of treatment for advanced cPNPC consists of docetaxel monotherapy, or with pemetrex or docetaxil + nitendanib combination, or PD-L1 inhibitors such as nivolumab, pembrozolizumab or pentotubes, followed by discontinuous tubulination of the tubule, which reduces the activity of docopib, and a decrease in its activity of an anti-tubulin agent, which is a reducing agent in the circulatory system. Dosage: 75 mg/m2 IV, 21/21 days; up to disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.",

Thus, the systematic review only yielded data allowing indirect comparison of Sotorasib with docetaxel, and this analysis was performed using non-anchored MAICs. In terms of comparative efficacy, the indirect comparative data based on the MAIC methodology provided suggest that sotorasib is associated with a 39% reduction in risk of death (HR=0.611; 95% CI 0.451-0.829) and an extension in median survival time of 7.2 months; and a 56%",

Docetaxel or other chemotherapy is not always judged as medically appropriate. This may be, for example, in case of poor general condition, significant adverse reactions to previous chemotherapies, or insufficient or short-term disease control with previous therapy. There are no specific treatment recommendations for the more limited patient population. Once all treatment options have been exhausted, generally the best supportive treatment remains for these patients. The relative efficacy between Lumicras and docetaxel is considered to be overestimated and should be reviewed: the overall assessment of TLV based on clinical data is adjusted to reflect the overestimation of the clinical trial data and the analysis should be compared with the over-estimation from the previous health registry (docetaxel 141/ 202) which was assessed to have exceeded the survival rate. A direct comparative study between Lumykras and docetaxel has subsequently been published, in which the efficacy and safety of sotorasib compared to docetaxil in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced NSCLC following progression on prior platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy has been evaluated in an open-label, randomised Phase III study, CodeBreaK 200.",

According to results from the indirect comparison, patients treated with sotorasib have a decreased risk of disease progression and death compared to those included in the best supportive care. However, the Health Economics Analysis of the current patient population assumes that the TLV of sotorase has a better outcome than the best supporting treatment. Overall, the TLV assesses that the cost per QALY achieved for Lumykras is below the level TLV would normally assess as reasonable for a very high severity condition in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the KRAS G12C mutation who have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy and who have been treated with docetaxel or who are not medically suitable for treatment with Docetaxel. In a sensitivity analysis, the company shortens median OS in the Lumykras arm by one month and also shortens survival in the best supportive care arms to a small extent.",

When comparing a prospective study with study data and a retrospective analysis of registry data, differences in parameters such as patient characteristics and data availability are unavoidable, affecting comparability and increasing uncertainty. TLV notes that existing registries data for docetaxel do not exclusively include data for Docetaxel, which makes it difficult to generalize the effect. The costs of using Lumykras are not considered to be reasonable in relation to the benefit of treatment for the patients covered by the current high overall TLV estimates that the cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained exceeds the level that TLV usually assesses reasonably at the very low severity of the condition for a population of approximately 200 patients covered in the current health benefit analysis (APA 48). In the comparison between Lumykras and docetaxel, the company has revised the health economic analysis from the previous grant application (No 141/2022).",
