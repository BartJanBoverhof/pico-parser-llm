Retrospective analyses have shown that TACE outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival can be improved by further differentiating the indication within the criteria of BC BLC stage. In particular, the size and number of tumour cores and the severity of the dysfunction are of minor importance. The vascularisation of the tumour core plays an important role in the outcome of TACE. Pseudoencapsulation suggests better outcomes than in poorly vascularized and diffuse arterially supplied tumours. Tumor sites at the 'water gap' between arterial supply territories also present increased demands on the interventional treatment technique. This involves high quality intraprocedural imaging, possibly including cone beam CT under arterial perfusion to clarify selective vascularisation. The greater the selectivity of transarterial therapy and the more pronounced and comprehensive the devascularizing effect of the embolization measures, the better the efficacy of TACE and the lesser the side-effect.",

Retrospective analyses have shown that TACE outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival can be improved by further differentiating the indication within the criteria of BC BLC stage. In particular, the size and number of tumour cores and the severity of the dysfunction are of minor importance. The vascularisation of the tumour core plays an important role in the outcome of TACE. Pseudoencapsulation suggests better outcomes than in poorly vascularized and diffuse arterially supplied tumours. Tumor sites at the 'water gap' between arterial supply territories also present increased demands on the interventional treatment technique. This involves high quality intraprocedural imaging, possibly including cone beam CT under arterial perfusion to clarify selective vascularisation. The greater the selectivity of transarterial therapy and the more pronounced and comprehensive the devascularizing effect of the embolization measures, the better the efficacy of TACE and the lesser the side-effect.",

Other recent key references (72, 73). Liver transplantation should be reserved for patients with 5-year survival comparable to that of non-HCC patients, i.e. approximately 70%. Prognosis is assessed primarily on the basis of the diameter of the largest tumour and the number of tumours in the liver. There must be no extrahepatic tumour. Microinvasion is a very poor prognostic sign and there is some correlation to tumour size and number as well as certain biomarkers; however, there are no reliable, either radiological or biomarker methods to detect microinvision, which is why microbial invasion is not yet included in the selection of liver transplants. However, if one could use multiple criteria to validate the prognosis of patients with micro-transplantation, we will be able to use a better prognosis for those patients with non-AFPs (see below).",

Surveillance with abdominal ultrasound should be offered to individuals at high risk for developing HCC. Accurate diagnosis, staging, and liver function are crucial when determining the optimal therapeutic approach. The BCLC staging system is widely endorsed in Western countries. Managing this pathology requires a multidisciplinary, personalized approach, generally with a multimodal strategy. Surgery remains the only curative option, albeit local and systemic therapy may also increase survival when surgery is not suitable.

Recommendations are graded in 3 categories according to the level of evidence of data found in the literature.Results: The diagnosis and staging of HCC is essentially based on clinical, biological and imaging features. A pathological analysis obtained by a biopsy of tumoral and non-tumoral liver is rec- ommended. HCCs can be divided into 2 groups, taking into account not only the tumor stage, but also liver function. HCCs accessible to curative treatments are tumors that are in Milan criteria or with an AFP score ≤ 2, mainly treated by surgical resection, local ablation or liver transplantation. Intermediate and advanced HCCs with no liver insufﬁciency, accessible only to palliative treatments, beneﬁt from TACE, SIRT or systemic therapy according to the presence or absence of macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. Conclusion: Such recommendations are in permanent optimization and each individual case must be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert board.",

Several observational studies, including some Italian ones, have given results consistent with the Asian data, confirming that half-yearly surveillance4 (level of evidence 2++) is effective in cirrhotic patients (considered at risk for annual incidence of HCC at around 2-45.6%) (Class of Evidence 2++). Advanced age (over 70-75) is not in itself a reason not to recommend periodic monitoring, as it does not preclude subsequent treatment8 (Level of Evidence 2+). The addition of periodic alpha-fetoprotein dosing to ultrasound surveillance does not substantially increase (approximately 6%) the rate of recognition of HCC at an early stage and significantly worsens the cost-effectiveness of surveillance, increasing the number of false positives (Leval of Evidences 2+) However, monitoring of the semihyperfetoma may not reduce the patient's risk of hypersensitivity to monitoring, except in the absence of available instruments. However, it remains an indicator of the risk of developing HCC and should be dosed at the time of detection of a focal liver lesion on cirrhosis to contribute to the diagnostic and prognostic framework.",

Recommendation Inform patients and family/neighbours about the possible emergence of complaints after treatment of HCC. Report these early consequences of cancer using a (validated) screening tool. This screening should be used from diagnosis to treatment and follow-up. Considerations Disease and treatment have major consequences The Health Council concludes that many patients, after intentional curative treatment for cancer, suffer from complaints (Health Council, 2007). These complaints may be limited or extensive, both physical and psychological in nature, and may occur early or later. This is called distress. By distress is meant: an unpleasant emotional experience of a psychological (cognitive, behavioural, emotional), social and/or spiritual nature that may interfere with the ability to effectively cope with cancer, the accompanying physical symptoms and treatment (Guideline on detecting the need for psychosocial care, 2017). These are mostly physical consequences that are clearly linked to the specific nature of the cancer, consequences of the treatment, psychsocial problems and general complaints.

Row 2:\nHepato cell carcinomes: firstly, the systemic therapy used in the studies (sorafenib) is less potent than the current standard combination treatment of atezolizumab with bevacizumab. secondly, technically inferior dosimetry of TARE has been applied in the present studies. The studies used the so-called body surface area (BSA) method for the calculation of the activity to be administered. This method does not take into account the actual dose in the tumour and in the surrounding tissue, and leads to structured dosing. meanwhile, studies with individualised dosimetries have been able to achieve better therapeutic outcomes with lower doses in the liver, liver and tumour. Row 3:\nHepatocellular carcinoma: Due to the lack of randomized studies with the current standard system therapy and limitations in the dosimetry of TARE used, there is no advice to be given on prioritizing treatment with TARE versus atezolizumab with bevacizumab. However, one of the inclusion criteria of the IMbrave 150 study was that there were no longer any local treatment options.",
