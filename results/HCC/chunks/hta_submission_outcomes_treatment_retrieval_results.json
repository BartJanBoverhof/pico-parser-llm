The HR and the corresponding 2sided 95% CI were estimated using a Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group as a factor, and stratified by the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors. Superiority hypotheses were tested for OS using a stratified log-rank test with the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors. No multiplicity adjustments were needed for testing of the non-inferiority and superiority of OS due to the closed testing principle. Two interim analyses were performed. Since the study was not stopped at the first or second interim analysis, non-inferiority for OS was tested first at the final analysis with a non-inferiority margin of 1.08, which indicated that lenvatinib preserved at least 60% (corresponding to δ = 0.60) of the sorafenib treatment effect versus placebo as observed in the sorafenib SHARP and Asia-Pacific trials [5,6]. Non-inferiority was declared if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for HR was <1.08 at the final analysis.",

It noted from the clinical studies that life expectancy without sorafenib was unlikely to be greater than 24 months and was potentially as low as 7.9 months, although the latter was based on SHARP, which was stopped early. The committee considered that evidence from the clinical studies of sorafenib plus best supportive care suggested that it increased median survival by more than 2.8 months compared with placebo plus best supportive care, and the company's economic model predicted a mean gain in overall survival of 6.1 months, although this depended on the method of extrapolation. Although the committee noted that sorafenib is licensed for indications other than hepatocellular carcinoma, the committee considered sorafenib to fulfil the small population criterion for an end-of life treatment.",

Results\nof an indirect comparison suggest that atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is more effective than lenvatinib. But this is uncertain because there is no direct evidence comparing them. Despite the uncertainty in the indirect comparison, the most likely cost-effectiveness estimates for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab compared with sorafenib and with lenvatinib\nare within what NICE considers an acceptable use of NHS resources.

According to the latest available data, globally, HCC ranks seventh in incidence and fourth in direct mortality from cancer (1). The incidence of HCC increases with age (exceptionally it occurs before 40 years and the median age at diagnosis in our midst is between 65-70 years), being more frequent in men than in women (2). The rate of incidence is higher in western and south-eastern Africa, where the main etiological factors are hepatitis B and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection.",

Conclusion From the limited literature available, it appears that patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma had a statistically significantly longer survival when taking sorafenib than when taking placebo. b. interactions 4.1 During treatment of patients with hepatocelluloma in phase III trials with sorafenic acid, the only serious adverse reactions occurred in 52% of patients (p = 54%; p = 0.49% for those who received placebo). The frequency of serious (grade 3/ 4) adverse reactions occurring at least 2% more frequently in the sorafenib group than in the placebo group were: hypertension (4 vs 1%), diarrhoea (11 vs 2%), lymphoedema (3 vs 0%), abdominal pain (9 vs 6%), hand feeding reactions (8 vs 1%).

The REFLECT study demonstrated superiority of lenvatinib compared to sorafenib in the outcomes of progression-free survival (median 7.4 versus 3.7 months, respectively, with a HR of 0.66 and a 95% CI of 0.57 to 0.77, p< 0.001) and response rate (24.1% versus 9.2%), OR 3.13 (95% CI 2.15 to 4.56, p < 0.001), however these results are not critical for this evaluation.
