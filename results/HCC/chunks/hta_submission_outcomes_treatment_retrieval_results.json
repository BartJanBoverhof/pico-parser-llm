Furthermore, it must be noted that no usable data are available for the selection of specific AEs. In this situation, it is conceivable that the overall conclusion on added benefit may change materially if the missing information became available, since the presented event rates also reveal potential disadvantages of lenvatinib. For this reason, it is not possible to adequately weigh all positive and negative effects of lenvatinib. For research question 1, an added benefit of lenvatinib is therefore not proven.

By contrast, there was a hint of lesser benefit for the cognitive functioning dimension of health-related quality of life. Furthermore, it must be noted that no usable data are available for the selection of specific AEs. In this situation, it is conceivable that the overall conclusion on added benefit may change materially if the missing information became available, since the presented event rates also reveal potential disadvantages of lenvatinib. For this reason, it is not possible to adequately weigh all positive and negative effects of lenvatinib. For research question 1, an added benefit of lenvatinib is therefore not proven.

The HR and the corresponding 2sided 95% CI were estimated using a Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group as a factor, and stratified by the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors. Superiority hypotheses were tested for OS using a stratified log-rank test with the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors. No multiplicity adjustments were needed for testing of the non-inferiority and superiority of OS due to the closed testing principle. Two interim analyses were performed. Since the study was not stopped at the first or second interim analysis, non-inferiority for OS was tested first at the final analysis with a non-inferiority margin of 1.08, which indicated that lenvatinib preserved at least 60% (corresponding to δ = 0.60) of the sorafenib treatment effect versus placebo as observed in the sorafenib SHARP and Asia-Pacific trials [5,6]. Non-inferiority was declared if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for HR was <1.08 at the final analysis.",

It noted from the clinical studies that life expectancy without sorafenib was unlikely to be greater than 24 months and was potentially as low as 7.9 months, although the latter was based on SHARP, which was stopped early. The committee considered that evidence from the clinical studies of sorafenib plus best supportive care suggested that it increased median survival by more than 2.8 months compared with placebo plus best supportive care, and the company's economic model predicted a mean gain in overall survival of 6.1 months, although this depended on the method of extrapolation.

To extrapolate beyond the\nend of the trial, the company applied 5 parametric models: exponential,\nGompertz, log logistic, log normal and Weibull, plus a hybrid analysis that the company considered the most robust. The committee understood\nthat the ERG preferred the fully parametric log normal model because a hybrid approach was only appropriate when there was a strong rationale\nfor not using all of the available data to inform the extrapolated curve. The committee stated that the log normal distribution was the best statistical fit of the 5 distributions explored by the company. The\ncommittee noted that based on the Kass et al. criteria, the Bayesian\ninformation criterion statistics strongly indicated that the log normal distribution was a better fit to the observed data than the Weibull. The\ncommittee also heard from the clinical expert that approximately 10% of patients are still having sorafenib treatment at 3 years, which supported\nusing the log normal distribution. The committee concluded that the\ncompany's fully parametric method using the log normal distribution was the most robust estimate of treatment duration.",

According to the latest available data, globally, HCC ranks seventh in incidence and fourth in direct mortality from cancer (1). The incidence of HCC increases with age (exceptionally it occurs before 40 years and the median age at diagnosis in our midst is between 65-70 years), being more frequent in men than in women (2).

The combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab is an option that adds therapeutic value to the treatment of patients with advanced and/ or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received prior systemic therapy with superior efficacy and a safety profile distinct from sorafenib in line with the known profile for atezoizumab or bevazib alone and may present more adverse events. The DGCCSSNSYF has issued a funding resolution for the indication of TECENTRIQ® (atezolizumab) in combination with bevacizumab, in the treatment of adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received prior systemic therapy, with hepatic function (Child-Pugh carcinomas: a phase III randomised, double-blind, stage A), an ECOG score of 0 or 1, in the absence of a placebo-controlled trial.

Unlike other solid tumors, for which the therapeutic decision is made based on the TNM classification, there is no consensus prognostic classification for HCC7. Therefore, several classifications or scores have been proposed including the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 8 classification which has the advantage of enabling a prognosis stratification and proposing a treatment algorithm. When HCC is at an early stage (BC 0-A), patients are generally eligible for curative treatment by surgery, radiosurgery or transplantation. In case of failure, refractory disease or ineligibility for TACE, or in the presence of vascular invasion and/ or extrahepatic injury (advanced stage CLC), treatment with sorafenib is recommended in patients with preserved general condition (ECOG ≤ 2) and preserved hepatic function (Child-Pugh A). In adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (stage BCLC B or C) who have not received prior systemic therapy, the medical need is therefore considered to be partially met by sorafenib.

The 1st amendment (6 January 2014) mainly consisted of additions and clarifications regarding certain selection criteria (pre-cancer treatment, concomitant treatment, etc.), the addition of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire as a secondary quality of life assessment criterion (with updated statistical analysis), and the modification of the follow-up time for overall survival (life expectancy 2 to 3 months). The following two amendments consisted in amendments and clarification regarding the events that were expected to occur in the analyses.

There is no significant difference in most of the domains assessed by the QLQ-C30 questionnaire.There is no evidence of added therapeutic value of lenvatinib in the outcome life. The rate of adverse events was 18.9 patient-years in the lenvatinib group and 19.7 events per patient-year in the sorafenib group.Therefore, there is no evidence of additional harm from Lenvatinib in the outcome number of events the rate of Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions Adverse events resulting from treatment of grade 3 or higher occurred with no rates with lenvatinig and sorafenig (75.0% versus 66.5%). In the sorafenib arm, fatal adverse events occurred in four (1%) and included tumour haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke, respiratory failure and sudden death (one for each). Thus, there is no evidence of additional harm from lenvatinib in the treatment-related mortality outcome.",

The TLV clinical expert considers that the study design, where a second course of STRIDE was possible for some patients, could be a treatment option for isolated patients in Sweden. In Sweden, patients are treated first-line with sorafenib or lenvatinib if atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is not appropriate. However, according to the TLV Clinical Expert, an equivalent efficacy of sorefenib/lenvatinib is expected irrespective of patients' suitability for atezoizumab + bevaziumab. EMA considers that the adverse reactions of STRIDE are significant, but that relatively few patients discontinue treatment and that most of the side effects are clinically manageable. EMA is of the opinion that the side effect profile of ST RIDE is not significantly worse than that of sorafenib.[2] TLV's clinical expert considers STRITE's side effects were expected and that they do not differ significantly from other studies with combined immunotherapy. Furthermore, the expert believes that the Grade 3 and 4 adverse effects were comparable in STRIDEs and sorabenibs, and that it was positive that STRIDA did not cause side effects.",
