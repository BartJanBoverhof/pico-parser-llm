It noted from the clinical studies that life expectancy without sorafenib was unlikely to be greater than 24 months and was potentially as low as 7.9 months, although the latter was based on SHARP, which was stopped early. The committee considered that evidence from the clinical studies of sorafenib plus best supportive care suggested that it increased median survival by more than 2.8 months compared with placebo plus best supportive care, and the company's economic model predicted a mean gain in overall survival of 6.1 months, although this depended on the method of extrapolation.

According to the latest available data, globally, HCC ranks seventh in incidence and fourth in direct mortality from cancer (1). The incidence of HCC increases with age (exceptionally it occurs before 40 years and the median age at diagnosis in our midst is between 65-70 years), being more frequent in men than in women (2). The rate of incidence is higher in western and south-eastern Africa, where the main etiological factors are hepatitis B and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection.",

The estimated clinical benefit would be 5, considering the HR 0.58 and a difference of 9.6 months in SG from the extrapolation of the KM curves (22). The recently published updated analysis of an additional 12 months of follow-up shows somewhat reduced outcomes (HR 0.66 and difference from medians of 5.9 months), but with that benefit the assessment would be maintained (21).

The combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab is an option that adds therapeutic value to the treatment of patients with advanced and/ or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received prior systemic therapy with superior efficacy and a safety profile distinct from sorafenib in line with the known profile for atezoizumab or bevazib alone and may present more adverse events.

Adjusted for patient-years, the rate of adverse event was 18.9 patient-year episodes in the Lenvatinib group and 19.7 episodes per patient year in the Sorafenib group.

Based on these investigations, the company assumes that the proportionate hazards assumption is not rejected for OS in HIMALAYA, OS in IMbrave150 and PFS in IM Brave150. For PPS in HIMALAYA the company considers that it is difficult to draw conclusive conclusions on the proportional risks assumption and therefore the results of the indirect comparison must be interpreted with caution. The company's indirect comparitions are anchored in MAIC6 analyses. 6 Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons 7 Treatment effect modifiers can be adjusted to the right edge of the table, a plus m to match Table 3 Baseline Characteristics of IMbrave150 and HIMALAYA (Reed is the weighted population) Figures are classified in accordance with Chapter 30 Section 23 of the Privacy and Confidentiality Act.

In the health economics model, all patients start in the progression free state and may then remain in the same state or be moved to progression illness or death. Patients who are progression freer may receive treatment with STRIDE or any of the comparison alternatives or no drug therapy. Also, patients who have progressed may receive weekly drug therapy or non-drug therapy. For patients whose HCC has a non-viral etiology, the company reports an analysis comparing STRIDE with Tecentriq plus bevacizumab. The analysis is a cost-benefit analysis using the same type of model as compared to sorafenib and Lenvima respectively. Section 4.1.2 presents the result of the company' s comparison against Tecentrq plusbevacizumb for patients with HCC having a non viral etiology. TLV considers that it is reasonable to assume comparable efficacy between STRIDE and Tecentriq plus bevacizumab and therefore makes a cost comparison.",
