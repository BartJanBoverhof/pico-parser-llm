Nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab each lead to a significant prolongation in overall survival compared with docetaxel and also to a significant reduction in side effects. Accordingly, the guidelines regularly prefer immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. However, PD-L1 negative tumours are a fundamental exception. In these cases, the guidelines predominantly do not recommend a regular preference of immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, in PD-L1 negative tumours, alternative cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are also determined as an appropriate comparator therapy for the immune checkpoint inhibitors. For ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel, no additional benefit was shown",

The risk of bias of the results for the endpoint of overall survival is rated as high. This is justified\nby the high percentage of patients who switch from the docetaxel arm to the sotorasib arm during the course of the study and due to the unclear percentage of censoring at the start of\nthe study. At the endpoint level of the endpoint category of side effects and for the endpoint of health status, the risk of bias is classified as high due to the differential percentages of patients\nincluded in the evaluations between the treatment arms. For the endpoints of health status, discontinuation due to AEs, non-severe and non-serious specific AEs, the lack of blinding additionally contributes to the high risk of bias of the results.

In this group, consideration may be given to the use of chemotherapy (dosectaxel or pemetrexed), docetaxel in combination with nintedanib, EGFR inhibitors in patients who have not received these medicines in the first line, or osymertinib in patients previously treated with first or second generation EGFR blockers, ALK inhibitors if ALK gene rearrangement, immunity (nivolumab or atezolizumab), palliative radiotherapy or symptomatic progression are observed.

Firstly, in the analysis of the effect on the payer' s budget, it allows to estimate the potential costs related to the financing of a new therapy from public funds. The estimates of the costs associated with the new therapy (tomorrow scenario) are comparable to what we currently spend on the treatment of a given health problem (today' s scenario).
