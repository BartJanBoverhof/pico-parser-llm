Accordingly, the guidelines regularly prefer immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. However, PD-L1 negative tumours are a fundamental exception. In these cases, the guidelines predominantly do not recommend a regular preference of immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, in PD-L1 negative tumours, alternative cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are also determined as an appropriate comparator therapy for the immune checkpoint inhibitors.

The risk of bias of the results for the endpoint of overall survival is rated as high.

The costs of the treatment are estimated in the currency of your country, and the health effects are most often expressed in years of life gained (LYG) or quality adjusted life years (QALY) as a result of using the treatment. A comparison of the cost and effect values associated with using the new treatment and their comparison with the cost/benefit values of existing treatments is used to answer the question of whether the health benefit achieved by the individual patient with the new therapy is higher than the cost of the reimbursable treatment. The results of the health cost-effects index are compared with the so-called profitability threshold, i.e. a result that signals that, given the resources of our country (expressed in GDP), the maximum cost of a new therapy, which is expected to be associated with obtaining an individual health effect (1 LYG or 1 QALY) compared to existing therapies, should not exceed three times the GDP per capita. Currently, the cost-efficiency level is PLN 175 926/QALY (PLN 3 58 x 642).",

It is currently the only inhibitor of Kras G12c approved by the European Medicines Agency, at a dosage of 960 mg/day PO, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. As the biology of lung cancer has become known, new drugs have been developed that act on specific components of the cancer. These drugs are called biologic or targeted therapeutics. These mutations initiate the oncogenic process and activate signaling pathways that the tumour needs to survive. Blocking this signaling can induce apoptosis and tumour regression. This is the framework for the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced CPNPC with mutated KRAS G12C, oral therapeutics and with the possibility of sequential use after chemotherapy or immunotherapy. In case of progression, the second line of treatment for advanced cPNPC consists of docetaxel monotherapy, or with pemetrex or docetaxil + nitendanib combination, or PD-L1 inhibitors such as nivolumab, pembrozolizumab or pentotubes, followed by discontinuous tubulination of the tubule, which reduces the activity of docopib, and a decrease in its activity of an anti-tubulin agent, which is a reducing agent in the circulatory system.

Considering that CPNPC corresponds to about 85.0% of the cases of lung cancers, it is possible to conclude that there are about 4,603 new cases of cPNPC diagnosed annually in Portugal. However, only recently, it has been possible to robustly evaluate the prevalence of the p.G12C mutation in patients with CPNCP. To do this, data from the AACR GENIE registry, an international registry with information from 19 of the main cancer treatment centers in the world, is required. In this Lumykras (Sasibotor) registry there were a total 13,243 patients with cPNCP, of which 29.0% (n=3838) had a KRAS mutation and 12.01% (n = 16.04), specifically had the PPNPC mutation. it is possible to conclude that, of the 4,603 cases of CPNPC diagnosed annually, 557 (12,1%) will be KRAS p.G12C positive.",
