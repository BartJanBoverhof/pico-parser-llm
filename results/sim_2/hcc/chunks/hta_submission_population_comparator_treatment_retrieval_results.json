FIGURE 4.1: TRIAL PROFILE [1] A non-inferiority test of overall survival (OS) between lenvatinib and sorafenib was done using a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of hazard ratio (HR) (lenvatinib:sorafenib). The HR and the corresponding 2sided 95% CI were estimated using a Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group as a factor, and stratified by the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors. Superiority hypotheses were tested for OS using a stratified log-rank test with the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors. No multiplicity adjustments were needed for testing of the non-inferiority and superiority of OS due to the closed testing principle. Two interim analyses were performed. Since the study was not stopped at the first or second interim analysis, non-inferiority for OS was tested first at the final analysis with a non-inferiority margin of 1.08, which indicated that lenvatinib preserved at least 60% (corresponding to δ = 0.60) of the sorafenib treatment effect versus placebo as observed in the sorafenib SHARP and Asia-Pacific trials [5,6]. Non-inferiority was declared if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for HR was <1.08 at the final analysis.",

Overall, HCC patients are categorized into those with early HCC who benefit from curative therapy, those with intermediate and advanced disease who have benefited from palliative treatments, and finally patients who have terminal disease who are offered symptomatic treatment.[3] Patients with early disease (BCLCC A) are evaluated for surgical removal of the tumor, liver transplantation or percutaneous ablation (destruction of cancer cells by means of subtle chemotherapy or hyper-hypothermia, where in particular radiofrequency (RFA) therapy has been introduced in Denmark) with the possibility of five-year recovery, and have a high incidence of hepatohepatitis over five years, and do not have symptoms and are still dependent on interstitial treatment.[3] About 50-75 percent of the patients with BCC who respond to this treatment have no symptoms or no symptoms are still undergoing treatment with liver cancer (BBCLC A, BCLC A) or in childhood cancer.[3]",

The company chose a propensity score, a method of\nstatistical matching, to do this for baseline characteristics reported across both SHARP and GIDEON.

It is recommended that patients be treated until loss of clinical benefit or onset of unacceptable toxicity. Efficacy The efficacy data for the combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab are derived from the GO30140 trial (Phase IB) which demonstrated an additive effect of bevazizumab with respect to atezoizumab monotherapy in patients with unresectable CHC, and from the IMbrave 150 trial (phase III) (15, 20).

According to the latest available data, globally, HCC ranks seventh in incidence and fourth in direct mortality from cancer (1). The incidence of HCC increases with age (exceptionally it occurs before 40 years and the median age at diagnosis in our midst is between 65-70 years), being more frequent in men than in women (2). The rate of incidence is higher in western and south-eastern Africa, where the main etiological factors are hepatitis B and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection.",

Unlike other solid tumors, for which the therapeutic decision is made based on the TNM classification, there is no consensus prognostic classification for HCC7. Therefore, several classifications or scores have been proposed including the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 8 classification which has the advantage of enabling a prognosis stratification and proposing a treatment algorithm. When HCC is at an early stage (BC 0-A), patients are generally eligible for curative treatment by surgery, radiosurgery or transplantation. In case of failure, refractory disease or ineligibility for TACE, or in the presence of vascular invasion and/ or extrahepatic injury (advanced stage CLC), treatment with sorafenib is recommended in patients with preserved general condition (ECOG ≤ 2) and preserved hepatic function (Child-Pugh A). In adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (stage BCLC B or C) who have not received prior systemic therapy, the medical need is therefore considered to be partially met by sorafenib.

The 1st amendment (6 January 2014) mainly consisted of additions and clarifications regarding certain selection criteria (pre-cancer treatment, concomitant treatment, etc.), the addition of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire as a secondary quality of life assessment criterion (with updated statistical analysis), and the modification of the follow-up time for overall survival (life expectancy 2 to 3 months). The following two amendments consisted in amendments and clarification regarding the events that were expected to occur in the analyses.

Experience According to the Periodic Safety Update Report for the first half of 2007, 19,086 patients were treated during that period (8740 commercially and 10,346 in clinical trials). 1The term \" adverse reactions\" refers to complaints and symptoms regardless of cause. Clinical pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely with concomitant use of agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 (midazolam, dextromethorphan, omeprazole). It cannot be excluded that sorafenib increases the concentrations of co-administered P-gp substrates (such as digoxin), CYP2B6 (like bupropion, cyclophosphamide, efavirenz, metronidazole), CYP8C2 (like paclitaxel, amodiaquine, repaglinide), or CYP2C9 (like acetoacetylsalicylate).

In 2000, the standardized incidence was 1.6/100,000 men and 0.3/100,000 women. There was no increase over time. Risk factors in Europe are: hepatitis C (60-70%), alcohol consumption (20%), hepatitis B (10-15%) and other (10%). In a European study covering 1990-1994, the 5-year survival rate for the Netherlands was 7% and the 1-year survivorship rate was 22%.2 Stage classification. Several factors are important for the prognosis and thus for the indication for treatment, including tumour size, degree of tumour spread, liver function (Child-Pugh stage), the general physical condition of the patient (performance status; PS), and symptoms associated with cancer.",

Dose interruptions followed by dose reductions were allowed for lenvitinib-related liver toxicities (reduced to 8 and 4 mg / day, or 4 mg on alternate days). All subjects in the sorabenib arm received an initial dose of 400 mg orally twice daily; dose adjustment was made according to the geographic region. Investigators were assessed with mRIST or CMR carcinoma progression according to geographical region. The quality of life was assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire and by a specific instrument for hepatocellular carcinoma (EORTC qlq-hcc18).

The expert believes that at present there is no evidence that etiology has any relevance for the response to treatment. I published the study from IM150 in which atezozizumab+ bevaxizumab was compared to bevajizumab as a treatment for HCC and no difference in efficacy was observed in patients with atherosclerosis (≥ 95%) in the subgroup of 1,05 to 1,68 patients with HCC plus sorafenil (≥ KIHRK1,63) [5].

TLV assumes that Lenvima treatment can be continued after progression, which is the same as the assumption made for STRIDE and sorafenib. TLV assumed that 40 percent of patients receive follow-up treatment. After treatment with Stride, half of the patients are assumed to receive soraphenib and half of those patients are considered to be receiving sorafenima. Patients treated with first-line Lenven or Lenven are equally divided between Stivarga (regorafenib) and Cabometyx (kabozantinib). TLV presents sensitivity analyses with other assumptions about follow-on treatments. The Company reports a cost comparison between STRIDE and Tecentriq plus bevacizumab. The Company' s cost comparisons include drug and drug administration costs. Based on the indirect comparison reported by the Company (see section 2.4.2), it is assumed that treatment with Tecentrq + bevazizumab would result in a longer progression-free survival compared to STRIDES. Therefore, drug and medication administration costs are calculated according to the PFS curves for the respective treatments.",

The TLV clinical expert considers that the study design, where a second course of STRIDE was possible for some patients, could be a treatment option for isolated patients in Sweden. In Sweden, patients are treated first-line with sorafenib or lenvatinib if atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is not appropriate. However, according to the TLV Clinical Expert, an equivalent efficacy of sorefenib/lenvatinib is expected irrespective of patients' suitability for atezoizumab + bevaziumab. EMA considers that the adverse reactions of STRIDE are significant, but that relatively few patients discontinue treatment and that most of the side effects are clinically manageable. EMA is of the opinion that the side effect profile of ST RIDE is not significantly worse than that of sorafenib.[2] TLV's clinical expert considers STRITE's side effects were expected and that they do not differ significantly from other studies with combined immunotherapy.

More than two-thirds of HCC occurs in cirrhotic livers, but HCC can also occur in livers without cirrhomosis, especially in non-alcoholic fatty liver, chronic hepatitis B and porphyria. Risk factors to HCC are mainly viruses (hepatitis B and C), liver toxicity (alcohol and aflatoxin), and metabolic diseases (diabetes mellitus, hepatic fatty hepatitis, hemochromatosis, which affects the liver). The survival rate of patients with hepatitis B or porphyry can be reduced by up to 3 months after treatment, depending on the medication used.[1] The median survival time for patients with liver palliative disease is 40 years, but the average survival is less than 3 years after treatment.[1]",

TLV compares STRIDA with the three comparator alternatives sorafenib, Lenvima and Tecentriq plus bevacizumab. In TLV' s baseline scenario with sorafenig as comparator, the cost per QALY is approximately SEK 2.4 million. In the comparison with Lenvimi, the costs per QAlY are about SEK 1.7 million. The TLV cost comparison between STRIDE and Te centriq plus Bevacizumb shows that the high cost of treatment for STRIDI is approximately $490,000 higher than the cost of the comparator alternative. The result in TLV: cost comparator is based on the assumption of comparable efficacy in OS and PFS and the time horizon is assumed to be [---] months.",
