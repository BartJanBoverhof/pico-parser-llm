Retrospective analyses have shown that TACE outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival can be improved by further differentiating the indication within the criteria of BC BLC stage. In particular, the size and number of tumour cores and the severity of the dysfunction are of minor importance. The vascularisation of the tumour core plays an important role in the outcome of TACE. Pseudoencapsulation suggests better outcomes than in poorly vascularized and diffuse arterially supplied tumours. Tumor sites at the 'water gap' between arterial supply territories also present increased demands on the interventional treatment technique. This involves high quality intraprocedural imaging, possibly including cone beam CT under arterial perfusion to clarify selective vascularisation. The greater the selectivity of transarterial therapy and the more pronounced and comprehensive the devascularizing effect of the embolization measures, the better the efficacy of TACE and the lesser the side-effect.",

Of course, the limited availability of donor organs also plays an important role. The available analyses are mainly based on morphometric criteria, i.e. the number and size of tumour nodes. In the case of purely hepatic infection, the risk of recurrence after liver transplantation is correlated with the number (maximum or cumulative) size of existing tumours [151]. The so-called Milan criteria are used as the standard established criterion for the indication for liver transplant in most countries, as well as in Germany [152]. Patients with an unstable HCC within the Milan criteria have a 5-year survival rate of 65 - 80% and an HCCR rate of approximately 10-12% after liver transplants, [153] Therefore, the Milan criterion accepted in Germany also represents a high priority for planning liver transplantations every 3 months.

Predictive molecular analyses are not yet required in regular diagnostics, but may be employed for advanced therapy planning. The molecular changes associated with HCC development have been characterized in multiple studies. These include genetic, epigenetic, and also transcriptional and posttranslational changes. Evidence for a significant involvement of germline mutations in HCC-associated tumors or a lack of substantial involvement in the HCC tumors is available in the main therapeutic protocols. However, their inclusion in clinical trials is either the subject of ongoing studies or corresponding studies have not resulted in corresponding therapeutic approvals in Europe/Germany. Regarding the currently existing entity-wide approval test for NTRK inhibitors in Germany, it is noted that so far no definitive test has been able to be carried out for the occurrence of the required NRTK translocation therapies for HCC in the context of regular tumour induction therapy other than HCC, so that there is currently no definite therapeotic indication other than the existence of a molecular diagnostic test for cervical cancer.

Nevertheless, a growing body of evidences strongly suggests that surveillance of patients with cirrhosis for the early detection of HCC could be effective in terms of survival prolongation at least in well selected cases. Moreover it seems unlikely that new randomised controlled trials will be put up to solve this issue. In Belgium, surveillance for HCC addresses almost exclusively patients with cirrhosis regardless of the aetiology, patients with chronic hepatitis C with extensive fibrosis of F3 stage in the METAVIR classification and HbsAg carriers. In these at-risk patients, surveillance should be reserved to those manifesting their willingness to attend the surveillance program and exhibiting a life expectancy of at least 5 years.

Retrospective analyses have shown that TACE outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival can be improved by further differentiating the indication within the criteria of BC BLC stage. In particular, the size and number of tumour cores and the severity of the dysfunction are of minor importance. The vascularisation of the tumour core plays an important role in the outcome of TACE. Pseudoencapsulation suggests better outcomes than in poorly vascularized and diffuse arterially supplied tumours. Tumor sites at the 'water gap' between arterial supply territories also present increased demands on the interventional treatment technique. This involves high quality intraprocedural imaging, possibly including cone beam CT under arterial perfusion to clarify selective vascularisation. The greater the selectivity of transarterial therapy and the more pronounced and comprehensive the devascularizing effect of the embolization measures, the better the efficacy of TACE and the lesser the side-effect.",

Of course, the limited availability of donor organs also plays an important role. The available analyses are mainly based on morphometric criteria, i.e. the number and size of tumour nodes. In the case of purely hepatic infection, the risk of recurrence after liver transplantation is correlated with the number (maximum or cumulative) size of existing tumours [151]. The so-called Milan criteria are used as the standard established criterion for the indication for liver transplant in most countries, as well as in Germany [152]. Patients with an unstable HCC within the Milan criteria have a 5-year survival rate of 65 - 80% and an HCCR rate of approximately 10-12% after liver transplants, [153] Therefore, the Milan criterion accepted in Germany also represents a high priority for planning liver transplantations every 3 months. If these criteria continue to be met, the corresponding matchMELD will be upgraded every 3 months.",

Other recent key references (72, 73). Liver transplantation should be reserved for patients with 5-year survival comparable to that of non-HCC patients, i.e. approximately 70%. Prognosis is assessed primarily on the basis of the diameter of the largest tumour and the number of tumours in the liver. There must be no extrahepatic tumour. Microinvasion is a very poor prognostic sign and there is some correlation to tumour size and number as well as certain biomarkers; however, there are no reliable, either radiological or biomarker methods to detect microinvision, which is why microbial invasion is not yet included in the selection of liver transplants. However, if one could use multiple criteria to validate the prognosis of patients with micro-transplantation, we will be able to use a better prognosis for those patients with non-AFPs (see below).",

This is a fine distinction that is not always possible to make. An additional concern about fine needle biopsy is the risk of bleeding and seeding. Most studies that demonstrate seeding after needle biopsy do not specify the size of the lesion that was biopsied (42, 43). Morphological characteristics can help in the separation of HGDN from HCC, but the addition of special dyes and immunohistochemical dyes is advised. Special staining for reticulin, whereby loss or alteration of reticulation is seen in HCC markers (44) is known. Additionally, by applying a panel of immune histological markers of Glycoprotein 703, Glutamicin 703, and Vitamins 70 can assist in the differentiation of tumors (such as heat shock) from the tumor (diffusion).

Surveillance with abdominal ultrasound should be offered to individuals at high risk for developing HCC. Accurate diagnosis, staging, and liver function are crucial when determining the optimal therapeutic approach. The BCLC staging system is widely endorsed in Western countries. Managing this pathology requires a multidisciplinary, personalized approach, generally with a multimodal strategy. Surgery remains the only curative option, albeit local and systemic therapy may also increase survival when surgery is not suitable.

Recommendations are graded in 3 categories according to the level of evidence of data found in the literature.Results: The diagnosis and staging of HCC is essentially based on clinical, biological and imaging features. A pathological analysis obtained by a biopsy of tumoral and non-tumoral liver is rec- ommended. HCCs can be divided into 2 groups, taking into account not only the tumor stage, but also liver function. HCCs accessible to curative treatments are tumors that are in Milan criteria or with an AFP score ≤ 2, mainly treated by surgical resection, local ablation or liver transplantation. Intermediate and advanced HCCs with no liver insufﬁciency, accessible only to palliative treatments, beneﬁt from TACE, SIRT or systemic therapy according to the presence or absence of macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. Conclusion: Such recommendations are in permanent optimization and each individual case must be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert board.",

The presence of homolateral tumor-related portal vein exten- sion may be discussed in an expert center for resection when the contralateral main trunk is free from disease [32]. How- ever , French cohorts showed that surgery does not provide OS beneﬁt compared to sorafenib in this setting [33]. Ideally, resection of HCC should consist in an anatomical resection with margins of 2 cm [34,35] .In the absence of advanced liver ﬁbrosis, resection is the gold standard and the possibilities are greater than in cirrhotic patients, even for large tumors [36].Local ablationPercutaneous ablation is an alternative to surgery, usually well tolerated, without signiﬁcant amputation of non- tumoral parenchyma. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation are the most performed techniques and are possible if the tumor is accessible to puncture guided by US or CT and located away from the hilum and large bile ducts. Biliodigestive anastomosis or signiﬁcant ascites are contraindications to local ablation.Local ablation represents an effective alternative to surgery for small HCCs under certain conditions. To date, 6 randomized studies [37—42] and 6 retrospective studies [43—48] with propensity score analysis compared surgery with RFA. Most of these studies have limited statistical power because of the small number of patients. Among the ran-",

This concerns the treatment of the underlying liver dis- ease (including HCV), management of comorbidities and prevention of complications related to portal hyperten- sion in case of cirrhosis. In 2016, a retrospective cohort study lead to controversy by suggesting an increased risk of HCC recurrence in patients treated with direct act- ing antivirals (DAAs) [54].

Several observational studies, including some Italian ones, have given results consistent with the Asian data, confirming that half-yearly surveillance4 (level of evidence 2++) is effective in cirrhotic patients (considered at risk for annual incidence of HCC at around 2-45.6%) (Class of Evidence 2++). Advanced age (over 70-75) is not in itself a reason not to recommend periodic monitoring, as it does not preclude subsequent treatment8 (Level of Evidence 2+). The addition of periodic alpha-fetoprotein dosing to ultrasound surveillance does not substantially increase (approximately 6%) the rate of recognition of HCC at an early stage and significantly worsens the cost-effectiveness of surveillance, increasing the number of false positives (Leval of Evidences 2+) However, monitoring of the semihyperfetoma may not reduce the patient's risk of hypersensitivity to monitoring, except in the absence of available instruments. However, it remains an indicator of the risk of developing HCC and should be dosed at the time of detection of a focal liver lesion on cirrhosis to contribute to the diagnostic and prognostic framework.",

The use of chemotherapeutic agents in HCC patients, characterised by a high rate of marked impairment of more or less potent hepatic function, results in increased carcinogenicity associated with elevated risk of cancer, in addition to the intrinsically low toxicity of HCC-related carcinogens. In addition, HCC can be listed among cancers intrinsically characterized by less chemo-sensitivity. Numerous chemotherapeutic drugs, as single agents or in combination, have been experimented over the past decades in patients with HCC, producing more or less disappointing percentages of objective responses, without ever producing a solid demonstration of efficacy. Among the various cytotoxic drugs experimented and variously used in clinical practice, doxorubicin, used as a single agent, is reported.",

Row 2:\nHepato cellular cancer: For the second-line treatment, one RCT was found, comparing regorafenib with placebo (Bruix, 2017). The systematic literature analysis shows that treatment with regoraffenib could have positive effects on risk and overall survival. Due to the outcome of tumour responses, complications, and lack of evidence based on clinical findings, the overall literature findings were considered to be inaccurate due to the low quality of life. Survival gains from these groups together were statistically significant but did not meet the old PASKWIL criteria (OS of 10.2 versus 8.0 months; Δ 2.2 months, HR: 0.76; 95%-BI: 0.63 to 0.92; P = 0.005).

Recommendation Inform patients and family/neighbours about the possible emergence of complaints after treatment of HCC. Report these early consequences of cancer using a (validated) screening tool. This screening should be used from diagnosis to treatment and follow-up. Considerations Disease and treatment have major consequences The Health Council concludes that many patients, after intentional curative treatment for cancer, suffer from complaints (Health Council, 2007). These complaints may be limited or extensive, both physical and psychological in nature, and may occur early or later. This is called distress. By distress is meant: an unpleasant emotional experience of a psychological (cognitive, behavioural, emotional), social and/or spiritual nature that may interfere with the ability to effectively cope with cancer, the accompanying physical symptoms and treatment (Guideline on detecting the need for psychosocial care, 2017). These are mostly physical consequences that are clearly linked to the specific nature of the cancer, consequences of the treatment, psychsocial problems and general complaints.

Radiological methods are important for early documentation of objective signs of treatment response that correlate with survival. A disadvantage of the standard method RECIST in HCC is that there are effective treatments, such as some locoregional modalities and targeted drugs, that do not affect the size of tumors and where the clinical effect of treatment is therefore not captured [175]. The problem of the absence of tumor shrinkage was addressed with the introduction of the concept of viabletumor in the modified RECISTM criteria (mRECIST) [176]. Tumor viability is defined radiologically as the remaining contrast-suppressing area in the tumor I. Instead of measuring the maximum length of the tumor according to the MRCIST 1.1 method, the maximum diameter of the longest diametrical remaining area (MRCIST) or the maximum time remaining in the intermediate stage (TACRISTM) in the region after complete non-absorption or contraception of the HCC (T) is measured by TACRIST 1. However, several studies have shown that response (=ORR, overall response rate) after locoregional treatment as measured by mRECIST predicts survival (OS) [177].",

In large singular tumor, liver resection is often possible, but presupposes good liver function. In established HCC less than 3 cm, ablation is the first choice, thanks to good tolerability and low complication rate, which can allow treatment even for fragile patients. In choosing between resection or ablation, several factors must be weighed in addition to size, such as localization, co- morbidity and hepatic function. Ablation with increased risk of local recurrence, but it should be weighted against the possibility of reintervention, lower morbidities and cost [227-229].",

When ablation isn't appropriate due to localization or tumor size, but liver function is well preserved, resection is recommended. In case of multiple tumors or recurrence of HCC (no local recurrence) after previous resection or ablation, liver transplantation should be considered [230], as the risk of recurrence is lower after transplantation.
