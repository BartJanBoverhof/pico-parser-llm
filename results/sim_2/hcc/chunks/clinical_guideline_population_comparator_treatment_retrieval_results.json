Of course, the limited availability of donor organs also plays an important role. The available analyses are mainly based on morphometric criteria, i.e. the number and size of tumour nodes. In the case of purely hepatic infection, the risk of recurrence after liver transplantation is correlated with the number (maximum or cumulative) size of existing tumours [151]. The so-called Milan criteria are used as the standard established criterion for the indication for liver transplant in most countries, as well as in Germany [152]. Patients with an unstable HCC within the Milan criteria have a 5-year survival rate of 65 - 80% and an HCCR rate of approximately 10-12% after liver transplants, [153] Therefore, the Milan criterion accepted in Germany also represents a high priority for planning liver transplantations every 3 months. If these criteria continue to be met, the corresponding matchMELD will be upgraded every 3 months.",

Retrospective analyses have shown that TACE outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival can be improved by further differentiating the indication within the criteria of BC BLC stage. In particular, the size and number of tumour cores and the severity of the dysfunction are of minor importance. The vascularisation of the tumour core plays an important role in the outcome of TACE. Pseudoencapsulation suggests better outcomes than in poorly vascularized and diffuse arterially supplied tumours. Tumor sites at the 'water gap' between arterial supply territories also present increased demands on the interventional treatment technique. This involves high quality intraprocedural imaging, possibly including cone beam CT under arterial perfusion to clarify selective vascularisation. The greater the selectivity of transarterial therapy and the more pronounced and comprehensive the devascularizing effect of the embolization measures, the better the efficacy of TACE and the lesser the side-effect.",

Thus, in an evaluation of the UN-DOS database, the HCCR rate was 35.0% for AFP values > 1000 ng/ ml for transplantation. However, if patients are over 65 years of age, the indication for liver transplantation should be examined particularly carefully. More strongly, chronological age does not constitute a contraindication for a liver transplant [177], [178], biological age being the decisive factor. Chronological age per se does not constitute a contraindication for liver transplantation [177], [178], biological age is more decisive. In the context of transplantation evaluation, prognostically relevant comorbidities should therefore be excluded, especially in elderly patients (> 65-70 years), and thus an accumulation of risk factors should be avoided.",

The prognosis after transplantation is there- fore the same as for a similar underlying disease without HCC. However,these excellent results were obtained at a time when the average waiting time for liver trans- plantation was less than 6 months.

Patients with single small HCC (< 5 cm) or up to three lesions should be referred for these treatment modalities. Surgical resection and percutaneous treat- ment modalities in patients with cirrhosis have the dis- advantage that the remnant liver remains a premalignant condition with the potential to develop new HCC lesions in this part of the liver. • Liver transplantation should be considered in any patient with cirrhosis and a small (5cm or less single nodule or up to three lesions of 3 cm or less) HCC. • Hepatic resection should be considered as primary therapy in any patient with HCC and a non-cirrhotic liver (including fibrolamellar variant). • Resection can be carried out in highly selected patients with hepatic cirrhosis and well preserved hepatic function (Child Pugh A). Such surgery carries a high risk of postoperative decompensation and should be undertaken in units with expertise in hepat- ic resection and management of liver failure. • If surgery or transplantation is not possible, percuta- neous treatment modalities can be used as an alterna- tive.",

Of course, the limited availability of donor organs also plays an important role. The available analyses are mainly based on morphometric criteria, i.e. the number and size of tumour nodes. In the case of purely hepatic infection, the risk of recurrence after liver transplantation is correlated with the number (maximum or cumulative) size of existing tumours [151]. The so-called Milan criteria are used as the standard established criterion for the indication for liver transplant in most countries, as well as in Germany [152]. Patients with an unstable HCC within the Milan criteria have a 5-year survival rate of 65 - 80% and an HCCR rate of approximately 10-12% after liver transplants, [153] Therefore, the Milan criterion accepted in Germany also represents a high priority for planning liver transplantations every 3 months. If these criteria continue to be met, the corresponding matchMELD will be upgraded every 3 months.",

Retrospective analyses have shown that TACE outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival can be improved by further differentiating the indication within the criteria of BC BLC stage. In particular, the size and number of tumour cores and the severity of the dysfunction are of minor importance. The vascularisation of the tumour core plays an important role in the outcome of TACE. Pseudoencapsulation suggests better outcomes than in poorly vascularized and diffuse arterially supplied tumours. Tumor sites at the 'water gap' between arterial supply territories also present increased demands on the interventional treatment technique. This involves high quality intraprocedural imaging, possibly including cone beam CT under arterial perfusion to clarify selective vascularisation. The greater the selectivity of transarterial therapy and the more pronounced and comprehensive the devascularizing effect of the embolization measures, the better the efficacy of TACE and the lesser the side-effect.",

Thus, in an evaluation of the UN-DOS database, the HCCR rate was 35.0% for AFP values > 1000 ng/ ml for transplantation. However, if patients are over 65 years of age, the indication for liver transplantation should be examined particularly carefully. More strongly, chronological age does not constitute a contraindication for a liver transplant [177], [178], biological age being the decisive factor. Chronological age per se does not constitute a contraindication for liver transplantation [177], [178], biological age is more decisive. In the context of transplantation evaluation, prognostically relevant comorbidities should therefore be excluded, especially in elderly patients (> 65-70 years), and thus an accumulation of risk factors should be avoided.",

The screening involves deciding at what level the risk of HCC should be high enough to trigger screening, what screening test to carry out and how often it should be carried out. Finally, deciding what action an abnormal screen test should trigger. The risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis over a period of 5 years is about 7%. Since some groups of patients with Chronic Hepatitis B have an increased incidence of hepatocell carcinomas (hCC) even without having developed cirrhotic disease, screening for HCC should be performed in patients who have a family history of HCC, Asian patients over 40-50 years of age, and African patients over the age of 25 years.",

This is a fine distinction that is not always possible to make. An additional concern about fine needle biopsy is the risk of bleeding and seeding. Most studies that demonstrate seeding after needle biopsy do not specify the size of the lesion that was biopsied (42, 43). Morphological characteristics can help in the separation of HGDN from HCC, but the addition of special dyes and immunohistochemical dyes is advised. Special staining for reticulin, whereby loss or alteration of reticulation is seen in HCC markers (44) is known. Additionally, by applying a panel of immune histological markers of Glycoprotein 703, Glutamicin 703, and Vitamins 70 can assist in the differentiation of tumors (such as heat shock) from the tumor (diffusion).

Managing this pathology requires a multidisciplinary, personalized approach, generally with a multimodal strategy.

Recommendations are graded in 3 categories according to the level of evidence of data found in the literature.Results: The diagnosis and staging of HCC is essentially based on clinical, biological and imaging features. A pathological analysis obtained by a biopsy of tumoral and non-tumoral liver is rec- ommended. HCCs can be divided into 2 groups, taking into account not only the tumor stage, but also liver function. HCCs accessible to curative treatments are tumors that are in Milan criteria or with an AFP score ≤ 2, mainly treated by surgical resection, local ablation or liver transplantation. Intermediate and advanced HCCs with no liver insufﬁciency, accessible only to palliative treatments, beneﬁt from TACE, SIRT or systemic therapy according to the presence or absence of macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread.

The presence of homolateral tumor-related portal vein exten- sion may be discussed in an expert center for resection when the contralateral main trunk is free from disease [32]. How- ever , French cohorts showed that surgery does not provide OS beneﬁt compared to sorafenib in this setting [33]. Ideally, resection of HCC should consist in an anatomical resection with margins of 2 cm [34,35] .In the absence of advanced liver ﬁbrosis, resection is the gold standard and the possibilities are greater than in cirrhotic patients, even for large tumors [36].Local ablationPercutaneous ablation is an alternative to surgery, usually well tolerated, without signiﬁcant amputation of non- tumoral parenchyma. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation are the most performed techniques and are possible if the tumor is accessible to puncture guided by US or CT and located away from the hilum and large bile ducts. Biliodigestive anastomosis or signiﬁcant ascites are contraindications to local ablation.Local ablation represents an effective alternative to surgery for small HCCs under certain conditions. To date, 6 randomized studies [37—42] and 6 retrospective studies [43—48] with propensity score analysis compared surgery with RFA. Most of these studies have limited statistical power because of the small number of patients. Among the ran-",

Assessment of tumor extensionBeyond physical exam and AFP dosing, tumor assessment should include an abdominal MRI combined with a chest CT-scan or a thoraco-abdominal CT-scan, in order to assess tumor morphology (location, number and size of nodules), portal vascularization, and identify pathological lymph nodes or visceral metastasis (lungs, bones, adrenal glands . . .). Brain CT-scan and bone scintigraphy must only be per- formed in case of clinical suspicion of metastasis. Several studies showed that 18-FDG PET CT [16] and 11C-choline PET CT [17] may improve the detection of extrahepatic lesions. A recent publication suggested that 18-FDG PET could modify tumor staging and treatment allocation in patients with HCC\n[10].

Introduction\nThese guidelines are a collaborative work under the aus- pices of most of French medical societies involved in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim was to develop practical recommendations using only methodologically established evidence-based guidelines or primary evidence, and to achieve an interdisciplinary consensus. A writing multidisciplinary committee (from 8 medical societies), including experts from different special- ties involved in the management of HCC (hepatic surgeon, pathologist, radiation oncologist, medical oncologist and hepatogastroenterologists), reviewed recent literature until May 2020 and wrote a ﬁrst document. which was modi- ﬁed after further interactive discussions.",

This concerns the treatment of the underlying liver dis- ease (including HCV), management of comorbidities and prevention of complications related to portal hyperten- sion in case of cirrhosis. In 2016, a retrospective cohort study lead to controversy by suggesting an increased risk of HCC recurrence in patients treated with direct act- ing antivirals (DAAs) [54].

Several observational studies, including some Italian ones, have given results consistent with the Asian data, confirming that half-yearly surveillance4 (level of evidence 2++) is effective in cirrhotic patients (considered at risk for annual incidence of HCC at around 2-45.6%) (Class of Evidence 2++). Advanced age (over 70-75) is not in itself a reason not to recommend periodic monitoring, as it does not preclude subsequent treatment8 (Level of Evidence 2+). The addition of periodic alpha-fetoprotein dosing to ultrasound surveillance does not substantially increase (approximately 6%) the rate of recognition of HCC at an early stage and significantly worsens the cost-effectiveness of surveillance, increasing the number of false positives (Leval of Evidences 2+) However, monitoring of the semihyperfetoma may not reduce the patient's risk of hypersensitivity to monitoring, except in the absence of available instruments. However, it remains an indicator of the risk of developing HCC and should be dosed at the time of detection of a focal liver lesion on cirrhosis to contribute to the diagnostic and prognostic framework.",

Prior to the recent randomised trials of sorafenib, no medication had been shown to be effective in these patients, for whom the best supportive therapy remained the only valid therapeutic option. The efficacy of the multi-targeted small molecule kinase inhibitor soraphenib in the treatment of advanced stage HCC has been demonstrated in 2 randomised Phase III trials: SHARP52 and the Asia-Pacific study64. Both studies enrolled patients who were not eligible for any loco-regional treatment (either at diagnosis or after failure of any previous treatments), with good liver function (Child-Pugh). The two studies are significantly different in terms of patient characteristics, as the SHArP study was conducted in Israel (Western Europe), Australia (North America), and Korea (Eastern Asia), while the Taiwan (China). In both randomised trials, treatment with sorafenib (administered at a dose of 400 mg twice daily until instrumental and clinical progression or until onset of unacceptable toxicity) resulted in a significant prolongation of overall survival, and a significant lengthening of the time to disease progression (Evidence Level 1).",

The use of chemotherapeutic agents in HCC patients, characterised by a high rate of marked impairment of more or less potent hepatic function, results in increased carcinogenicity associated with elevated risk of cancer, in addition to the intrinsically low toxicity of HCC-related carcinogens. In addition, HCC can be listed among cancers intrinsically characterized by less chemo-sensitivity. Numerous chemotherapeutic drugs, as single agents or in combination, have been experimented over the past decades in patients with HCC, producing more or less disappointing percentages of objective responses, without ever producing a solid demonstration of efficacy. Among the various cytotoxic drugs experimented and variously used in clinical practice, doxorubicin, used as a single agent, is reported.",

A first consideration should be whether the patient is eligible for a liver transplant as this procedure represents a cure for both HCC and the underlying cirrhosis. However, in practice, liver transplantation is applicable to a very small fraction of cirrotic HCC patients due to clinical and oncological limitations associated with organisational and social considerations. Therefore, given the limited availability of organs, the use of transplantation must be based on the concept of equity between the different categories of patients and cannot disregard the calculation of the benefit of survival provided to the individual patient with transplantation compared to the expected results with other possible anticancer treatments The best survival results (75-80% at 5 years) after liver transplantation for HCC on hepatic cirrhosis are in patients who meet the Milan criteria, i.e. a single neoplasm ≤ 5 cm or multiples of no more than 3 nodes and diameter ≤ 326 cm (Level 2++).",

The studies used the so-called body surface area (BSA) method for the calculation of the activity to be administered. This method does not take into account the actual dose in the tumour and in the surrounding tissue, and leads to structured dosing. meanwhile, studies with individualised dosimetries have been able to achieve better therapeutic outcomes with lower doses in the liver, liver and tumour. Row 3:\nHepatocellular carcinoma: Due to the lack of randomized studies with the current standard system therapy and limitations in the dosimetry of TARE used, there is no advice to be given on prioritizing treatment with TARE versus atezolizumab with bevacizumab.

When ablation isn't appropriate due to localization or tumor size, but liver function is well preserved, resection is recommended. In case of multiple tumors or recurrence of HCC (no local recurrence) after previous resection or ablation, liver transplantation should be considered [230], as the risk of recurrence is lower after transplantation.
