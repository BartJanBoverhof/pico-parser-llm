Nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab each lead to a significant prolongation in overall survival compared with docetaxel and also to a significant reduction in side effects. Accordingly, the guidelines regularly prefer immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. However, PD-L1 negative tumours are a fundamental exception. In these cases, the guidelines predominantly do not recommend a regular preference of immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, in PD-L1 negative tumours, alternative cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are also determined as an appropriate comparator therapy for the immune checkpoint inhibitors. For ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel, no additional benefit was shown",

There are several approved treatments targeting specific driver mutations in NSCLC that have improved patient survival significantly compared with non-targeted treatments for patients with an actionable mutation(1). However, currently, no approved treatment is available that specifically targets the KRAS G12C driver mutation in NSCLC. Standard of care treatment for KRAS G12C mutated NSCLC is currently the same as for patients with nontargetable mutations. This includes PD-(L)1 inhibitors (with or without platinum chemotherapy) for first-line (1L)\ntreatment of advanced NSCLC.",

Based on a register study in the capital region, the KRAS G12C mutation occurred in X of non-squamous NSCLC patients (Data on file(5)). This equates to 292 KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC cases in Denmark in 2020. The\nestimated incidence of the KRAS G12C mutation is similar to the incidence suggested by two Danish clinical experts within NSCLC(2, 3). The two clinical experts suggested an annual incidence of 250-300 KRAS G12C\nmutations eligible for 1L treatment. Based on clinical validation, approximately 50% of the patients reach 2L\ntreatment each year. This equates to approximately 140 potential incident patients per year in Denmark. Furthermore, it was reported in the DLCR report that up to 26% of patients that started 1L treatment in 2020 was treated with curatively intended treatment this reduces the estimate to approximately 110 patients per\nyear in Denmark (4).

Discussion on the submitted documentation **Source Type:** hta_submission\n\nAs the standard 2L treatment of advanced KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC in Denmark, docetaxel was selected as the appropriate comparator. Sotorasib was investigated in a single-arm clinical trial, CodeBreak 100. No direct head-to-head evidence was\navailable to compare the clinical efficacy of sotorasib and docetaxel. In such circumstances, the relative efficacy\nof two treatments can often be estimated using indirect treatment comparison methods for OS and PFS. In this\nanalysis, the relative efficacy was assessed using an unanchored MAIC. This method allows assessment of\nefficacy between treatments when a common comparator is missing by adjusting for population-level differences present in different data sources (74). The MAIC used data from two clinical studies: the CodeBreak 100 trial for sotorasib, and the SELECT-1 trial for\ndocetaxel. Comparability of the data sources, and hence the feasibility and appropriateness of performing a\nMAIC, was assessed through a review of the design and population profiles of the studies involved in the analyses.",

However, the KRAS G12C mutation rarely occurs at the\nsame time as these other actionable mutations, meaning that existing tumor-targeted therapies are not an option for patients with KRAS G12C mutation (58-61). Patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC are therefore\nmanaged in the same way as those without an actionable mutation. In line with the current treatment guidelines from the DLCG (6), clinical experts (2, 3) confirmed that an increasing majority of patients in Denmark with NSCLC without currently actionable mutations now receive anti-\nPD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy or as monotherapy in the firstline of therapy. Clinical experts confirmed that sotorasib would be used as an alternative to docetaxel monotherapy following recurring disease after frontline therapy with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy(2, 3).",

Sotorasib is a targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation. Sotorasib has only been indirectly compared with current treatment. The results suggest\nthat, after platinum-based chemotherapy, sotorasib increases the time before the cancer gets worse and how long people live compared with current treatment. Sotorasib likely meets NICE's criteria to be a life-extending treatment at the end of life. But\nthere is uncertainty in the clinical evidence. Sotorasib has the potential to be cost\neffective, but more evidence is needed to address the uncertainties before it can be recommended for routine use. The evidence on sotorasib is promising. But, more data is being collected from the primary\nclinical trial and from an ongoing randomised controlled trial comparing sotorasib with docetaxel. Collecting additional data through the Cancer Drugs Fund may resolve some\nuncertainty in the clinical evidence. So, sotorasib is recommended for use in the Cancer\nDrugs Fund. © NICE 2024.

The clinical expert mentioned that in clinical practice, docetaxel is not expected to be better than docetaxel plus nintedanib in the first 6 months. The clinical expert also highlighted that nintedanib has greater toxicity so more people may stop treatment earlier, but added that this is unlikely to be a major driver.

Health system impact assessment, including the impact on the public payer's budget The Health System Impact Assessment consists of two important parts. Firstly, in the analysis of the effect on the payer' s budget, it allows to estimate the potential costs related to the financing of a new therapy from public funds. The estimates of the costs associated with the new therapy (tomorrow scenario) are comparable to what we currently spend on the treatment of a given health problem (today' s scenario). On this basis, it is possible to assess whether the new treatment will be able to cope with the increase in costs, or whether it will be necessary to allocate more funds to the treatment in the budget.

It is currently the only inhibitor of Kras G12c approved by the European Medicines Agency, at a dosage of 960 mg/day PO, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. As the biology of lung cancer has become known, new drugs have been developed that act on specific components of the cancer. These drugs are called biologic or targeted therapeutics. These mutations initiate the oncogenic process and activate signaling pathways that the tumour needs to survive. Blocking this signaling can induce apoptosis and tumour regression. This is the framework for the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced CPNPC with mutated KRAS G12C, oral therapeutics and with the possibility of sequential use after chemotherapy or immunotherapy. In case of progression, the second line of treatment for advanced cPNPC consists of docetaxel monotherapy, or with pemetrex or docetaxil + nitendanib combination, or PD-L1 inhibitors such as nivolumab, pembrozolizumab or pentotubes, followed by discontinuous tubulination of the tubule, which reduces the activity of docopib, and a decrease in its activity of an anti-tubulin agent, which is a reducing agent in the circulatory system. Dosage: 75 mg/m2 IV, 21/21 days; up to disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.",

To do this, data from the AACR GENIE registry, an international registry with information from 19 of the main cancer treatment centers in the world, is required.

Docetaxel or other chemotherapy is not always judged as medically appropriate. This may be, for example, in case of poor general condition, significant adverse reactions to previous chemotherapies, or insufficient or short-term disease control with previous therapy. There are no specific treatment recommendations for the more limited patient population. Once all treatment options have been exhausted, generally the best supportive treatment remains for these patients. The relative efficacy between Lumicras and docetaxel is considered to be overestimated and should be reviewed: the overall assessment of TLV based on clinical data is adjusted to reflect the overestimation of the clinical trial data and the analysis should be compared with the over-estimation from the previous health registry (docetaxel 141/ 202) which was assessed to have exceeded the survival rate. A direct comparative study between Lumykras and docetaxel has subsequently been published, in which the efficacy and safety of sotorasib compared to docetaxil in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced NSCLC following progression on prior platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy has been evaluated in an open-label, randomised Phase III study, CodeBreaK 200.",
