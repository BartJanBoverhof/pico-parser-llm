Nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab each lead to a significant prolongation in overall survival compared with docetaxel and also to a significant reduction in side effects. Accordingly, the guidelines regularly prefer immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. However, PD-L1 negative tumours are a fundamental exception. In these cases, the guidelines predominantly do not recommend a regular preference of immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, in PD-L1 negative tumours, alternative cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are also determined as an appropriate comparator therapy for the immune checkpoint inhibitors. For ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel, no additional benefit was shown",

In the opinion of the Agency, the circumstances of Article 13 of the Reimbursement Act do not apply. Health system impact assessment, including the impact on the public payer's budget The Health System Impact Assessment consists of two important parts. Firstly, in the analysis of the effect on the payer' s budget, it allows to estimate the potential costs related to the financing of a new therapy from public funds. The estimates of the costs associated with the new therapy (tomorrow scenario) are comparable to what we currently spend on the treatment of a given health problem (today' s scenario). On this basis, it is possible to assess whether the new treatment will be able to cope with the increase in costs, or whether it will be necessary to allocate more funds to the treatment in the budget. The second part of the HIA addresses the question of how the decision to fund a new therapy may affect the organisation of the provision of services (particularly",

It is currently the only inhibitor of Kras G12c approved by the European Medicines Agency, at a dosage of 960 mg/day PO, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. As the biology of lung cancer has become known, new drugs have been developed that act on specific components of the cancer. These drugs are called biologic or targeted therapeutics. These mutations initiate the oncogenic process and activate signaling pathways that the tumour needs to survive. Blocking this signaling can induce apoptosis and tumour regression. This is the framework for the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced CPNPC with mutated KRAS G12C, oral therapeutics and with the possibility of sequential use after chemotherapy or immunotherapy. In case of progression, the second line of treatment for advanced cPNPC consists of docetaxel monotherapy, or with pemetrex or docetaxil + nitendanib combination, or PD-L1 inhibitors such as nivolumab, pembrozolizumab or pentotubes, followed by discontinuous tubulination of the tubule, which reduces the activity of docopib, and a decrease in its activity of an anti-tubulin agent, which is a reducing agent in the circulatory system.
