(1 vs 2 vs 2), race (Asian vs non-Asian) and history of central nervous system (CNS) involvement (present or absent). Previous therapeutic lines were evaluated using the criteria: chemoradiation for locally advanced and incurable disease is considered a therapy line for advanced disease if progression occurs within 6 months after the end of treatment. Chemo-radiation followed by planned systemic therapy (including checkpoint inhibitor) or vice versa with no documented intervening progression is considered 1 therapy line if the progression occurred within six months after end-of-treatment. Adjuvant therapy line is considered to be a therapy for advanced illness if progressive disease occurs in the 6 months following end of local treatment. Each systemic treatment line for progressive metastatic disease and irresolvable metastases is considered an intertherapy line or new therapy regimen is not considered a maintenance therapy line.
