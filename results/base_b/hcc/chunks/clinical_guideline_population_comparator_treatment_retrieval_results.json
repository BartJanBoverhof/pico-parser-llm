Of course, the limited availability of donor organs also plays an important role. The available analyses are mainly based on morphometric criteria, i.e. the number and size of tumour nodes. In the case of purely hepatic infection, the risk of recurrence after liver transplantation is correlated with the number (maximum or cumulative) size of existing tumours [151]. The so-called Milan criteria are used as the standard established criterion for the indication for liver transplant in most countries, as well as in Germany [152]. Patients with an unstable HCC within the Milan criteria have a 5-year survival rate of 65 - 80% and an HCCR rate of approximately 10-12% after liver transplants, [153] Therefore, the Milan criterion accepted in Germany also represents a high priority for planning liver transplantations every 3 months. If these criteria continue to be met, the corresponding matchMELD will be upgraded every 3 months.",

Retrospective analyses have shown that TACE outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival can be improved by further differentiating the indication within the criteria of BC BLC stage. In particular, the size and number of tumour cores and the severity of the dysfunction are of minor importance. The vascularisation of the tumour core plays an important role in the outcome of TACE. Pseudoencapsulation suggests better outcomes than in poorly vascularized and diffuse arterially supplied tumours. Tumor sites at the 'water gap' between arterial supply territories also present increased demands on the interventional treatment technique. This involves high quality intraprocedural imaging, possibly including cone beam CT under arterial perfusion to clarify selective vascularisation. The greater the selectivity of transarterial therapy and the more pronounced and comprehensive the devascularizing effect of the embolization measures, the better the efficacy of TACE and the lesser the side-effect.",

The primary endpoint of survival at 6 months was 54% for mFOLFOX and 44% for mLFOLFIRI, the difference was not statistically significant [778].The combination of irinotecan and capecitabine resulted in a prolongation of mOS (10.1 vs 7.3 months) at a 9-month survival rate of 60.9% vs 32% [779] in a randomized Phase II study from China of 60 patients after progression on gemcitabine and cisplatin compared to irinotecin monotherapy in a nine-month study from South Korea of 59 patients in each arm.These results were confirmed by the NIFTY study in South Korea in 178 patients.

Of course, the limited availability of donor organs also plays an important role. The available analyses are mainly based on morphometric criteria, i.e. the number and size of tumour nodes. In the case of purely hepatic infection, the risk of recurrence after liver transplantation is correlated with the number (maximum or cumulative) size of existing tumours [151]. The so-called Milan criteria are used as the standard established criterion for the indication for liver transplant in most countries, as well as in Germany [152]. Patients with an unstable HCC within the Milan criteria have a 5-year survival rate of 65 - 80% and an HCCR rate of approximately 10-12% after liver transplants, [153] Therefore, the Milan criterion accepted in Germany also represents a high priority for planning liver transplantations every 3 months.

Retrospective analyses have shown that TACE outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival can be improved by further differentiating the indication within the criteria of BC BLC stage. In particular, the size and number of tumour cores and the severity of the dysfunction are of minor importance. The vascularisation of the tumour core plays an important role in the outcome of TACE. Pseudoencapsulation suggests better outcomes than in poorly vascularized and diffuse arterially supplied tumours. Tumor sites at the 'water gap' between arterial supply territories also present increased demands on the interventional treatment technique. This involves high quality intraprocedural imaging, possibly including cone beam CT under arterial perfusion to clarify selective vascularisation. The greater the selectivity of transarterial therapy and the more pronounced and comprehensive the devascularizing effect of the embolization measures, the better the efficacy of TACE and the lesser the side-effect.",

Other recent key references (72, 73). Liver transplantation should be reserved for patients with 5-year survival comparable to that of non-HCC patients, i.e. approximately 70%. Prognosis is assessed primarily on the basis of the diameter of the largest tumour and the number of tumours in the liver. There must be no extrahepatic tumour. Microinvasion is a very poor prognostic sign and there is some correlation to tumour size and number as well as certain biomarkers; however, there are no reliable, either radiological or biomarker methods to detect microinvision, which is why microbial invasion is not yet included in the selection of liver transplants. However, if one could use multiple criteria to validate the prognosis of patients with micro-transplantation, we will be able to use a better prognosis for those patients with non-AFPs (see below).",

The screening involves deciding at what level the risk of HCC should be high enough to trigger screening, what screening test to carry out and how often it should be carried out. Finally, deciding what action an abnormal screen test should trigger. The risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis over a period of 5 years is about 7%. Since some groups of patients with Chronic Hepatitis B have an increased incidence of hepatocell carcinomas (hCC) even without having developed cirrhotic disease, screening for HCC should be performed in patients who have a family history of HCC, Asian patients over 40-50 years of age, and African patients over the age of 25 years.",

Surveillance with abdominal ultrasound should be offered to individuals at high risk for developing HCC. Accurate diagnosis, staging, and liver function are crucial when determining the optimal therapeutic approach. The BCLC staging system is widely endorsed in Western countries. Managing this pathology requires a multidisciplinary, personalized approach, generally with a multimodal strategy. Surgery remains the only curative option, albeit local and systemic therapy may also increase survival when surgery is not suitable.

Recommendations are graded in 3 categories according to the level of evidence of data found in the literature.Results: The diagnosis and staging of HCC is essentially based on clinical, biological and imaging features. A pathological analysis obtained by a biopsy of tumoral and non-tumoral liver is rec- ommended. HCCs can be divided into 2 groups, taking into account not only the tumor stage, but also liver function. HCCs accessible to curative treatments are tumors that are in Milan criteria or with an AFP score ≤ 2, mainly treated by surgical resection, local ablation or liver transplantation. Intermediate and advanced HCCs with no liver insufﬁciency, accessible only to palliative treatments, beneﬁt from TACE, SIRT or systemic therapy according to the presence or absence of macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread.

Several observational studies, including some Italian ones, have given results consistent with the Asian data, confirming that half-yearly surveillance4 (level of evidence 2++) is effective in cirrhotic patients (considered at risk for annual incidence of HCC at around 2-45.6%) (Class of Evidence 2++). Advanced age (over 70-75) is not in itself a reason not to recommend periodic monitoring, as it does not preclude subsequent treatment8 (Level of Evidence 2+). The addition of periodic alpha-fetoprotein dosing to ultrasound surveillance does not substantially increase (approximately 6%) the rate of recognition of HCC at an early stage and significantly worsens the cost-effectiveness of surveillance, increasing the number of false positives (Leval of Evidences 2+) However, monitoring of the semihyperfetoma may not reduce the patient's risk of hypersensitivity to monitoring, except in the absence of available instruments. However, it remains an indicator of the risk of developing HCC and should be dosed at the time of detection of a focal liver lesion on cirrhosis to contribute to the diagnostic and prognostic framework.",

Diagnosis and treatment of portal hypertension and cirrhosis complications should be viewed and conducted in the perspective of the individual patient's entire disease. When diagnosed with HCC, 70 to 80% of patients have cirrhotic liver disease, which is not infrequently unknown and compensated, where HCC may be the first symptom of a previously unknown cirrosis.

In HCC < 3 cm, local ablation is a good alternative as primary treatment, if technically appropriate and there is no need for histopathology. When ablation isn't appropriate due to localization or tumor size, but liver function is well preserved, resection is recommended. In case of multiple tumors or recurrence of HCC (no local recurrence) after previous resection or ablation, liver transplantation should be considered [230], as the risk of recurrence is lower after transplantation.
