Nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab each lead to a significant prolongation in overall survival compared with docetaxel and also to a significant reduction in side effects. Accordingly, the guidelines regularly prefer immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. However, PD-L1 negative tumours are a fundamental exception. In these cases, the guidelines predominantly do not recommend a regular preference of immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, in PD-L1 negative tumours, alternative cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are also determined as an appropriate comparator therapy for the immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Standard of care treatment for KRAS G12C mutated NSCLC is currently the same as for patients with nontargetable mutations. This includes PD-(L)1 inhibitors (with or without platinum chemotherapy) for first-line (1L)\ntreatment of advanced NSCLC. Nearly all patients progress on these treatments and receive limited benefit from\nSOC cytotoxic chemotherapy treatments in subsequent lines of therapy. Most patients experience a decline in\nperformance status during 1L therapy that limits their tolerance for and the effect of second line and beyond\n(2L+) chemotherapy.

Health economic analysis demonstrates that sotorasib is a more effective and more costly treatment option compared to docetaxel that would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 750,000 DKK per QALY. The interpretation of the current clinical evidence is somewhat limited by the current lack of a direct comparison between sotorasib and docetaxel.",

In the absence of direct comparative data, whereas clinically relevant comparators were available, and of major methodological limitations of the indirect comparison provided, the Commission considered that the data did not allow a relatively unbiased assessment of the contribution of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) in the claimed indication, relative to the clinical relevance of the comparators. In support of its request for re-evaluation, the laboratory provided the results of the Phase III study requested by the Commission in its initial opinion. e laboratory also provided additional data from the ATUc Final Report, the 1st Early Access Synthesis Report and an observational study based on the ATuc.",

It should be emphasised that, in this context where no comparative data of acceptable methodological quality are available to ensure the robustness of the conclusion on the effect of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) treatment, the introduction of this medicinal product into the therapeutic strategy is accompanied by a greater risk-taking than for medicinal products whose efficacy is based on a comparison with an adapted methodology.",

Sotorasib is a selective inhibitor of KRAS G12C (the homolog of the Kirsten rat meat viral oncogene) which binds covalently and irreversibly to a specific KRAS-G12C cysteine. Inactivation of KRas G12c by sotorasibs blocks cancer cell signalling and survival, inhibits cell growth and selectively induces apoptosis in tumours containing the KRas mutation, a factor that stimulates oncogenesis.
