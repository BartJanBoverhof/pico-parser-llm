Managing this pathology requires a multidisciplinary, personalized approach, generally with a multimodal strategy.

In general conditions and co-morbidity, see treatment algorithm Figure 4 Overview of treatment principles in Sweden. In the case of hepatic impairment or limited multifocal disease, liver transplantation is preferable, but requires limited comorbidity. In large singular tumor, liver resection is often possible, but presupposes good liver function. In established HCC less than 3 cm, ablation is the first choice, thanks to good tolerability and low complication rate, which can allow treatment even for fragile patients. In choosing between resection or ablation, several factors must be weighed in addition to size, such as localization, co- morbidity and hepatic function. Ablation with increased risk of local recurrence, but it should be weighted against the possibility of reintervention, lower morbidities and cost [227-229].",
