The median months to clinically meaningful worsening for the EQ-5D health utility index (HUI) and visual analogue scale (VAS) domains were numerically higher and in favour of the lenvatinib arm, but were nonsignificant (P > 0.05) (8). For most domains, the impact on HRQoL was generally similar between lenvatinib and sorafenib. There\nwere no nominally significant improvements in any of the HRQoL domains with sorafenib compared to lenvatinib.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is newly diagnosed in an estimated 560,000 people per year, worldwide.1 In the Netherlands, a total of 1964 patients with hepatocellulose cancer were registered in the period 1989-2000 (1964/12 = 164/year).2 The male-female ratio was 2.4:1. In 2000, the standardized incidence was 1.6/100,000 men and 0.3/100,000 women. There was no increase over time. Risk factors in Europe are: hepatitis C (60-70%), alcohol consumption (20%), hepatitis B (10-15%) and other (10%). In a European study covering 1990-1994, the 5-year survival rate for the Netherlands was 7% and the 1-year survivorship rate was 22%.2 Stage classification. Several factors are important for the prognosis and thus for the indication for treatment, including tumour size, degree of tumour spread, liver function (Child-Pugh stage), the general physical condition of the patient (performance status; PS), and symptoms associated with cancer.",

The choice of allocation is based on good statistical fit to the KM estimate as measured by AIC and BIC and good visual fit. To model the Lenvima PFS, the company applies a constant hazard quotient of [---] (--[--]) to the Stride PFS curve. TLV estimates that there are uncertainties in the company' s modelling of OS and chooses to adjust the extrapolation of OS. This is described in the paragraphs below. In TLV' s baseline scenario, OS is extrapolated with the Hazard 1 distribution in both treatment arms. This means that a lower proportion of patients survive over time compared to the company ' s ex-trapolation. TLV presents susceptibility analyses in which OS is extrapolated to other distributions and presents a susceptability analysis in which the time horizon is shortened to ten years. In the TLV and the company' s extrapolation of OS, STRIDE has an efficacy advantage compared to sorafenib long-term follow-up in HIMALAYA. The company has shown that the risk of death in the respective STRIDES and phenibs during the subsequent follow up period is consistent with the KM estimate for the study comparison arm.",
