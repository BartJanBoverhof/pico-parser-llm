Fazit der Autoren: This review included only trial participants with\nintermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (i.e. BCLCB stage; i.e. large,\nmultinodular, Child-Pugh status A to B, and performance status 0). Therefore, this review is applicable only to people with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. It included a mixture of viral and non-viral\naetiologies and people with cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic livers. Hence, the\nreview is applicable to viral or non-viral aetiologies and people with cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic livers. None of the trials reported the proportion\nof people with portal hypertension. Therefore, it is not clear whether the\nfindings of the review are applicable in people with portal hypertension. 5.

By contrast, there was a hint of lesser benefit for the cognitive functioning dimension of health-related quality of life. Furthermore, it must be noted that no usable data are available for the selection of specific AEs. In this situation, it is conceivable that the overall conclusion on added benefit may change materially if the missing information became available, since the presented event rates also reveal potential disadvantages of lenvatinib. For this reason, it is not possible to adequately weigh all positive and negative effects of lenvatinib. For research question 1, an added benefit of lenvatinib is therefore not proven.

By contrast, there was a hint of lesser benefit for the cognitive functioning dimension of health-related quality of life. Furthermore, it must be noted that no usable data are available for the selection of specific AEs. In this situation, it is conceivable that the overall conclusion on added benefit may change materially if the missing information became available, since the presented event rates also reveal potential disadvantages of lenvatinib. For this reason, it is not possible to adequately weigh all positive and negative effects of lenvatinib. For research question 1, an added benefit of lenvatinib is therefore not proven. No relevant study was found for research question 2. An added benefit of lenvatinib is therefore not proven for this research question.",

Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor which reduces tumour cell proliferation in vitro. It inhibits the growth of\nvarious human cancerous tumours in a mouse model of renal cell carcinoma, which is accompanied by a reduction in tumour angiogenesis. Sorafenib inhibits the activity of target enzymes/factors located in the\ntumour cell and in the tumour vasculature. In line with the Summary of Product Characteristics, Nexavar is indicated in the treatment of:\n• hepatocellular carcinoma;\n• patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who have failed prior interferon-alpha or interleukin-2\nbased therapy or are considered unsuitable for such therapy;\n• patients with progressive, locally advanced or metastatic, differentiated (papillary/follicular/Hürthle\ncell) thyroid carcinoma, refractory to radioactive iodine.",

It is the 6th most common worldwide, being responsible for a large number of deaths. HCCs occur in 90% of situations in a cirrhosis context, with the main risk factors in the Western world being hepatitis C virus infection and alcoholism. In the Eastern world there is a high prevalence of hepatitis B (which has been shown to have a direct oncogenic effect). In Portugal, for 2015 and based on the ROR-Sul data, it is estimated that about 360 new cases have been diagnosed nationally. The standardized rate for age (European standard population) is 4.26/100,000 and 0.26/100.000 respectively for men and women. Based on this Portuguese population of 10 million inhabitants, the number of new cases will be approximately 452 patients. Considering that 32% of these patients will have advanced CHC 145 and 57% of them will not initiate treatment, lenvatinib will be studied for 62.",
