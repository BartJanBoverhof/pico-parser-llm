However, if patients are over 65 years of age, the indication for liver transplantation should be examined particularly carefully. More strongly, chronological age does not constitute a contraindication for a liver transplant [177], [178], biological age being the decisive factor. Chronological age per se does not constitute a contraindication for liver transplantation [177], [178], biological age is more decisive.

However, if patients are over 65 years of age, the indication for liver transplantation should be examined particularly carefully. More strongly, chronological age does not constitute a contraindication for a liver transplant [177], [178], biological age being the decisive factor. Chronological age per se does not constitute a contraindication for liver transplantation [177], [178], biological age is more decisive.

The screening involves deciding at what level the risk of HCC should be high enough to trigger screening, what screening test to carry out and how often it should be carried out. Finally, deciding what action an abnormal screen test should trigger. The risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis over a period of 5 years is about 7%. Since some groups of patients with Chronic Hepatitis B have an increased incidence of hepatocell carcinomas (hCC) even without having developed cirrhotic disease, screening for HCC should be performed in patients who have a family history of HCC, Asian patients over 40-50 years of age, and African patients over the age of 25 years.",

The 5-year survival after resection for HCC is 35-50% in newer large cohorts (66). The long-term survival for small solitary HCC < 5 cm in diameter is close to 70% (67, 68). The risk of recurrence during the first 5 years after radical resection of HCC, for example, is in the order of 50-80% (69). There is no evidence for adjuvant chemotherapy after liver resection (70). The most effective way of prolonging the survival of patients with re-resection, ablation and/ or transarteriolymbolisation (TACE) is shown to be regressive treatment with regressive re-section and ablation.",

Managing this pathology requires a multidisciplinary, personalized approach, generally with a multimodal strategy.

In general conditions and co-morbidity, see treatment algorithm Figure 4 Overview of treatment principles in Sweden. In the case of hepatic impairment or limited multifocal disease, liver transplantation is preferable, but requires limited comorbidity. In large singular tumor, liver resection is often possible, but presupposes good liver function. In established HCC less than 3 cm, ablation is the first choice, thanks to good tolerability and low complication rate, which can allow treatment even for fragile patients. In choosing between resection or ablation, several factors must be weighed in addition to size, such as localization, co- morbidity and hepatic function. Ablation with increased risk of local recurrence, but it should be weighted against the possibility of reintervention, lower morbidities and cost [227-229].",

The goal is to be able to offer curative targeted treatment when the tumor is limited to the liver, and where liver function and comorbidity are not contraindicated. In HCC < 3 cm, local ablation is a good alternative as primary treatment, if technically appropriate and there is no need for histopathology. When ablation isn't appropriate due to localization or tumor size, but liver function is well preserved, resection is recommended. In case of multiple tumors or recurrence of HCC (no local recurrence) after previous resection or ablation, liver transplantation should be considered [230], as the risk of recurrence is lower after transplantation.
