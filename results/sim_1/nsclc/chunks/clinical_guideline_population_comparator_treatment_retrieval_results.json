The treatment for oncogene-driven NSCLC is under rapid development and many new drugs are approved annually by the FDA (fast-track) and often subsequently by the EMA. This development should also include Danish patients, which calls for a joint Danish effort and monitoring, in close cooperation with the Medical Council (MR). This guidelines is an attempt to compile and update the new knowledge and approvals within the field, FDA and EMA, within the MR field. Patients with oncogene-driven NSCLC generally have a better prognosis than the other patients with N SCLC. The patient group often has fewer comorbidities and no or sporadic spinal cancers (common for the non-KRAS G12C variant) compared to the other group of patients with the same N ScLC. Oncogene cancers, however, may occur in all patients with spinal adenocarcinoma or should therefore be investigated independently of the broad genomic profile of NSCSCLC. In addition, genomic profiling of tumours from patients with young-age planocellular carcinoma or patients with planucellular cancer combined with sparse or negative smoking history should be considered.",

Sotorasib is a targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation. Sotorasib has only been indirectly compared with current treatment. The results suggest\nthat, after platinum-based chemotherapy, sotorasib increases the time before the cancer gets worse and how long people live compared with current treatment. Sotorasib likely meets NICE's criteria to be a life-extending treatment at the end of life. But\nthere is uncertainty in the clinical evidence. Sotorasib has the potential to be cost\neffective, but more evidence is needed to address the uncertainties before it can be recommended for routine use. The evidence on sotorasib is promising. But, more data is being collected from the primary\nclinical trial and from an ongoing randomised controlled trial comparing sotorasib with docetaxel. Collecting additional data through the Cancer Drugs Fund may resolve some\nuncertainty in the clinical evidence. So, sotorasib is recommended for use in the Cancer\nDrugs Fund. © NICE 2024.

These include RET, MET, HER2, KRAS and NTRK. RET fusions are seen in 12% of patients with N SCLC. The activity of multikinase inhibitors, such as kabozantinib, vandetanib, sunitinib, sorafenib and alektinib, has varied in early studies with response rates ranging from 16 to 47%. Pralsetinib is a more specific RET inhibitor that was recently approved for treatment in patients with RET-fusion-positive advanced NSCSCLC who have not previously been treated with an RET blocker. Intracranial response was seen in 5/9 patients with CNS metastases. Pralsetinib is available for subsidised prescription but is likely to be deregistered for use in Europe in the autumn of 2024. This is not based on lack of efficacy but on the transfer of the marketing authorisation to other pharmaceutical companies that do not intend to continue marketing the preparation in Europe. Selperkatinib is another novel RET inhibitor which in Phase I/II studies (LIBRETTO-001) resulted in a response rate of 64% in patients with RET infusion-positive advanced NSCLC and previous cytostatic therapy, and 85% in previously untreated patients [250]. Based on the above, treatment with pralsetinib or selperkatinib is recommended in RET-fusion-positive advanced NSCLC in patients who have not previously received a RET inhibitor.",

To distinguish epithelial primary malignancies in the lung from non-epithelials, metastases or reactive changes (including inflammatory and infectious conditions) can be very difficult, sometimes impossible, on biopsy/cytology.",
