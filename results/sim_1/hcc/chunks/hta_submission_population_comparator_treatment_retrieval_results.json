By contrast, there was a hint of lesser benefit for the cognitive functioning dimension of health-related quality of life. Furthermore, it must be noted that no usable data are available for the selection of specific AEs. In this situation, it is conceivable that the overall conclusion on added benefit may change materially if the missing information became available, since the presented event rates also reveal potential disadvantages of lenvatinib. For this reason, it is not possible to adequately weigh all positive and negative effects of lenvatinib. For research question 1, an added benefit of lenvatinib is therefore not proven.

Additionally, 121 of the 156 patients that received an anticancer medication postprogression on lenvatinib received sorafenib2. This imbalance in treatment with new agents is an\nartifact of clinical trial design rather than reflective of clinical practice.  In the overall population, the HR (95% CI) for lenvatinib versus sorafenib was 0.87 (0.75,\n1.01) in the adjusted analysis (post-hoc analysis of OS results adjusted by use of posttreatment anti-cancer therapy) compared with 0.92 (0.79, 1.06) in the unadjusted analysis\n Furthermore, as per the exploratory analysis provided in the response document3, lenvatinib first-line followed by any subsequent anti-cancer medication demonstrated a longer OS than\nsorafenib followed by any subsequent anti-cancer medication. Patients who received any\nsubsequent medication had a 4-month OS benefit if they began on lenvatinib vs sorafenib (21 vs 17 months)\nThese results also confirm that the direction of imbalance in subsequent therapies is likely to have biased OS in favour of sorafenib.",

Overall, HCC patients are categorized into those with early HCC who benefit from curative therapy, those with intermediate and advanced disease who have benefited from palliative treatments, and finally patients who have terminal disease who are offered symptomatic treatment.[3] Patients with early disease (BCLCC A) are evaluated for surgical removal of the tumor, liver transplantation or percutaneous ablation (destruction of cancer cells by means of subtle chemotherapy or hyper-hypothermia, where in particular radiofrequency (RFA) therapy has been introduced in Denmark) with the possibility of five-year recovery, and have a high incidence of hepatohepatitis over five years, and do not have symptoms and are still dependent on interstitial treatment.[3] About 50-75 percent of the patients with BCC who respond to this treatment have no symptoms or no symptoms are still undergoing treatment with liver cancer (BBCLC A, BCLC A) or in childhood cancer.[3]",

It noted from the clinical studies that life expectancy without sorafenib was unlikely to be greater than 24 months and was potentially as low as 7.9 months, although the latter was based on SHARP, which was stopped early. The committee considered that evidence from the clinical studies of sorafenib plus best supportive care suggested that it increased median survival by more than 2.8 months compared with placebo plus best supportive care, and the company's economic model predicted a mean gain in overall survival of 6.1 months, although this depended on the method of extrapolation.

Clinical effectiveness (NICE technology apprais guidance 189) 4.5 The committee considered the clinical effectiveness data presented by the company. It noted that evidence from the clinical studies of sorafenib plus best supportive care suggested that it increased median survival by more than 2.8 months compared with placebo plus best supportive care. The committee also noted that there was a statistically significant difference in median time to radiological disease progression for patients in the sorafenib group compared with the placebo group. The committee was aware that there was an extension in time to disease progression of 11.7 weeks according to independent assessment or 5.1 weeks according to investigator assessment, compared with placebo.

In stage B or intermediate (includes patients with multinodular tumours that do not meet the criteria described above, without vascular or extrahepatic invasion, with preserved hepatic function and general condition) transarterial chemoembolization is the main treatment option. Stage D or terminal BCLC includes patients with Child- Pugh C or Child-Pugh B with decompensations associated with poor prognosis such as refractory ascites, recurrent hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, etc. They are characterised by deterioration of general condition and/or severely impaired hepatic function with median survival not exceeding four months and where the only therapeutic option is best supportive care (8-10 years).",

According to the latest available data, globally, HCC ranks seventh in incidence and fourth in direct mortality from cancer (1). The incidence of HCC increases with age (exceptionally it occurs before 40 years and the median age at diagnosis in our midst is between 65-70 years), being more frequent in men than in women (2). The rate of incidence is higher in western and south-eastern Africa, where the main etiological factors are hepatitis B and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection.",

Unlike other solid tumors, for which the therapeutic decision is made based on the TNM classification, there is no consensus prognostic classification for HCC7. Therefore, several classifications or scores have been proposed including the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 8 classification which has the advantage of enabling a prognosis stratification and proposing a treatment algorithm. When HCC is at an early stage (BC 0-A), patients are generally eligible for curative treatment by surgery, radiosurgery or transplantation. In case of failure, refractory disease or ineligibility for TACE, or in the presence of vascular invasion and/ or extrahepatic injury (advanced stage CLC), treatment with sorafenib is recommended in patients with preserved general condition (ECOG ≤ 2) and preserved hepatic function (Child-Pugh A). In adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (stage BCLC B or C) who have not received prior systemic therapy, the medical need is therefore considered to be partially met by sorafenib. However, there remains a medical need for better tolerated and/ or more effective treatments at this stage of the disease.",

As these may mainly involve fatigue, bleeding and abdominal pain, most of the patients studied had a Child-Pugh stage liver failure, there are limited data on safety and tolerability in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Experience According to the Periodic Safety Update Report for the first half of 2007, 19,086 patients were treated during that period (8740 commercially and 10,346 in clinical trials). 1The term \" adverse reactions\" refers to complaints and symptoms regardless of cause. Clinical pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely with concomitant use of agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 (midazolam, dextromethorphan, omeprazole). It cannot be excluded that sorafenib increases the concentrations of co-administered P-gp substrates (such as digoxin), CYP2B6 (like bupropion, cyclophosphamide, efavirenz, metronidazole), CYP8C2 (like paclitaxel, amodiaquine, repaglinide), or CYP2C9 (like acetoacetylsalicylate).

Comparative treatment choice The standard treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma depends on the stage of the disease in which they are. There are 3 stages to be distinguished.3 - In the early stage, intentionally curative treatment is indicated in the form of resection, transplantation or ablation. - At the next stage, patients may benefit from locoregional or local palliative treatment (not to be confused with palliate care). 2 groups of patients are distinguished. One is formed by patients with localized disease who have no remaining symptoms, sufficient function and good renal condition; they may be eligible for transarterial vascular embolism. The other group consists of patients presenting with liver tumors, or symptoms, outside the chorionic phase.",

TLV assumes that Lenvima treatment can be continued after progression, which is the same as the assumption made for STRIDE and sorafenib. TLV assumed that 40 percent of patients receive follow-up treatment. After treatment with Stride, half of the patients are assumed to receive soraphenib and half of those patients are considered to be receiving sorafenima. Patients treated with first-line Lenven or Lenven are equally divided between Stivarga (regorafenib) and Cabometyx (kabozantinib). TLV presents sensitivity analyses with other assumptions about follow-on treatments. The Company reports a cost comparison between STRIDE and Tecentriq plus bevacizumab. The Company' s cost comparisons include drug and drug administration costs. Based on the indirect comparison reported by the Company (see section 2.4.2), it is assumed that treatment with Tecentrq + bevazizumab would result in a longer progression-free survival compared to STRIDES. Therefore, drug and medication administration costs are calculated according to the PFS curves for the respective treatments.",

In Sweden, patients are treated first-line with sorafenib or lenvatinib if atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is not appropriate. However, according to the TLV Clinical Expert, an equivalent efficacy of sorefenib/lenvatinib is expected irrespective of patients' suitability for atezoizumab + bevaziumab.

The company ' s modeling of the PFS and duration of treatment (TTD curve, see more in section 3.2.1) for STRIDA also imply that after a period, the percentage of patients are progress- free is [--]. TLV adjusts the extrapolated PFS curve to STRIDS by assuming the risk for progressing in both treatment cycles is the same at 35 months, which coincides with the 10th time point of the STRIDIE and KM curve (see KM Curve for PFS).

TLV considers that it is reasonable to assume that the relative efficacy benefit of STRIDE compared to sorafenib begins to decrease gradually at 6 years. At 8 years, the risk of death is assumed to be the same in both treatment arms (HR=1). At these time points, only a small proportion of patients are still progression-free and on treatment according to extrapolated PFS and TTD curves (TTD, Time on Treatment). Approximately 97 percent have progressed by 6 years and approximately 2 percent are on treatment with STRIDA. TLV presents sensitivity analyses to show how the outcome is affected by other assumptions.

Based on these investigations, the company assumes that the proportionate hazards assumption is not rejected for OS in HIMALAYA, OS in IMbrave150 and PFS in IM Brave150. For PPS in HIMALAYA the company considers that it is difficult to draw conclusive conclusions on the proportional risks assumption and therefore the results of the indirect comparison must be interpreted with caution.
