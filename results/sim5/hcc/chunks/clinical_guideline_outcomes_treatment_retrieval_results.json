Surveillance with abdominal ultrasound should be offered to individuals at high risk for developing HCC. Accurate diagnosis, staging, and liver function are crucial when determining the optimal therapeutic approach. The BCLC staging system is widely endorsed in Western countries. Managing this pathology requires a multidisciplinary, personalized approach, generally with a multimodal strategy. Surgery remains the only curative option, albeit local and systemic therapy may also increase survival when surgery is not suitable.
