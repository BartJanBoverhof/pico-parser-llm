In TLV' s baseline scenario with sorafenig as comparator, the cost per QALY is approximately SEK 2.4 million. In the comparison with Lenvimi, the costs per QAlY are about SEK 1.7 million. The TLV cost comparison between STRIDE and Te centriq plus Bevacizumb shows that the high cost of treatment for STRIDI is approximately $490,000 higher than the cost of the comparator alternative. The result in TLV: cost comparator is based on the assumption of comparable efficacy in OS and PFS and the time horizon is assumed to be [---] months.",
