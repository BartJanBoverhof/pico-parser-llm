It is the 6th most common worldwide, being responsible for a large number of deaths. HCCs occur in 90% of situations in a cirrhosis context, with the main risk factors in the Western world being hepatitis C virus infection and alcoholism. In the Eastern world there is a high prevalence of hepatitis B (which has been shown to have a direct oncogenic effect). In Portugal, for 2015 and based on the ROR-Sul data, it is estimated that about 360 new cases have been diagnosed nationally. The standardized rate for age (European standard population) is 4.26/100,000 and 0.26/100.000 respectively for men and women. Based on this Portuguese population of 10 million inhabitants, the number of new cases will be approximately 452 patients. Considering that 32% of these patients will have advanced CHC 145 and 57% of them will not initiate treatment, lenvatinib will be studied for 62.",

For patients whose HCC has a non-viral etiology, the company reports an analysis comparing STRIDE with Tecentriq plus bevacizumab. The analysis is a cost-benefit analysis using the same type of model as compared to sorafenib and Lenvima respectively. Section 4.1.2 presents the result of the company' s comparison against Tecentrq plusbevacizumb for patients with HCC having a non viral etiology. TLV considers that it is reasonable to assume comparable efficacy between STRIDE and Tecentriq plus bevacizumab and therefore makes a cost comparison.",
