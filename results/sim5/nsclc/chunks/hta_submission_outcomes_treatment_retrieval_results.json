Standard of care treatment for KRAS G12C mutated NSCLC is currently the same as for patients with nontargetable mutations. This includes PD-(L)1 inhibitors (with or without platinum chemotherapy) for first-line (1L)\ntreatment of advanced NSCLC. Nearly all patients progress on these treatments and receive limited benefit from\nSOC cytotoxic chemotherapy treatments in subsequent lines of therapy. Most patients experience a decline in\nperformance status during 1L therapy that limits their tolerance for and the effect of second line and beyond\n(2L+) chemotherapy.

The clinical expert mentioned that in clinical practice, docetaxel is not expected to be better than docetaxel plus nintedanib in the first 6 months. The clinical expert also highlighted that nintedanib has greater toxicity so more people may stop treatment earlier, but added that this is unlikely to be a major driver. The company suggested a possible explanation of the curve could be that nintedanib is anti-angiogenic, so it prevents the formation of blood vessels that support tumour growth.

In general TLV considers that indirect comparisons have a lower evidence value than direct comparison studies because they are associated with greater uncertainties.
