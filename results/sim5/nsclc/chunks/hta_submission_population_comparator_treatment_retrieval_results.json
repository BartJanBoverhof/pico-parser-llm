Nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab each lead to a significant prolongation in overall survival compared with docetaxel and also to a significant reduction in side effects. Accordingly, the guidelines regularly prefer immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. However, PD-L1 negative tumours are a fundamental exception. In these cases, the guidelines predominantly do not recommend a regular preference of immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, in PD-L1 negative tumours, alternative cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are also determined as an appropriate comparator therapy for the immune checkpoint inhibitors. For ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel, no additional benefit was shown",

A total of 447 requests for access to treatment were made during this period, 7 of which were refused. Of the 440 accepted requests, 414 patients were considered to be treated (drug provided by the laboratory). Of these, 403 were deemed to be exposed (11 patients who had never considered the treatment). The majority of the 414 treated patients were active smokers (52%) and 66% of the patients (8%) were men. The most frequent metastatic locations were pulmonary (51%), adrenal (50%) and bone (41%). Notably, 10% of patients had active central nervous system metastases, and 20% non-active metastasis. The median number of anterior lines received was 2 (min-max: 0-9). The other patients had 1 anterior line (43%), 2 anterior lines (31%), 3 anterior lines (16%) or 4 anterior lines and more (10%).",

Globally, only 18% of patients will be alive 5 years or more after diagnosis of the disease. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage (not curable), so the incidence and mortality figures are very similar. The WHO estimates that in Portugal 5284 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed in 2020, representing the third most frequent neoplasm in the country (fourth in women). The estimated prevalence of the disease over a period of 5 years is 5 304 cases. The National Oncological Registry data refer to 4 424 new tracheal and bronchial cancer cases in 2018. Among all KRAS mutations, the mono-nucleotide KRAS p.G12C variation, with glycine replaced by cysteine at codon 12, is the most frequent variant, with a prevalence of approximately 7-12% in CPNPC and 13% in adenocarcinomas.",
