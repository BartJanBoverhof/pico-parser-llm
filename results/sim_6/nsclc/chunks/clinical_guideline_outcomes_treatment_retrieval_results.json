Adagrsib is administered orally. The most common adverse reactions of all severities based on KRYSTAL-12 data are gastrointestinal with diarrhoea (53%), dilation (35%), and nausea (34%), hepatic with transaminase increase (30%) and renal with creatinine increase (20%). QTc time prolongation has also been reported. Afatinib is an irreversible inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinases and belongs to the second generation of TKIs in this indication. It is approved for the treatment of TKI-naïve patients with advanced NSCLC and activating EGFR mutations. Alectinib is an inhibitor of ALK and RET, belonging to the second generation ALK inhibitors. It is approved for the treatment of patients with advanced, ALK-positive NSCLC in the first line and in the second line after prior therapy with crizotinib. In addition, the EMA' s CHMP has currently issued a recommendation for the approval of alectinib in the adjuvant therapy for ALK positive NSCLL after complete resection and at high risk of recurrence. Amivantamab is a bispecific antibody against MET and EGFR. In NSCLC with EGFR mutation del19/ L858R, it is approved in combination with the TKI Lazertinib for untreated patients, and in conjunction with Carboplatin/ Pemetrexed in previously treated patients. Brigatinib is approved for the treatment of patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC in the first line and in the second line after prior therapy with crizotinib. alectinib is used as oral monotherapy. serious CTCAE grade 3/4 adverse reactions occurred in 61% to 69% of patients treated with brigatinib in the marketing authorisation study. Capmatinib is a MET inhibitor, approved in the EU from the second line for Pat. with a MES exon 14 skipping mutation. Capmatnib was withdrawn from the German market by the pharmaceutical company in September 2023.",

Diagnosis of therapy-relevant alterations should be carried out in all patients in stage IV prior to initiation of first-line drug therapy. It should capture these aberrations (in alphabetical order). ALK translocations BRAF V600E mutation EGFR exon 18-21 mutations HER2 mutations KRAS G12C mutation c-MET exon 14 skipping mutations NTRK translocations RET translokations ROS1 translocation Diagnosis should be performed on tissue. If insufficient material is available or the biopsy of an informative lesion is not justified due to the risk of puncture, a liquid biopsy is recommended. Early detection may be relevant for a necessary change of therapy in case of chemotherapy or immunotherapy intolerance or for rapid progression, possibly also for inclusion in a study. Molecular biology diagnostics should be targeted, comprehensive, tissue-sparing, integrated, quality assured and timely (≤10 working days). RNA sequencing has a higher sensitivity for gene fusions (ALK, RET, ROS, NTRK) as well as for the c-MET 14 exon skipping mutations compared to DNA-based diagnostics and therefore should be complementary or parallel. Progress under a targeted therapy should include the molecular analysis of the rebiopsy in addition to HER and MET2 gene amplifications. Treatment options in patients with lung cancer are often limited by reduced overall condition and cardiovascular, pulmonary or other co-morbidities, including age-related comorbidities. This applies to both curative and palliative therapy. Individual overall condition is commonly indicated in oncology by the ECOG Performance Score (PS), which is also used in the selection of patients for clinical trials.",

Lorlatinib resulted in a response rate of 62% in TKI-naïve patients and 35% in previously treated patients in an open-label Phase I/II study [125]. Lorlattinib is not approved for this indication in the EU. A new option is repotrectinib as an inhibitor of ROS1 and tropomyosin phase receptor tyrosine kinases. In the TRIDENT-ROS1 Fusion-positive study, 71 patients who had not previously been treated with TKI responded with a response of 79% and a median PFAS of 35.7 months. 10 out of 17 patients with the resistance mutation G2023R also responded to therapy; 8 out of 9 patients with cerebral metastases responded also to therapy with repotrectinib [33]. Following failure of first-line therapy, a rebiopsy should be sought. If a G2032R mutation is found in the ROS1 gene, repotrektinib is an option. After failure of targeted therapies, platinum- and pemetrexed-containing chemotherapy or a regimen as for non-targeted treatable NSCLC should be recommended, see Chapter 6.1. 6.2. 2. 1. the efficacy of immuno-checkpoint inhibitors in ROS1+ is not established 6.1.6.2.1.10 Other predictive genetic markers for targeted therapy in NSCLL Many other genetic aberrations can be identified including NRG translocations, MET Amplification, LTK1 mutations and atypical KRAS mutations with targeted options for clinical trials and early access programmes. This population comprises 70-80% of all patients with Stage IV NSCLC. The previous predictive significance of histological classification has been increasingly replaced by biological parameters.

For patients with non-plate epithelial NSCLC without a treatable driver mutation and in a palliative care setting, platinum-based combination chemotherapy with a pemetrexed-containing regimen followed by mono-maintenance therapy has been the standard first-line treatment until now. In recent years, immuno-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have been tested either as monotherapy or as combination therapy versus single chemotherapies in Phase II and III studies. The results of these studies have been largely unambiguous to the extent that ICI-based therapy replaces the current standard activated-heart lines with pacemakers and is well regulated by general immunostimulation (ECOG) and co-regulated by a number of other immune checkpoints and/ or cytotoxicity inhibitors. This complex construct controls itself under normal physiological conditions, but is manipulated during malignant transformation.[1016] Immune checkpoints, represented primarily by the surface proteins CTLA-4 and PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1, inhibit T cell function.",

In the retrospective inventories of patients with oncogene-driven NSCLC treated with immunotherapy alone IMMUNOTARGET (39) [2b] and in the Keynote 042 study (50) [1b] there was no difference in ORR and mPFS between patients with KRAS mutation and KRAS wild type.

The treatment for oncogene-driven NSCLC is under rapid development and many new drugs are approved annually by the FDA (fast-track) and often subsequently by the EMA. This development should also include Danish patients, which calls for a joint Danish effort and monitoring, in close cooperation with the Medical Council (MR). This guidelines is an attempt to compile and update the new knowledge and approvals within the field, FDA and EMA, within the MR field. Patients with oncogene-driven NSCLC generally have a better prognosis than the other patients with N SCLC. The patient group often has fewer comorbidities and no or sporadic spinal cancers (common for the non-KRAS G12C variant) compared to the other group of patients with the same N ScLC. Oncogene cancers, however, may occur in all patients with spinal adenocarcinoma or should therefore be investigated independently of the broad genomic profile of NSCSCLC. In addition, genomic profiling of tumours from patients with young-age planocellular carcinoma or patients with planucellular cancer combined with sparse or negative smoking history should be considered.

Treatment options are complex and based on genomic profiling of patients' tumours and/or free tumour DNA in blood (ctDNA). Understanding of the molecular biological mechanisms is developing rapidly following the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Progress is being made towards a treatment tailored to the individual gene defects (variants); an EGFR mutation must be treated completely differently depending on which protein alteration (variant) in the EGFR genome it causes (e.g. EGFR exon 19 versus EGFR 20 exon insertion). Due to studies of this disease, the understanding of the disease and the derivation of even more targeted biological treatments will be deepened, increasingly based on the evaluation of the efficacy of new class III drugs in our patient population. The treatment of this group of patients therefore requires close interdisciplinary collaboration between molecular biologists, pathologists and oncologists in understanding the clinical significance of the variants, preferably (if available) on molecular tumor boards (MDT).",

Sotorasib is a small-scale test that has been designed in accordance with the 6.6 percent post-treatment rate approved by the FDA and has been evaluated by the EMA during the 10th month of therapy and has received safety data from 59 patients who received treatment in the CRASG/ PFSB designated treatment group and were evaluated at 10 months of therapy. Additionally, another inhibitor that targets the KRAS p.G12C mutation, adagrasib, was tested in pretreated patients with MCS carrying the mutation and resulted in a median PFS of 6.5 months and median OS of 12.6 months.",

Sotorasib is a targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation. Sotorasib has only been indirectly compared with current treatment. The results suggest\nthat, after platinum-based chemotherapy, sotorasib increases the time before the cancer gets worse and how long people live compared with current treatment. Sotorasib likely meets NICE's criteria to be a life-extending treatment at the end of life. But\nthere is uncertainty in the clinical evidence. Sotorasib has the potential to be cost\neffective, but more evidence is needed to address the uncertainties before it can be recommended for routine use. The evidence on sotorasib is promising. But, more data is being collected from the primary\nclinical trial and from an ongoing randomised controlled trial comparing sotorasib with docetaxel.

The KRAS G12C mutation is the most common and occurs in 12% of nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours in the UK. This mutation is more\ncommon in non-squamous NSCLC and does not usually occur with other known mutations such as EGFR, ALK and ROS-1. These other known\nmutations may have targeted treatments available but there is currently no targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation. People with KRAS\nG12C mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC usually have chemotherapy, a non-targeted treatment associated with adverse\neffects that affect health-related quality of life. The clinical expert\nhighlighted that people with KRAS G12C mutation-positive NSCLC have a poor prognosis. The clinical and patient experts noted that there is an\nunmet need for effective and tolerable treatments in this population. They also highlighted that the lack of targeted treatment options can have a psychological impact.

A\nsupplementary analysis of sotorasib versus docetaxel was also done using a propensity score weighting analysis (PSWA) approach, using da\nfrom CodeBreaK100 for sotorasib and the chemotherapy arm of the\nAmgen Flatiron Health real-world evidence study. The committee\nconcluded that an indirect treatment comparison is appropriate becaus there are no head-to-head trials, but noted there were several issues\nwith the comparisons that introduced considerable uncertainty. Sotorasib increases overall and progression-free survival compared with docetaxel and docetaxel plus nintedanib i\nindirect comparison\n3.5 The indirect treatment comparison showed that sotorasib is statistically\nsuperior in overall and progression-free survival compared with docetaxel.",

Some covariates identified as 'very important' by clinical\nexperts were excluded from matching by the company because of missing data or trial differences. The ERG noted that excluding brain\nmetastases affected prognosis identified by subgroup analysis. The\ncompany mentioned that active brain metastasis was excluded from the trials. The proportion of people with brain metastases was higher in\nCodeBreaK100 than in LUME-Lung 1. The company stated that if the\nproportion of inactive brain metastases in SELECT-1 was similar to\nCodeBreaK100, any bias would favour the docetaxel arm and result in conservative results. The ERG highlighted that an analysis including\nKRAS mutation status would be informative. But, it acknowledged the\ncompany's reasoning that overall survival and progression-free survival are similar in the absence of targeted therapies in the overall KRAS and\nKRAS G12C-specific population. However, it explained that it could have\nbeen possible to select KRAS G12C mutation data from SELECT-1 data. The ERG considered that the company's supplementary analysis using a\nPSWA may be less biased than the MAIC. It explained that the Amgen\nFlatiron Health real-world evidence data was adjusted to make it more comparable to the CodeBreaK100 population, and that there was little\ndifference in the effective sample size compared with the MAIC. It also\nnoted that the PSWA was adjusted for 13 covariates including brain metastases. However, the ERG highlighted that there remains\nconsiderable uncertainty in this approach.",

Fusions of ALK and ROS 1 can be sought by first intention IHC or directly by RNA, if the delay of results does not allow. The fusion must be technically confirmed by a high-intensity marker of 1+, 2+, 3 or higher molecular intensity of the LHC; the fusion must be confirmed by either a RHC + 1 or a FISH + 2 (RHC + 3), or by another molecular marker of the same intensity. This may be done in one or two DNA and/ or RNA panels, and concomitantly or sequentially if the overall time to results is met (if the NGS analysis is performed on DNA and no additive abnormalities are found, the fusion search may be performed by NGS on RNA).

Numerous molecular alterations of NSCLC affecting tumour biology are now known, many of which are already an approved therapeutic target in clinical practice, including: KRAS gene mutations (20-30%), EGFR (10-15% of Caucasian patients and up to 40% of Asian patients), BRAF (2-4%), ALK rearrangements (3-7%), ROS1 (1-2%), RET (1-2%) NTRK (0.5-1%) and skipping of MET gene 14 (2%).",

These include RET, MET, HER2, KRAS and NTRK. RET fusions are seen in 12% of patients with N SCLC. The activity of multikinase inhibitors, such as kabozantinib, vandetanib, sunitinib, sorafenib and alektinib, has varied in early studies with response rates ranging from 16 to 47%. Pralsetinib is a more specific RET inhibitor that was recently approved for treatment in patients with RET-fusion-positive advanced NSCSCLC who have not previously been treated with an RET blocker. Intracranial response was seen in 5/9 patients with CNS metastases. Pralsetinib is available for subsidised prescription but is likely to be deregistered for use in Europe in the autumn of 2024. This is not based on lack of efficacy but on the transfer of the marketing authorisation to other pharmaceutical companies that do not intend to continue marketing the preparation in Europe. Selperkatinib is another novel RET inhibitor which in Phase I/II studies (LIBRETTO-001) resulted in a response rate of 64% in patients with RET infusion-positive advanced NSCLC and previous cytostatic therapy, and 85% in previously untreated patients [250]. Based on the above, treatment with pralsetinib or selperkatinib is recommended in RET-fusion-positive advanced NSCLC in patients who have not previously received a RET inhibitor.",

The importance of postoperative treatment in patients who have already received preoperative chemo-immunotherapy has also not been highlighted. There are also no comparative studies between surgery and radiotherapy in combination with chemo immunotherapy at stage III, where resectability may be difficult to assess preoperatively (especially for stage IIIB), and where the standard of care in Sweden in most regions has been chemoradiotherapy. Chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced NSCLC is discussed in the section on radiotherapy; the main conclusions and recommendations are as follows: • Curative Stage III radiation therapy should be combined with chemotherapy. • Concomitant treatment is more effective than sequential chemorediotherapy within recommended radiation dose ranges. • Platinum-based chemotherapies are best documented. In the primary investigation of patients with NSCLC, molecular pathology analysis of EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, KRAS, MET, RET-ERBB2 and NTRK status is recommended, as well as immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 expression in the tumour.",
