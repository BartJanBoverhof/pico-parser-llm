These additional studies highlight the importance of the FGFR2 signalling pathway for a subset of cholangiocarcinomas with FGfr2 fusion or rearrangement (see also background to Recommendation 4.46). Due to the good response rates, a strong recommendation was made here at a Level of Evidence 3. In addition to the abovementioned studies, numerous other clinical data from the first group of substances have been obtained for futibatinib. In addition to fusion genes, activating mutations or inframe deletions have also been described as relevant for therapeutic approaches [768], [769].

Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer worldwide. According to current GLOBOCAN data, more than 905 000 people worldwide fell ill with a primary liver tumor (HCK and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) in 2020 and more than 830 000 died from it [http:\\\\gco.iarc.fr]. The most common risk factors for HCC in Germany are currently chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and alcohol consumption. The incidence of HCC has increased significantly in the Western world due to chronic HCV infection-related cirrhosis of the liver as well as the significant increase in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Hepatitis (NASH) with advanced fibrosis or cirrosis. Cohort studies have shown that approximately 1-8% of all patients with cirrhosis develop HCC (2% for HBV, 3-8% for HCV) [3], [4], [5] whereas in NAFLD or NASH the incidence of HCC varies greatly (0.004 - 7.6%) [6]. In NAFLD or NASH, on the other hand, the incidence of HCC varies greatly (0.004 - 7.6%) [6],[7].",

Retrospective analyses have shown that TACE outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival can be improved by further differentiating the indication within the criteria of BC BLC stage. In particular, the size and number of tumour cores and the severity of the dysfunction are of minor importance. The vascularisation of the tumour core plays an important role in the outcome of TACE. Pseudoencapsulation suggests better outcomes than in poorly vascularized and diffuse arterially supplied tumours. Tumor sites at the 'water gap' between arterial supply territories also present increased demands on the interventional treatment technique. This involves high quality intraprocedural imaging, possibly including cone beam CT under arterial perfusion to clarify selective vascularisation. The greater the selectivity of transarterial therapy and the more pronounced and comprehensive the devascularizing effect of the embolization measures, the better the efficacy of TACE and the lesser the side-effect.",

On the basis of this systematic research, no recommendation could be made due to the lack of available studies. o The recommendation for first-line therapy of gemcitabine/ cisplatin has been extended to include the combination with durvalumab. o Progress under first line therapy is recommended by presentation in the Molecular Tumor Board. o In second lines, more treatment options based on molecular changes are available: no oncology programme. o Hepatocellular carcinoma and biliary carcinomas. o Long-term survival. o August 4.0 ▪ Patients with microsatellite instability or mitochondrial repair insufficiency with progestogen inhibitor have been recommended as preclinical therapy in the preparation of immunotherapy (progress) with pemibrolizumab in patients with progressive renal failure.

Of course, the limited availability of donor organs also plays an important role. The available analyses are mainly based on morphometric criteria, i.e. the number and size of tumour nodes. In the case of purely hepatic infection, the risk of recurrence after liver transplantation is correlated with the number (maximum or cumulative) size of existing tumours [151]. The so-called Milan criteria are used as the standard established criterion for the indication for liver transplant in most countries, as well as in Germany [152]. Patients with an unstable HCC within the Milan criteria have a 5-year survival rate of 65 - 80% and an HCCR rate of approximately 10-12% after liver transplants, [153] Therefore, the Milan criterion accepted in Germany also represents a high priority for planning liver transplantations every 3 months. If these criteria continue to be met, the corresponding matchMELD will be upgraded every 3 months.",

However, their inclusion in clinical trials is either the subject of ongoing studies or corresponding studies have not resulted in corresponding therapeutic approvals in Europe/Germany. Regarding the currently existing entity-wide approval test for NTRK inhibitors in Germany, it is noted that so far no definitive test has been able to be carried out for the occurrence of the required NRTK translocation therapies for HCC in the context of regular tumour induction therapy other than HCC, so that there is currently no definite therapeotic indication other than the existence of a molecular diagnostic test for cervical cancer.

A larger trial comparing arterial chemoembolization and radioactive Iodine 131 treat- ment did not show any difference in survival between the two groups. However,side effects were significantly lower in the group receiving radioactive Iodine 131treatment. Radioactive Iodine 131 treatment was also used in a adjuvant setting in patients resected for HCC without detectable residual disease. A longer delay of recurrence was observed in the treated group (70). Recommendations The use of radioactive Iodine 131 treatment can be used as an alternative for chemoembolization. 12. Treatment of early hepatocellular carcino- ma in patients on the waiting list for liver trans- plantation Liver transplantation is the therapy of choice for cir- rhotic patients with early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The optimal candidates for liver transplantation (single nodule < 5 cm or up to 3 nodules < 3 cm) achieve a 70% 5-year survival rate, with recurrence rate below 15% (59). The prognosis after transplantation is there- fore the same as for a similar underlying disease without HCC. However,these excellent results were obtained at a time when the average waiting time for liver trans- plantation was less than 6 months. But the tumour dou- bling time in asymptomatic HCC less than 5 cm was estimated to be around 4 months (71). Therefore, the delay between diagnosis and transplantation can allow the tumour to grow to stages that contraindicate trans- plantation.",

Chemoembolization is a common adjuvant treatment for patients on the waiting list. This option contributes to accurate staging of the intrahepatic disease and may achieve extensive tumor necrosis (76-80). The procedure is well tolerated in the majority of this subset of patients waiting for transplantation. Furthermore, it has been shown that the prevalence of hepatic arterial thrombosis, a graft-threatening complication of transplantation, was not increased in patients who underwent hepatic arterial chemoembolization before transplantation (76). It is probably the treatment of choice during the waiting list for patient with Child A cirrhosis when percutaneous injection is not feasible. If the waiting time before transplantation is expected to be shorter than 3 months,the interest of adjuvant ther- apies is probably clinically less relevant. If the waiting list exceeds seven months, a decision analysis has shown that living donor liver transplanta- tion is cost effective compared with cadaveric transplan- tation (66). Decision analysis has also shown that surgical resec- tion while waiting for transplantation for patients with single HCC and well preserved hepatic function pro- vides moderate gains in life expectancy and is cost effec- tive only if the waiting list exceeds one year (72). According to the available data, the following deci- sion tree could be proposed for cirrhotic patients with early HCC.",

Four European studies failed to document a sig- s nificant reduction in risk of developing HCC. There are various explanations for the differences in the result of these studies. First, in Japan, the sustained virological response rate (SVR) to interferon monotherapy is higher than observed in Europe or the US. Second,the incidence of HCC is much higher in Japan. Both factors make it easier to show a preventive effect of e therapy. Furthermore, there are important methodologi- cal questions. The majority of the studies are retrospecl tive and nonrandomised,introducing a bias in the selec. tion of patients for therapy. Also,different definitions of a response (biochemical, virological) are used. The still e unanswered question is whether interferon therapy can be beneficial in biochemical responders but virological C non responders. Because of potential biases in the published trials, it is premature to advocate the use of interferon as established therapy in HCV infected patients to prevent HCC. Prospective randomised controlled trials should repro- duce the findings in large numbers of patients before a h definitive conclusion on the long-term effects of inter- feron in HCV cirrhosis can be established. It should also y be investigated in prospective trials if more performant t treatment regimens with peginterferons and combination e of (peg)interferon and ribavirin will also favourably n influence the incidence of HCC. s c C • The most effective tool to prevent",

Screening and surveillance **Source Type:** clinical_guideline\n\nTrends in HCC survival in Europe (41) and in US (42) have shown a small improvement comparing the late seventies and early nineties with a 1-year survival improving from 8% to 18% (41) and 14 to 23% (42) respectively, but this could be attributed to the “lead-time bias” i.e. an artificial survival period corresponding to the interval from the point of detection by screening to the usual point of detection in the absence of screening (106). Nevertheless, a growing body of evidences strongly suggests that surveillance of patients with cirrhosis for the early detection of HCC could be effective in terms of survival prolongation at least in well selected cases. Moreover it seems unlikely that new randomised controlled trials will be put up to solve this issue. In Belgium, surveillance for HCC addresses almost exclusively patients with cirrhosis regardless of the aetiology, patients with chronic hepatitis C with extensive fibrosis of F3 stage in the METAVIR classification and HbsAg carriers. In these at-risk patients, surveillance should be reserved to those manifesting their willingness to attend the surveillance program and exhibiting a life expectancy of at least 5 years.

These additional studies highlight the importance of the FGFR2 signalling pathway for a subset of cholangiocarcinomas with FGfr2 fusion or rearrangement (see also background to Recommendation 4.46). Due to the good response rates, a strong recommendation was made here at a Level of Evidence 3. In addition to the abovementioned studies, numerous other clinical data from the first group of substances have been obtained for futibatinib. In addition to fusion genes, activating mutations or inframe deletions have also been described as relevant for therapeutic approaches [768], [769].

Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer worldwide. According to current GLOBOCAN data, more than 905 000 people worldwide fell ill with a primary liver tumor (HCK and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) in 2020 and more than 830 000 died from it [http:\\\\gco.iarc.fr]. The most common risk factors for HCC in Germany are currently chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and alcohol consumption. The incidence of HCC has increased significantly in the Western world due to chronic HCV infection-related cirrhosis of the liver as well as the significant increase in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Hepatitis (NASH) with advanced fibrosis or cirrosis. Cohort studies have shown that approximately 1-8% of all patients with cirrhosis develop HCC (2% for HBV, 3-8% for HCV) [3], [4], [5] whereas in NAFLD or NASH the incidence of HCC varies greatly (0.004 - 7.6%) [6]. In NAFLD or NASH, on the other hand, the incidence of HCC varies greatly (0.004 - 7.6%) [6],[7].",

Retrospective analyses have shown that TACE outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival can be improved by further differentiating the indication within the criteria of BC BLC stage. In particular, the size and number of tumour cores and the severity of the dysfunction are of minor importance. The vascularisation of the tumour core plays an important role in the outcome of TACE. Pseudoencapsulation suggests better outcomes than in poorly vascularized and diffuse arterially supplied tumours. Tumor sites at the 'water gap' between arterial supply territories also present increased demands on the interventional treatment technique. This involves high quality intraprocedural imaging, possibly including cone beam CT under arterial perfusion to clarify selective vascularisation. The greater the selectivity of transarterial therapy and the more pronounced and comprehensive the devascularizing effect of the embolization measures, the better the efficacy of TACE and the lesser the side-effect.",

Accordingly, neither AASLD nor EASL recommend a relatively low early detection rate for this population [2], [17]. Patients with chronic hepatic HCV disease with a high annual risk of HCC are at 3-8% risk of specific HCC [27], with no increased risk of occurrence [28]. In the absence of advanced liver fibrosis, the risk is low [28]. The risk of HCC decreases significantly in patients with chronic HCV after successful viral radicalization (SVR, sustained virological response) to 0.33% to 0.9% per year [27], [29].

Of course, the limited availability of donor organs also plays an important role. The available analyses are mainly based on morphometric criteria, i.e. the number and size of tumour nodes. In the case of purely hepatic infection, the risk of recurrence after liver transplantation is correlated with the number (maximum or cumulative) size of existing tumours [151]. The so-called Milan criteria are used as the standard established criterion for the indication for liver transplant in most countries, as well as in Germany [152]. Patients with an unstable HCC within the Milan criteria have a 5-year survival rate of 65 - 80% and an HCCR rate of approximately 10-12% after liver transplants, [153] Therefore, the Milan criterion accepted in Germany also represents a high priority for planning liver transplantations every 3 months. If these criteria continue to be met, the corresponding matchMELD will be upgraded every 3 months.",

Predictive molecular analyses are not yet required in regular diagnostics, but may be employed for advanced therapy planning. The molecular changes associated with HCC development have been characterized in multiple studies. These include genetic, epigenetic, and also transcriptional and posttranslational changes. Evidence for a significant involvement of germline mutations in HCC-associated tumors or a lack of substantial involvement in the HCC tumors is available in the main therapeutic protocols. However, their inclusion in clinical trials is either the subject of ongoing studies or corresponding studies have not resulted in corresponding therapeutic approvals in Europe/Germany. Regarding the currently existing entity-wide approval test for NTRK inhibitors in Germany, it is noted that so far no definitive test has been able to be carried out for the occurrence of the required NRTK translocation therapies for HCC in the context of regular tumour induction therapy other than HCC, so that there is currently no definite therapeotic indication other than the existence of a molecular diagnostic test for cervical cancer.

Radioembolization (selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT)) may be envisaged as downstaging to achieve resectability or Milan criteria for transplantation. Stereotactic radiation therapy (SBRT) provides precise radiation to a well-defined target volume, usually with few fractions and a high dose per fraction. Phase I and Phase II studies of SBRT of HCC show that radiation treatment can be administered with low risk and limited side effects to patients with Child Pugh A, maximum tumour diameter of 5 cm and adequate liver volume (83). Several publications show that children with Child-Pugh B and C developed irreversible liver failure, which is why those with child Pugh scores > 7 are not recommended for stereotactic irradiation (84, 85).

Bilobary HCC can also be treated with resection, possibly in combination with RFA (64). The existence of distant metastases, thrombosis of the venae portae or vena cavae main stem are absolute contraindications to resection or other topical treatment. Liver resection for HCC is accompanied by a perioperative mortality of less than 5% and a morbidity of 30-40%, depending on the patient's liver function. Serious complications such as leukaemia, postoperative softening and gallbladder abscess constitute less than 5%. Note, however, that the incidence of complications and mortality is many times lower at the peripheral end of the tumour than during laparoscopy and should be taken into account, especially in patients who have undergone hepatic ablation in recent years. The 5-year survival after resection for HCC is 35-50% in newer large cohorts (66). The long-term survival for small solitary HCC < 5 cm in diameter is close to 70% (67, 68). The risk of recurrence during the first 5 years after radical resection of HCC, for example, is in the order of 50-80% (69). There is no evidence for adjuvant chemotherapy after liver resection (70). The most effective way of prolonging the survival of patients with re-resection, ablation and/ or transarteriolymbolisation (TACE) is shown to be regressive treatment with regressive re-section and ablation.",

HCC occurs in 70-80% of cases in a cirrhotic liver. Objectives The overall aim of the guideline is to support an evidence-based cancer intervention of high and uniform quality across Denmark. Patient group The most common cause of cirrhosis (about 65%) in Denmark is alcohol consumption (2). The incidence and prevalence of cirrosis is relatively stable, but the underlying causes are changing in these years as alcohol-related cirrhomosis and Hep B+C decline, while fat-related Cirrhomoses have an increasing trend. Diagnosis and treatment of HCC involve physicians from different specialties, including medics with internal hepatological expertise (hereinafter referred to as hepato-implantation surgeons), HP/transplantation surgists, oncologists, radiologists, and interventional pathologists. The hepatologist is therefore the central figure in the management of these patients. At any time, the hepatologist must be able to assess liver function and, on this basis, assess which treatment measures the patient will be able best to tolerate. The hepatologists must be responsible for the treatment of liver disease both before and after cancer therapy. Target group for the use of this guideline This guidelines aims primarily at supporting clinical work and the development of clinical quality, which is why it is the primary target group for clinical health professionals working in the Danish healthcare system. Screening for HCC is recommended in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C and demonstrated cirrhosis, as well as in those with cirrhotic hepatitis C eradicated.",

The Milan criteria or AFP criteria are not used in non-cirrhotic patients with HCC. If the tumours are not resectable and the patient does not exhibit extrahepatic metastasis, the patient should be assessed for hepato-transplantation (C) 15. The following is a summary of Recommendations for liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma: an international consensus conference report (71). Other recent key references (72, 73). Liver transplantation should be reserved for patients with 5-year survival comparable to that of non-HCC patients, i.e. approximately 70%. Prognosis is assessed primarily on the basis of the diameter of the largest tumour and the number of tumours in the liver. There must be no extrahepatic tumour. Microinvasion is a very poor prognostic sign and there is some correlation to tumour size and number as well as certain biomarkers; however, there are no reliable, either radiological or biomarker methods to detect microinvision, which is why microbial invasion is not yet included in the selection of liver transplants. However, if one could use multiple criteria to validate the prognosis of patients with micro-transplantation, we will be able to use a better prognosis for those patients with non-AFPs (see below). In non-cirrhotic patients, liver transplantation should be considered on a case-by-case basis as an alternative to resection if the tumour is confined to the liver, irrespective of its size and number.",

This is a fine distinction that is not always possible to make. An additional concern about fine needle biopsy is the risk of bleeding and seeding. Most studies that demonstrate seeding after needle biopsy do not specify the size of the lesion that was biopsied (42, 43). Morphological characteristics can help in the separation of HGDN from HCC, but the addition of special dyes and immunohistochemical dyes is advised. Special staining for reticulin, whereby loss or alteration of reticulation is seen in HCC markers (44) is known. Additionally, by applying a panel of immune histological markers of Glycoprotein 703, Glutamicin 703, and Vitamins 70 can assist in the differentiation of tumors (such as heat shock) from the tumor (diffusion). All 3 negatives can be seen in 100% of low grade dysplastic nodules (LGDN), 73% of high grade dysoplastic nudules (HGdN) and 3% of early HCC. All 3 positives are seen in less than half of early hCC, but no LGDN/HG DN. At 2 positive markers, regardless of which, using this 3-marker panel, the sensitivity and specificity for detection of Early HCC is seen at 72% and 100% respectively in resectates.

The screening involves deciding at what level the risk of HCC should be high enough to trigger screening, what screening test to carry out and how often it should be carried out. Finally, deciding what action an abnormal screen test should trigger. The risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis over a period of 5 years is about 7%. Since some groups of patients with Chronic Hepatitis B have an increased incidence of hepatocell carcinomas (hCC) even without having developed cirrhotic disease, screening for HCC should be performed in patients who have a family history of HCC, Asian patients over 40-50 years of age, and African patients over the age of 25 years. Of the available studies used to screen for HCC, measurement of the tumor marker Alphafetoprotein (AFP) has been shown to be inadequate as a screening method. Most studies have used 6-month intervals between controls, there are no randomised trials that have established the optimal screening interval. Nodules larger than 1 cm found by imaging of a cirrhotic liver should be examined with either a 3-phase CT scan or a dynamic contrast-enhanced one. If the appearance of the lesions is typical for HCC, the diagnosis of HCC may be made. If diagnostic imaging findings are not characteristic, a second contrast enhanced examination should be performed with another imaging diagnostic modality (MR/CT or contrast enhancement in expert centers) or an ultrasound measurement should be made from a coarse biopsy reading algorithm (see above).

For lesions > 1 cm in diameter, multi-detector CT scan or dynamic MRI should be performed. Figure 1. Algorithms for the examination of small nodes found by screening or other imaging in patients at risk of HCC in cirrhotic liver (MDCT = Multi-Detector CAT scan). Diagnosis of HCD in patients without liver cirrhosis In a normal liver without cirrosis, the likelihood of developing HCC is much lower and the guidelines given cannot be used in these cases. In the normal liver, hypervascular processes with venous hout wasta represent metastases from primarily vascularized mammary tumors, such as carcinomas, renal cell carcinoma or neuroocrine tumors. If a primary tumor with the same vascular profile is not known, a biopsy is necessary to make a histological diagnosis. 18F-FDG, the most widely used PET tracer in oncology, has a sensitivity of approximately 50-65% for intrahepatic HCC, whereas some studies find a slightly higher sensitiveness for extrahepaticHCC. A number of other PET tracers, including 68Ga-PSMA, 11C/18F-choline and 11C-Acetate, have been shown in smaller studies to have a higher sensitisation for HCC than 18Ga-FG, especially in tumors with FDG uptake.

At the same time, the presence of small foci of HCC in these resects typically suggests that these lesions are pre-stages to typical HCC (37, 38, 40). The frequency with which such lesions develop into HCC is typically unknown; in contrast, HCC has well-defined stages and exhibits a distinct histological continuum between the ultradiagnostic and typical margins (24, 40). There is likely to be a continuum between HGDN and HCC rather than two distinct stages. Patients with hepatic nodules who have a non-specific vascular profile and a negative biopsy should continue with close follow-up. There are no data indicating the optimal follow up tactic at this point, but repeat biopsy or follow-ups CT/MR to detect further growth should be considered. There is data indicates that the smaller the lesion, the less likely there is to be microscopic vascular invasion (39).",

Recommendations are graded in 3 categories according to the level of evidence of data found in the literature.Results: The diagnosis and staging of HCC is essentially based on clinical, biological and imaging features. A pathological analysis obtained by a biopsy of tumoral and non-tumoral liver is rec- ommended. HCCs can be divided into 2 groups, taking into account not only the tumor stage, but also liver function. HCCs accessible to curative treatments are tumors that are in Milan criteria or with an AFP score ≤ 2, mainly treated by surgical resection, local ablation or liver transplantation. Intermediate and advanced HCCs with no liver insufﬁciency, accessible only to palliative treatments, beneﬁt from TACE, SIRT or systemic therapy according to the presence or absence of macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. Conclusion: Such recommendations are in permanent optimization and each individual case must be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert board.",

There is there- fore no evidence of the beneﬁt of adjuvant therapy after a curative treatment of HCC.However , the management of chronic liver disease improves prognosis and may reduce the risk of recurrence. This concerns the treatment of the underlying liver dis- ease (including HCV), management of comorbidities and prevention of complications related to portal hyperten- sion in case of cirrhosis. In 2016, a retrospective cohort study lead to controversy by suggesting an increased risk of HCC recurrence in patients treated with direct act- ing antivirals (DAAs) [54]. In a cohort of 58 patients with a median follow-up of 5.7 months, 16 patients (27.6%) developed a recurrence. Following this publication, many teams reported their experience showing discordant results with methodological limitations. However , the analysis of 3 French cohorts including more than 6000 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis, did not ﬁnd an increased risk of HCC recurrence after DAA treatment [55]. These reassuring results have been conﬁrmed by several other large cohorts and meta-analyses [56,57] . In these patients it is therefore recommended to perform a cross-sectional imaging before DAA treatment, since there is currently no robust enough data to determine the role of DAAs on the evolution of HCC.External radiotherapyStereotactic radiotherapy (6 to 20 Gy/session) has been studied in phase I and II studies with good local control rates at 1 and 2 years (between 90 and 100%), high survival rates (80-90% and 70% at 1 and 2 years respectively) and low complication rates [58—60] .

In cirrhotic patients with HCC limited to the liver and with good residual liver function, treatment should aim, where possible, at the eradication of the neoplasm. A first consideration should be whether the patient is eligible for a liver transplant as this procedure represents a cure for both HCC and the underlying cirrhosis. However, in practice, liver transplantation is applicable to a very small fraction of cirrotic HCC patients due to clinical and oncological limitations associated with organisational and social considerations. Therefore, given the limited availability of organs, the use of transplantation must be based on the concept of equity between the different categories of patients and cannot disregard the calculation of the benefit of survival provided to the individual patient with transplantation compared to the expected results with other possible anticancer treatments The best survival results (75-80% at 5 years) after liver transplantation for HCC on hepatic cirrhosis are in patients who meet the Milan criteria, i.e. a single neoplasm ≤ 5 cm or multiples of no more than 3 nodes and diameter ≤ 326 cm (Level 2++).",

This negative result was then confirmed by another French randomised study69 (EVIDENCE Level 1) and by the meta-analyses based on the systematic review of all studies conducted (EVEL 1+4). (Level of evidence 1+), and from the meta-analyses based on the systematic review of all studies conducted47 (Evidence Level 1++). Similarly, in an EORTC study, randomised, with factor design, involving 244 patients, no effect on survival was identified following treatment with antiandrogens (nilutamide) or analogues of LHRH (goserelin) or both70 (EVIDENCE Level 1+). Recommendation Strength Clinical recommendation SIGN clinical recommendations In patients with HCC, treatment with tamoxifen or strong androgenic anti-A negatives should not be undertaken. The use of chemotherapeutic agents in HCC patients, characterised by a high rate of marked impairment of more or less potent hepatic function, results in increased carcinogenicity associated with elevated risk of cancer, in addition to the intrinsically low toxicity of HCC-related carcinogens. In addition, HCC can be listed among cancers intrinsically characterized by less chemo-sensitivity. Numerous chemotherapeutic drugs, as single agents or in combination, have been experimented over the past decades in patients with HCC, producing more or less disappointing percentages of objective responses, without ever producing a solid demonstration of efficacy. Among the various cytotoxic drugs experimented and variously used in clinical practice, doxorubicin, used as a single agent, is reported.",

Class B defines an intermediate condition and is particularly heterogeneous. It can therefore already include severely impaired patients with significant hepatic ascites or patients with still discreetly preserved liver function, and should still be considered hypotensive among these patients anyway. For these patients, liver transplantation should also be considered immediately. If they are not transplantable, they may be susceptible to other therapies, but the choice must be very careful, individualized and absolutely managed within a multidisciplinary team, because of the risk of precipitating irreversible liver failure. Since cancer treatments for HCC can cause changes, at least temporary, in portal pressure, every patient with HCC on cirrhosis should undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) for signs of portal hypertension and for the gradation of bleeding risk from varicose veins, before the start of oncological therapy. In the management of the treatment of a patient with HCC, consideration should be given not only to the level of liver function but also to the possible treatment of the cause of the HCC. There are currently a number of medicines available for treatment of cirrhotic stage HBV infection, in the category of nucleotide analogues. A patient with replicating HBV virus cirrhosis complicated by HCC should be treated immediately with antiviral therapy for HBV, especially in anticipation of oncological treatments21.

Overall survival (6.40 vs 4.97 months, HR = 0.80, p = 0.07), for the FOLFOX4 regimen compared to doxorubicin71. In detail, the study provided for the randomization of patients with advanced and/ or unresectable HCC, assigning 184 patients to receive FOLVOX4, in the classical schedule every 2 weeks, and 187 patients receiving doxorubicine, at a dose of 50 mg/ m2 every 3 weeks. It should be noted that the study population has different characteristics from Western patients with HCC: over 90% of the randomized patients had HCC related to hepatitis B virus infection while just over half of the patients were cirrhotic and of the latter 89% had good liver function (Child-Pugh). These results cannot be extrapolated to Western patients who are largely affected by hepatic cirrhosis and generally have worse liver function than the patients in the study. In addition to highlighting the diversity - in terms of disease characteristics and prognosis - of Asian patients compared to Western patients, it should be recalled above all that the study in question adopted a control arm (doxorubicin) which, at present, is not the standard and cannot be considered an adequate control for these patients.",

Prior to the recent randomised trials of sorafenib, no medication had been shown to be effective in these patients, for whom the best supportive therapy remained the only valid therapeutic option. The efficacy of the multi-targeted small molecule kinase inhibitor soraphenib in the treatment of advanced stage HCC has been demonstrated in 2 randomised Phase III trials: SHARP52 and the Asia-Pacific study64. Both studies enrolled patients who were not eligible for any loco-regional treatment (either at diagnosis or after failure of any previous treatments), with good liver function (Child-Pugh). The two studies are significantly different in terms of patient characteristics, as the SHArP study was conducted in Israel (Western Europe), Australia (North America), and Korea (Eastern Asia), while the Taiwan (China). In both randomised trials, treatment with sorafenib (administered at a dose of 400 mg twice daily until instrumental and clinical progression or until onset of unacceptable toxicity) resulted in a significant prolongation of overall survival, and a significant lengthening of the time to disease progression (Evidence Level 1).",

This Directive focuses on what is the best care for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to current standards. It covers the following topics: Surveillance, diagnosis, stereotactic radiotherapy, palliative system therapy, radiation embolization, surgery, follow-up and aftercare. Who is this directive aimed at? The Directive applies to all adult patients with HCC and to adult patients at increased risk of HCC who need to be included in a surveillance programme. The Directive is limited to patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis where this is indicated. Scope The Directive addresses all professionals involved in second or third line surveillance, diagnosis and treatment and counselling of patients with Hepatocellulare carcinomas. For hepatocell carcinom patients, this Directive is a care system in the form of surgical diagnosis, treatment and how to deal with liver cancer. How did the directive come about? The initiative for the directive came from the Dutch Association of Gastrointestinal and Liver Doctors (NVMDL). The directive was drafted by a multidisciplinary committee with representatives from the Netherlands Internists Association, Dutch Association for Healology, Netherlands Association for Nuclear Medicine, Dutch Society for Pathology, Dutch Radiology Association, Netherlands Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology, The Netherlands Association of Liver Patients and Nurses & Caregivers Netherlands.

This is related to the inaccuracy of the findings (small number of studies) and limitations in study design (risk or bias). Row 2:\nHepato cellular cancer: For the second-line treatment, one RCT was found, comparing regorafenib with placebo (Bruix, 2017). The systematic literature analysis shows that treatment with regoraffenib could have positive effects on risk and overall survival. Due to the outcome of tumour responses, complications, and lack of evidence based on clinical findings, the overall literature findings were considered to be inaccurate due to the low quality of life.

Recommendation Use for patients after treatment for HCC the following follow-up schedule: Months Serum AFp determination Perform CT/ MRI liver 6 X X including thorax 12 X X Including thurax 18 X X 24 X X including tharax Year 2-5 á 6 months X Xincluding thrax Consider in post-treatment follow up of HCC imaging of the liver alternately to be combined with a CT Thorax. 68 patients (45%) developed metastases at presentation at the time of HCC and 83 patients (55%) metastasized during follow-up with the largest proportion involving lung metastasis (47%) (Uka, 2007). Detection only for better survival The Health Council states in its report that early detection of new manifestations of cancer should be found only for gains in duration or quality of life (Health Council, 2007) Earlier detection is effective at an early stage rather than at a later stage if symptoms have arisen. Early detection should only be carried out in a programmatic approach. Depending on the literature of the HCC, and whether a small tumour needs to be treated locally or undergo a local reassessment, early treatment for HCC patients requires a translation to a local review. If primary HCC was accompanied by elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), AFP may be used in follow-up for hepatocellular carcinoma detection of recurrent disease. An example of a pre-follow-up is shown in Table 1.",

Recommendation Inform patients and family/neighbours about the possible emergence of complaints after treatment of HCC. Report these early consequences of cancer using a (validated) screening tool. This screening should be used from diagnosis to treatment and follow-up. Considerations Disease and treatment have major consequences The Health Council concludes that many patients, after intentional curative treatment for cancer, suffer from complaints (Health Council, 2007). These complaints may be limited or extensive, both physical and psychological in nature, and may occur early or later. This is called distress. By distress is meant: an unpleasant emotional experience of a psychological (cognitive, behavioural, emotional), social and/or spiritual nature that may interfere with the ability to effectively cope with cancer, the accompanying physical symptoms and treatment (Guideline on detecting the need for psychosocial care, 2017). These are mostly physical consequences that are clearly linked to the specific nature of the cancer, consequences of the treatment, psychsocial problems and general complaints.

In a study from the United States in >5000 HCC patients from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) United Nations Organisation for Standardized Testing and Evaluation of Carcinoma (HECTS), TACE had the best therapeutic efficacy by bridging costs and transplantation to TARE. Row 8: Hepatocellular carcinoma: The better cost-effectiveness of TARE is mainly explained by the fact that TACE consists of multiple treatments. This was confirmed in a study where this was the only variable that caused the optimal strategy to change from TACE to TARE (Ray, 2012). Row 9: Hepatocell carcinom: TARE's better cost effectiveness was also confirmed in patients with more extensive disease, larger tumors, and more tumors.

Examples of questionnaires are the EORTC QLQ-30 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire) and the FACT-G (Functional Assessment of cancer Therapy-General), both of which have disease-specific modules for HCC to assess specific symptoms. The disease-Specific Modules of HCC are EorTC QlQ-HCC18 and FACt-Hep [427-429]. Regular measurements can be very helpful in guiding healthcare staff to evaluate treatments, to individualize care and to enable the measurement and management of symptoms. Results from the measures can help healthcare personnel to get a picture of which symptoms are affecting the patient and can provide a more effective measure of the degree of persistence of symptoms based on the use of the NRS Symptomatic Rating Scale (Symptomatic Validation Instrument) [430]. The majority of symptoms can be graded on the NRS (Numeric Rating Scale) 010. Cancer-related fatigue is defined as an abnormal fatigue a stressful, persistent, subjective feeling of physical, mental, emotional, and cognitive fatigue or exhaustion. Many patients describe this fatigue as a total lack of energy that makes itself felt even without exertion. Fatigue is unrelated to activities performed and affects daily life [432, 433].

Due to positive results from studies with immunotherapy combination in palliative HCC, the possibility of pre-operative systemic therapy is also being studied. Evidence is currently limited to minor and II studies with few patients included and therefore not recommended in routine care [354, 355]. Treatment with neoadjuvant systemic oncology therapy is not recommended within the framework of clinical trials. The risk of recurrence following curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively high, with approximately 70% of recurrences occurring within 5 years of surgery [77]. The risk factors for recurrence are tumour size > 5cm, multiple tumours in the liver, vascular invasion and low differentiation [356]. A number of essential venous diseases have been studied, but no studies exist at present to support a therapeutic indication. Systemic therapy should be offered to patients with good functional status (WHO PS 0-1) with good hepatic function (Child Pugh A). For patients with more marginal liver function (child B7) there is no absolute limit, but individual assessment should be made. Clinical ascites or encephalopathy are contraindications, as well as elevated bilirubin above about 50, while albumin levels, which can be influenced by many factors, are of minor importance. Diagnosis of possible portal hypertension and especially treatment of varicose veins in the esophagus should precede the start of systemic therapy, see section 8.4.2 Liver function evaluation and 13.1 Cirrhosis complications.",

Diagnosis and treatment of portal hypertension and cirrhosis complications should be viewed and conducted in the perspective of the individual patient's entire disease. When diagnosed with HCC, 70 to 80% of patients have cirrhotic liver disease, which is not infrequently unknown and compensated, where HCC may be the first symptom of a previously unknown cirrosis. Patients should undergo standardised examination to clarify the genesis of liver disease. Some conditions are treatable and adequate management of these conditions may improve the prognosis of HCC. The diagnosis can be based on clinical evaluation, combined with radiography, biology, and endoscopic findings. It is important to realize that there are situations in which radiology cannot confirm or exclude the presence of liver cirrhosis! Compensated cirrho­sis has a relatively good prognosis, the 10-year survival rate is about 80%.",

According to data from SweLiv, > 2/3 of all patients diagnosed with HCC in Sweden between 2012 and 2022 had underlying liver disease. the actual rate of underlying liver cirrhosis among patients with HCC is thus higher than previously reported.[2] Similarly, MASLD is an increasing and often underestimated cause of HCC in Sweden [17]. Underlying MASLD should always be suspected in patients with hCC who do not have other known predisposing liver diseases, but who also have type 2 diabetes and/or obesity, especially in association with other metabolic co-morbidities such as hypertension, high blood lipids or coronary artery disease [7].",

Radiological methods are important for early documentation of objective signs of treatment response that correlate with survival. A disadvantage of the standard method RECIST in HCC is that there are effective treatments, such as some locoregional modalities and targeted drugs, that do not affect the size of tumors and where the clinical effect of treatment is therefore not captured [175]. The problem of the absence of tumor shrinkage was addressed with the introduction of the concept of viabletumor in the modified RECISTM criteria (mRECIST) [176]. Tumor viability is defined radiologically as the remaining contrast-suppressing area in the tumor I. Instead of measuring the maximum length of the tumor according to the MRCIST 1.1 method, the maximum diameter of the longest diametrical remaining area (MRCIST) or the maximum time remaining in the intermediate stage (TACRISTM) in the region after complete non-absorption or contraception of the HCC (T) is measured by TACRIST 1. However, several studies have shown that response (=ORR, overall response rate) after locoregional treatment as measured by mRECIST predicts survival (OS) [177]. The first control with DT or MRI is usually done after 1 3 months [178]. mRICIST is also used in studies of systemic treatment of HCC. However, at advanced HCC, international guidelines recommend both mRECTIST and conventional RECIST [179]. post-treatment response in LR-TR viable (definitely or probably viable), LR- TR equivocal (oclar viability) and LR-RT nonviable. LR-Tr viable is defined as nodular, expansive or thick, irregular tissue with any of: • arterial phase recharge • washout • contrast recharge similar to that before treatment. Expected patterns of contra-recharge after treatment, such as thin recharge in the periphery of the lesion after embolization, should be characterised as LR-T R non viable.",

Transarterial therapies (see section 11.5 Transartery Locoregional Therapy) presuppose, as do curative treatments, that the tumour burden is confined to the liver, but may be given in multifocal tumour disease. Transarteral treatments are not considered to be curative treatment alone, even if a complete response can be achieved. However, transartery therapy may also be used for the purpose of tumour suppression pending liver transplantation or first downging. Systemic oncological therapy (see Section 11.6 Systemic treatment) may be used in advanced HCC, such as metastasis or malignancy, taking into account overall cardiac function, liver disease and co-morbidity. In addition, there are some limitations with regard to portal thrombosis. Ablation is considered a potentially curative treatment and requires a smaller tumor, limited to the liver, adequate liver function, and technical conditions to perform the ablation without harming nearby structures. Ablation provides an equivalent survival rate and is associated with fewer complications, shorter care time, and less resource availability than resection [227-229]. Local treatment minimizes the volume of healthy liver that is removed. The disadvantages are that the risk of incomplete tumor destruction and local recurrence is higher than for central resection. There is a limitation in large tumors that can be treated with marginal water (3 cm is a common limit). Gallus gallus tumors may be treated adequately but with increased risk of recurrence.",

In the case of hepatic impairment or limited multifocal disease, liver transplantation is preferable, but requires limited comorbidity. In large singular tumor, liver resection is often possible, but presupposes good liver function. In established HCC less than 3 cm, ablation is the first choice, thanks to good tolerability and low complication rate, which can allow treatment even for fragile patients. In choosing between resection or ablation, several factors must be weighed in addition to size, such as localization, co- morbidity and hepatic function. Ablation with increased risk of local recurrence, but it should be weighted against the possibility of reintervention, lower morbidities and cost [227-229]. In the case of HCC in a non-cirrhotic liver, resection/ablation is a first-line option. The prerequisite for resection is that it can be performed radically (R0) without causing hepatic failure. Laparoscopic surgery has been shown to provide shorter treatment time with the same oncological outcome compared to open surgery in a randomised study in HCC < 5 cm. In small tumours, < 3 cm, ablation may be an appropriate option even in non-chirrhotical liver, but it requires that the diagnosis is established earlier or can be confirmed by biopsy in conjunction with the intervention (see section 8.2 Radiological diagnosis of hCC). However, transplantation may only be offered to patients with tumour burden within selection criteria (see section 11.4 Liver Transplantation (LTx) in HCC). Resection/ablation is usually the first choice in patients with cirrhosis and preserved liver function, Child-Pugh A, especially at Child- Pugh 5 and less tumour-burden, as the differences in 5-year survival compared to transplantation are limited [232-234]. assessments at a multidisciplinary conference.",

Target: one-year survival exceeding 50% after diagnosis for actively palliatively treated patients. Five-year post-diagnostic survival > 25% for the whole group of HCC, and > 40% for the total group treated with liver resections, ablations, and transplants. Mått: Andel av HCC- patienter som upptäckts vid HCC-övervakning, och som\ngenomgått behandling med resektion, ablation eller transplantation. Måltal: 70 % av HCC som upptäckts vid HCC-övervakning ska vara möjlig att\nplanera för kurativ syftande behandling. Kommentar: Syftet med övervakningen är att detektera tumör i ett tidigt skede,\noch därmed kunna erbjuda kurativt syftande behandling. En hög andel kurativt\nbehandlade tumörer, av de upptäckta vid HCC-övervakning, förutsätter hög kvalitet i organisationen som ansvarar för övervakningen.

TACE+ systemic therapy: Many studies on combination therapy with TACE and sorafenib have been conducted without demonstrating any clear therapeutic benefit. Since the introduction of newer and more alternative systemic treatments, some promising results have been described, but there is still insufficient evidence to generate recommendations regarding combination therapy of TACE with systemic treatment [348]. In isolated cases, successful downstaging may also lead to resection. Neoadjuvant TACE therapy before resection: Although a single study described benefits of neoadjuvent TACE before resections [349] there is no convincing evidence why this is not recommended for resectable pathology Adjuvant post-resection TACE treatment: There are several Asian/Chinese studies describing survival gains with adjuvant postoperative TACE after liver resection for HCC, especially in adverse factors such as microwave invasion or larger tumors [351-353]. However, this strategy has rarely been found in Western populations, and the evidence is lacking here.",

The assessment should clarify the following: • the objective of rehabilitation • the planned interventions and who is responsible for implementing them • the patient' s own responsibility for rehabilitation, including self-care advice • where the patient can turn for any questions or new needs • the cirrhosis follow-up group with the patient should be monitored in a unit with a medical hepatologist, while the responsibility for monitoring patients without cirrhotic disease is often shared with other units (section 17.6). If the patient has one or more unhealthy lifestyle habits, support should be offered according to local routines. The patient should be advised to pay attention to the following symptoms and to contact the contact nurse if they occur: • fatigue • weight loss, loss of appetite, nausea • fever without cause • jaundice and itching • ascites, bone oedema and gastrointestinal bleeding which are symptoms of liver failure Radiological follow-up is provided if functional status and underlying liver function provide scope for renewed antitumor therapy.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria of importance for patient selection in the clinic are that all included patients were in good functional status (WHO PS 0-1) and with good liver function (Child-Pugh score 5-6) as well as contraindications including previous organ transplantation, untreated portal hypertension or systemic hypertension. Results from the study were overall survival at 12 months was 67.2% (95% 61, 73-71) and 54, 66% (95% CI 45, 62-64) [9, 360-35] respectively. Tremelimumab in combination with durumab was studied in the HIMALAYA study in which 1171 patients were randomised to tremelemumab combined with duramavalub (STRIDE), durumavalub as single therapy (see below) or sorafenib 1:1:1. The HIMALAYA study above also studied single-regimen durvalumab on a par with sorafenib. The results show that dur valumab was non-inferior to sorafen, i.e. no significant difference in survival between the two single regimens [361]. In Checkmate 459, 743 patients with WHO PS 0-1 and Child Pugh A were randomised to treatment with either nivolum or sorapenib. No difference in overall survival could be demonstrated [363]. Thus, based on the current state of knowledge, it is difficult to see that immunity in the single regimen has a place in the treatment of HCC. In the SHARP study published in 2008, 602 patients with advanced HCC were randomised between the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib and placebo. Patients in the trials had liver function assessed as Child-Pugh A, but the NCCN guidelines state that patients with a child-pugh B score of up to 7 may be considered for sorafenib if the patient is otherwise considered suitable.",

This applies particularly in cirrhosis and in particular in Child-Pugh > 6 p. Time to tumour recurrence should be taken into account. Grades of evidence: (++). • Transplantation of HCC recurrence after resection and ablation is relevant at tumour onset within the Metrotomy C++ 2.0 range. • Patients with tumours above the Metrotec 2.0 range can be treated with other treatment modalities for tumour downregulation and to achieve the lowest level of tumour susceptibility to a Metrotome C++ 2.0, and then treatment may also be offered to patients with liver function if the tumour is acceptable and limited to the metrotec level of 2.0 or below. • In more extensive relapses of HCC following LTx where systemic therapy is indicated, tyrosine kinase inhibitors should be selected, as immunotherapy following the LTx carries a significant risk of rejection and graft loss. The prognosis for recurrence of HCC is strongly linked to the tumour burden and the treatment that can be offered, but also the initial tumor burden has some influence. This also applies to patients undergoing transplantation for HCC recurrence, where tumour recurrence within one year of resection is a strong risk factor for post-transplant recurrence.",

For this reason, attempts have been made to create scoring systems that estimate the risk of HCC, such as PAGE-B, CAGE-G, SAGE­B, etc., but they currently provide insufficient guidance for validation, as there are no Asian patients in the population without surveillance and some patients, for example, have a risk factor of over 40 years of age without HCC [113-118]. Factors that increase the risk of HCC in carriers of chronic hepatitis B: • East and Southeast Asian or African ancestry • male gender • increasing age • presence in a close relative • high levels of hepatitis B DNA (> 20,000 IU/ ml) • active inflammation with high ALT levels • advanced fibrosis (stage F3) [119, 120] • hepatitis B virus genotype C • long duration of infection • co-infection with hepatitis C or D • previous exposure to aflatoxin • diabetes mellitus. In chronic hepatitis C, 1520% are estimated to develop cirrhosis of the liver after 20 years. With persistent viremia, the incidence of HCC in Europe in hepatitis C-related cirrhotic disease is approximately 3% per year [110, 121, 122]. The risk of HCH is correlated to the degree of fibrosis as measured by elastography [123]. HCC monitoring is recommended for patients with hepatitis C-related cirrhosis with both active and extinct hepatitis C. The recommendation for extinguished hepatitis C applies to patients assessed prior to treatment as having cirrhotic liver disease (based on clinical findings, biochemistry and elastography, or liver biopsy), even in cases where the liver cell count decreases to < 12.5 kPa after successful treatment. There is no current knowledge on when and in which subgroups HCC surveillance may be discontinued as HCC can also occur in liver cells with normalized liver cell counts after excretion [126].",
