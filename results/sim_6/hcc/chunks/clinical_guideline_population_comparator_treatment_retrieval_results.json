Of course, the limited availability of donor organs also plays an important role. The available analyses are mainly based on morphometric criteria, i.e. the number and size of tumour nodes. In the case of purely hepatic infection, the risk of recurrence after liver transplantation is correlated with the number (maximum or cumulative) size of existing tumours [151]. The so-called Milan criteria are used as the standard established criterion for the indication for liver transplant in most countries, as well as in Germany [152]. Patients with an unstable HCC within the Milan criteria have a 5-year survival rate of 65 - 80% and an HCCR rate of approximately 10-12% after liver transplants, [153] Therefore, the Milan criterion accepted in Germany also represents a high priority for planning liver transplantations every 3 months.

Retrospective analyses have shown that TACE outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival can be improved by further differentiating the indication within the criteria of BC BLC stage. In particular, the size and number of tumour cores and the severity of the dysfunction are of minor importance. The vascularisation of the tumour core plays an important role in the outcome of TACE. Pseudoencapsulation suggests better outcomes than in poorly vascularized and diffuse arterially supplied tumours. Tumor sites at the 'water gap' between arterial supply territories also present increased demands on the interventional treatment technique. This involves high quality intraprocedural imaging, possibly including cone beam CT under arterial perfusion to clarify selective vascularisation. The greater the selectivity of transarterial therapy and the more pronounced and comprehensive the devascularizing effect of the embolization measures, the better the efficacy of TACE and the lesser the side-effect.",

For example, a monthly increase in AFP greater than 15 ng/ml has been shown to be an unfavorable prognostic parameter, as have AFP values greater than 500 ng/mL [172] and greater than 1000 ng/ mL [17] respectively. In a further analysis, an AFP value",

The liver necrosis may be followed by functional decompensation, but if only segmental portal tumor invasions are present and there are favourable conditions for selective arterial devascularization with segmental or subsegmental implementation of TACE, this can be done efficiently and with low side effects. Adapted supportive therapy should be performed before, during and after TACE. This requires adequate analgesia, anthemesis, hydration, antibiotics if necessary. Conventional Lipiodol-TACE and Drug-eluting Beadogen TACE can be used as approximately equivalent procedures depending on the individual risk profile and preferences of the treatment (see Appendix). Therefore, a preference for this treatment technique can be considered in patients who are at particular risk in this regard. To date, no evidence has been provided that drug-eluting bead TACE improves the survival prognosis of patients compared to conventional TACE. 3.4 Operative and interventional therapeutic procedures 84 For TACE, anthracyclines (doxorubicin, epirubicin) or platinum derivatives should be used [300].

Since TACE is normally indicated in patients with multiple and/ or large tumour centres in stage B BCLC, it may need to be repeated to achieve complete devascularisation of all tumour clusters. The aim is to achieve full devascularization of all tumor centres while largely preserving the non-affected hepatic parenchyma. This requires numerous selective and super-selective catheterizations using microcatheters and sometimes complex intra-procedural diagnostics. The amounts of emboli and cytostats applied in a therapy session are limited to avoid adverse reactions and limit complications. In particular, no more than 10 to 15 ml should be administered in a post-intervention course within 4 weeks of TACE administration. A post-interventional follow-up should be performed within 4-12 weeks after TACE, requiring adequate residual treatment with contrast-enhanced biphasic arterial and portal venous contrast CT or MRI followed by mRECIST-compliant assessment of remission. Therapeutic options should be re-evaluated in an interdisciplinary tumour conference in the following situations: • regularly after 2 TACE; • increasing obliteration of tumour-supplying arterial vessels, resulting in a lack of arterial access to the tumour; • reaching a cumulative dose of 450 mg/ m2 doxorubicin; • the occurrence of contraindications, such as significant deterioration of liver function, extrahepatic metastasis, tumour invasion of large portal or hepatic veins, worsening of the general condition of patients with tumour related symptoms (OG/ EC = 2).",

Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer worldwide. According to current GLOBOCAN data, more than 905 000 people worldwide fell ill with a primary liver tumor (HCK and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) in 2020 and more than 830 000 died from it [http:\\\\gco.iarc.fr]. The most common risk factors for HCC in Germany are currently chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and alcohol consumption. The incidence of HCC has increased significantly in the Western world due to chronic HCV infection-related cirrhosis of the liver as well as the significant increase in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Hepatitis (NASH) with advanced fibrosis or cirrosis. Cohort studies have shown that approximately 1-8% of all patients with cirrhosis develop HCC (2% for HBV, 3-8% for HCV) [3], [4], [5] whereas in NAFLD or NASH the incidence of HCC varies greatly (0.004 - 7.6%) [6]. In NAFLD or NASH, on the other hand, the incidence of HCC varies greatly (0.004 - 7.6%) [6],[7].",

These parameters must be captured by careful macroscopic and histological processing and represented in the finding. Findings from explanted livers must be able to derive the transplantation-relevant criteria, as they represent important information for the assessment of recurrence risk. Clinical staging systems, such as BCLC, CLIP or JIS, cannot be represented alone in the histological finding. For tumor grading, various international grading systems are used. the AFIP grading [110], while more recent proposals prefer a 3-stage grading [108]; there is no global consensus. Regardless of the grading system used, the grade has prognostic relevance after resection and transplantation. As a synthesis of the different grading systems and for unification, the new WHO classification proposes a new 3-member grading, the use of which is recommended [105].

A larger trial comparing arterial chemoembolization and radioactive Iodine 131 treat- ment did not show any difference in survival between the two groups. However,side effects were significantly lower in the group receiving radioactive Iodine 131treatment. Radioactive Iodine 131 treatment was also used in a adjuvant setting in patients resected for HCC without detectable residual disease. A longer delay of recurrence was observed in the treated group (70). Recommendations The use of radioactive Iodine 131 treatment can be used as an alternative for chemoembolization. 12. Treatment of early hepatocellular carcino- ma in patients on the waiting list for liver trans- plantation Liver transplantation is the therapy of choice for cir- rhotic patients with early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The optimal candidates for liver transplantation (single nodule < 5 cm or up to 3 nodules < 3 cm) achieve a 70% 5-year survival rate, with recurrence rate below 15% (59). The prognosis after transplantation is there- fore the same as for a similar underlying disease without HCC. However,these excellent results were obtained at a time when the average waiting time for liver trans- plantation was less than 6 months. But the tumour dou- bling time in asymptomatic HCC less than 5 cm was estimated to be around 4 months (71). Therefore, the delay between diagnosis and transplantation can allow the tumour to grow to stages that contraindicate trans- plantation.",

Chemoembolization is a common adjuvant treatment for patients on the waiting list. This option contributes to accurate staging of the intrahepatic disease and may achieve extensive tumor necrosis (76-80). The procedure is well tolerated in the majority of this subset of patients waiting for transplantation. Furthermore, it has been shown that the prevalence of hepatic arterial thrombosis, a graft-threatening complication of transplantation, was not increased in patients who underwent hepatic arterial chemoembolization before transplantation (76). It is probably the treatment of choice during the waiting list for patient with Child A cirrhosis when percutaneous injection is not feasible. If the waiting time before transplantation is expected to be shorter than 3 months,the interest of adjuvant ther- apies is probably clinically less relevant. If the waiting list exceeds seven months, a decision analysis has shown that living donor liver transplanta- tion is cost effective compared with cadaveric transplan- tation (66). Decision analysis has also shown that surgical resec- tion while waiting for transplantation for patients with single HCC and well preserved hepatic function pro- vides moderate gains in life expectancy and is cost effec- tive only if the waiting list exceeds one year (72). According to the available data, the following deci- sion tree could be proposed for cirrhotic patients with early HCC.",

Percutaneous treatments **Source Type:** clinical_guideline\n\nRecommendations The only proven potentially curative treatment for HCC remains surgery, either hepatic resection for patients with a HCC in a non-cirrhotic liver or liver transplantation for patients with a HCC in a cirrhotic liver. Patients with single small HCC (< 5 cm) or up to three lesions should be referred for these treatment modalities. Surgical resection and percutaneous treat- ment modalities in patients with cirrhosis have the dis- advantage that the remnant liver remains a premalignant condition with the potential to develop new HCC lesions in this part of the liver. • Liver transplantation should be considered in any patient with cirrhosis and a small (5cm or less single nodule or up to three lesions of 3 cm or less) HCC. • Hepatic resection should be considered as primary therapy in any patient with HCC and a non-cirrhotic liver (including fibrolamellar variant). • Resection can be carried out in highly selected patients with hepatic cirrhosis and well preserved hepatic function (Child Pugh A). Such surgery carries a high risk of postoperative decompensation and should be undertaken in units with expertise in hepat- ic resection and management of liver failure. • If surgery or transplantation is not possible, percuta- neous treatment modalities can be used as an alterna- tive. 9. Percutaneous treatments Percutaneous treatments are considered as minimally invasive procedures that constitute the best medical option for non-surgical HCC. Tumour ablation is achieved by using chemical substances (alcohol, acetic acid),or by modifying the temperature of the neoplastic cells (radiofrequency, microwave, laser, and cryoabla- tion) (45).

Of course, the limited availability of donor organs also plays an important role. The available analyses are mainly based on morphometric criteria, i.e. the number and size of tumour nodes. In the case of purely hepatic infection, the risk of recurrence after liver transplantation is correlated with the number (maximum or cumulative) size of existing tumours [151]. The so-called Milan criteria are used as the standard established criterion for the indication for liver transplant in most countries, as well as in Germany [152]. Patients with an unstable HCC within the Milan criteria have a 5-year survival rate of 65 - 80% and an HCCR rate of approximately 10-12% after liver transplants, [153] Therefore, the Milan criterion accepted in Germany also represents a high priority for planning liver transplantations every 3 months. If these criteria continue to be met, the corresponding matchMELD will be upgraded every 3 months.",

Retrospective analyses have shown that TACE outcomes in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival can be improved by further differentiating the indication within the criteria of BC BLC stage. In particular, the size and number of tumour cores and the severity of the dysfunction are of minor importance. The vascularisation of the tumour core plays an important role in the outcome of TACE. Pseudoencapsulation suggests better outcomes than in poorly vascularized and diffuse arterially supplied tumours. Tumor sites at the 'water gap' between arterial supply territories also present increased demands on the interventional treatment technique. This involves high quality intraprocedural imaging, possibly including cone beam CT under arterial perfusion to clarify selective vascularisation. The greater the selectivity of transarterial therapy and the more pronounced and comprehensive the devascularizing effect of the embolization measures, the better the efficacy of TACE and the lesser the side-effect.",

The liver necrosis may be followed by functional decompensation, but if only segmental portal tumor invasions are present and there are favourable conditions for selective arterial devascularization with segmental or subsegmental implementation of TACE, this can be done efficiently and with low side effects. Adapted supportive therapy should be performed before, during and after TACE. This requires adequate analgesia, anthemesis, hydration, antibiotics if necessary. Conventional Lipiodol-TACE and Drug-eluting Beadogen TACE can be used as approximately equivalent procedures depending on the individual risk profile and preferences of the treatment (see Appendix). Therefore, a preference for this treatment technique can be considered in patients who are at particular risk in this regard. To date, no evidence has been provided that drug-eluting bead TACE improves the survival prognosis of patients compared to conventional TACE. 3.4 Operative and interventional therapeutic procedures 84 For TACE, anthracyclines (doxorubicin, epirubicin) or platinum derivatives should be used [300].

Since TACE is normally indicated in patients with multiple and/ or large tumour centres in stage B BCLC, it may need to be repeated to achieve complete devascularisation of all tumour clusters. The aim is to achieve full devascularization of all tumor centres while largely preserving the non-affected hepatic parenchyma. This requires numerous selective and super-selective catheterizations using microcatheters and sometimes complex intra-procedural diagnostics. The amounts of emboli and cytostats applied in a therapy session are limited to avoid adverse reactions and limit complications. In particular, no more than 10 to 15 ml should be administered in a post-intervention course within 4 weeks of TACE administration. A post-interventional follow-up should be performed within 4-12 weeks after TACE, requiring adequate residual treatment with contrast-enhanced biphasic arterial and portal venous contrast CT or MRI followed by mRECIST-compliant assessment of remission. Therapeutic options should be re-evaluated in an interdisciplinary tumour conference in the following situations: • regularly after 2 TACE; • increasing obliteration of tumour-supplying arterial vessels, resulting in a lack of arterial access to the tumour; • reaching a cumulative dose of 450 mg/ m2 doxorubicin; • the occurrence of contraindications, such as significant deterioration of liver function, extrahepatic metastasis, tumour invasion of large portal or hepatic veins, worsening of the general condition of patients with tumour related symptoms (OG/ EC = 2).",

Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer worldwide. According to current GLOBOCAN data, more than 905 000 people worldwide fell ill with a primary liver tumor (HCK and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) in 2020 and more than 830 000 died from it [http:\\\\gco.iarc.fr]. The most common risk factors for HCC in Germany are currently chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and alcohol consumption. The incidence of HCC has increased significantly in the Western world due to chronic HCV infection-related cirrhosis of the liver as well as the significant increase in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Hepatitis (NASH) with advanced fibrosis or cirrosis. Cohort studies have shown that approximately 1-8% of all patients with cirrhosis develop HCC (2% for HBV, 3-8% for HCV) [3], [4], [5] whereas in NAFLD or NASH the incidence of HCC varies greatly (0.004 - 7.6%) [6]. In NAFLD or NASH, on the other hand, the incidence of HCC varies greatly (0.004 - 7.6%) [6],[7].",

These parameters must be captured by careful macroscopic and histological processing and represented in the finding. Findings from explanted livers must be able to derive the transplantation-relevant criteria, as they represent important information for the assessment of recurrence risk. Clinical staging systems, such as BCLC, CLIP or JIS, cannot be represented alone in the histological finding. For tumor grading, various international grading systems are used. the AFIP grading [110], while more recent proposals prefer a 3-stage grading [108]; there is no global consensus. Regardless of the grading system used, the grade has prognostic relevance after resection and transplantation. As a synthesis of the different grading systems and for unification, the new WHO classification proposes a new 3-member grading, the use of which is recommended [105].

The screening involves deciding at what level the risk of HCC should be high enough to trigger screening, what screening test to carry out and how often it should be carried out. Finally, deciding what action an abnormal screen test should trigger. The risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis over a period of 5 years is about 7%. Since some groups of patients with Chronic Hepatitis B have an increased incidence of hepatocell carcinomas (hCC) even without having developed cirrhotic disease, screening for HCC should be performed in patients who have a family history of HCC, Asian patients over 40-50 years of age, and African patients over the age of 25 years. Of the available studies used to screen for HCC, measurement of the tumor marker Alphafetoprotein (AFP) has been shown to be inadequate as a screening method. Most studies have used 6-month intervals between controls, there are no randomised trials that have established the optimal screening interval. Nodules larger than 1 cm found by imaging of a cirrhotic liver should be examined with either a 3-phase CT scan or a dynamic contrast-enhanced one. If the appearance of the lesions is typical for HCC, the diagnosis of HCC may be made. If diagnostic imaging findings are not characteristic, a second contrast enhanced examination should be performed with another imaging diagnostic modality (MR/CT or contrast enhancement in expert centers) or an ultrasound measurement should be made from a coarse biopsy reading algorithm (see above).

The Milan criteria or AFP criteria are not used in non-cirrhotic patients with HCC. If the tumours are not resectable and the patient does not exhibit extrahepatic metastasis, the patient should be assessed for hepato-transplantation (C) 15. The following is a summary of Recommendations for liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma: an international consensus conference report (71). Other recent key references (72, 73). Liver transplantation should be reserved for patients with 5-year survival comparable to that of non-HCC patients, i.e. approximately 70%. Prognosis is assessed primarily on the basis of the diameter of the largest tumour and the number of tumours in the liver. There must be no extrahepatic tumour. Microinvasion is a very poor prognostic sign and there is some correlation to tumour size and number as well as certain biomarkers; however, there are no reliable, either radiological or biomarker methods to detect microinvision, which is why microbial invasion is not yet included in the selection of liver transplants. However, if one could use multiple criteria to validate the prognosis of patients with micro-transplantation, we will be able to use a better prognosis for those patients with non-AFPs (see below). In non-cirrhotic patients, liver transplantation should be considered on a case-by-case basis as an alternative to resection if the tumour is confined to the liver, irrespective of its size and number.",

Stereotactic radiation therapy (SBRT) provides precise radiation to a well-defined target volume, usually with few fractions and a high dose per fraction. Phase I and Phase II studies of SBRT of HCC show that radiation treatment can be administered with low risk and limited side effects to patients with Child Pugh A, maximum tumour diameter of 5 cm and adequate liver volume (83). Several publications show that children with Child-Pugh B and C developed irreversible liver failure, which is why those with child Pugh scores > 7 are not recommended for stereotactic irradiation (84, 85).

Algorithms for the examination of small nodes found by screening or other imaging in patients at risk of HCC in cirrhotic liver (MDCT = Multi-Detector CAT scan). Diagnosis of HCD in patients without liver cirrhosis In a normal liver without cirrosis, the likelihood of developing HCC is much lower and the guidelines given cannot be used in these cases. In the normal liver, hypervascular processes with venous hout wasta represent metastases from primarily vascularized mammary tumors, such as carcinomas, renal cell carcinoma or neuroocrine tumors. If a primary tumor with the same vascular profile is not known, a biopsy is necessary to make a histological diagnosis. 18F-FDG, the most widely used PET tracer in oncology, has a sensitivity of approximately 50-65% for intrahepatic HCC, whereas some studies find a slightly higher sensitiveness for extrahepaticHCC. A number of other PET tracers, including 68Ga-PSMA, 11C/18F-choline and 11C-Acetate, have been shown in smaller studies to have a higher sensitisation for HCC than 18Ga-FG, especially in tumors with FDG uptake. More recent studies with 68 Ga-F were able to find a similarly higher intra-pathogenic and intra-hepatogenic HAPI, as well as other studies with both 18F/FG and extra-hepatic T cells, such as a small study with 18 Ga-PCT, found no evidence of developing an extra radioactive HAPI in the bone marrow (26 or 30).",

HCC occurs in 70-80% of cases in a cirrhotic liver. Objectives The overall aim of the guideline is to support an evidence-based cancer intervention of high and uniform quality across Denmark. Patient group The most common cause of cirrhosis (about 65%) in Denmark is alcohol consumption (2). The incidence and prevalence of cirrosis is relatively stable, but the underlying causes are changing in these years as alcohol-related cirrhomosis and Hep B+C decline, while fat-related Cirrhomoses have an increasing trend. Diagnosis and treatment of HCC involve physicians from different specialties, including medics with internal hepatological expertise (hereinafter referred to as hepato-implantation surgeons), HP/transplantation surgists, oncologists, radiologists, and interventional pathologists. The hepatologist is therefore the central figure in the management of these patients. At any time, the hepatologist must be able to assess liver function and, on this basis, assess which treatment measures the patient will be able best to tolerate. The hepatologists must be responsible for the treatment of liver disease both before and after cancer therapy. Target group for the use of this guideline This guidelines aims primarily at supporting clinical work and the development of clinical quality, which is why it is the primary target group for clinical health professionals working in the Danish healthcare system. Screening for HCC is recommended in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C and demonstrated cirrhosis, as well as in those with cirrhotic hepatitis C eradicated.",

Bilobary HCC can also be treated with resection, possibly in combination with RFA (64). The existence of distant metastases, thrombosis of the venae portae or vena cavae main stem are absolute contraindications to resection or other topical treatment. Liver resection for HCC is accompanied by a perioperative mortality of less than 5% and a morbidity of 30-40%, depending on the patient's liver function. Serious complications such as leukaemia, postoperative softening and gallbladder abscess constitute less than 5%. Note, however, that the incidence of complications and mortality is many times lower at the peripheral end of the tumour than during laparoscopy and should be taken into account, especially in patients who have undergone hepatic ablation in recent years. The 5-year survival after resection for HCC is 35-50% in newer large cohorts (66). The long-term survival for small solitary HCC < 5 cm in diameter is close to 70% (67, 68). The risk of recurrence during the first 5 years after radical resection of HCC, for example, is in the order of 50-80% (69). There is no evidence for adjuvant chemotherapy after liver resection (70). The most effective way of prolonging the survival of patients with re-resection, ablation and/ or transarteriolymbolisation (TACE) is shown to be regressive treatment with regressive re-section and ablation.",

In DEB-TACE, small particles containing Doxolubicin are injeted. The lipoidol and the particles are trapped in the tumour and slowly deliver Doxotubicin to the tumor. TACE and DEB -TACE should be considered for patients with HCC BC up to intermediate stage B, and with a Child Pugh point < 8. Both Tace and Deb-tace induce tumour necrosis in more than 50% of patients (96). Treatment failure has been associated with a significant improvement in tumour survival and should be treated at least 2 times prior to initiating further treatment with TACE. Improvement in survival in treated patients varies between 20-60% after 2 years (97), but it is clear that the relevance of the improvement relative to untreated patients is dependent on the patient' s baseline characteristics in terms of tumour stage, liver function and general health.

This is a fine distinction that is not always possible to make. An additional concern about fine needle biopsy is the risk of bleeding and seeding. Most studies that demonstrate seeding after needle biopsy do not specify the size of the lesion that was biopsied (42, 43). Morphological characteristics can help in the separation of HGDN from HCC, but the addition of special dyes and immunohistochemical dyes is advised. Special staining for reticulin, whereby loss or alteration of reticulation is seen in HCC markers (44) is known. Additionally, by applying a panel of immune histological markers of Glycoprotein 703, Glutamicin 703, and Vitamins 70 can assist in the differentiation of tumors (such as heat shock) from the tumor (diffusion). All 3 negatives can be seen in 100% of low grade dysplastic nodules (LGDN), 73% of high grade dysoplastic nudules (HGdN) and 3% of early HCC. All 3 positives are seen in less than half of early hCC, but no LGDN/HG DN. At 2 positive markers, regardless of which, using this 3-marker panel, the sensitivity and specificity for detection of Early HCC is seen at 72% and 100% respectively in resectates. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining for CD34 can be supplemented to produce capillarization of the sinusoids, which is seen in hepatocytes and particularly in HCC (46).

The most sensitive contrast phases are the arterial phase and the late phase (18), but the portal venous phase is necessary for the assessment of resectability and possible vein thrombosis. In CT and even more so in MRI, other signs may be found to support the diagnosis of HCC: capsule formation, coronary charging, fat content in the tumour, high T2 signal, diffusion restriction or lack of uptake of liver-specific contrast. These signs are not as specific as the typical contrast profile and are not included in the diagnostic algorithm (19-22). When contrast-enhanced ultrasound is not included as a primary modality in the algorithm, it is because intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, which also occurs with greater frequency in cirrhosis patients, can be misdiagnosed as HCC due to gahout contrast-alert washout as opposed to colonoscopy and MRI, where there is no MR (23,24). However, a new, prospective, multicenter study of cirrhosis patients with HCC nodules of 1 to 3 cm comparing CT, MR and contrast ultrasound finds a very high specificity when contrast ultrasonography is used as a supplement to non-inclusive CT or MR.",

AFP may also be increased in patients with chronic liver disease, such as acute and chronic viral hepatitis (49, 50) and increased in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and in colorectal liver metastases (51, 52). Unlike AFP, not all HCCs produce AFP, and the serum concentration of AFP is normal in up to 40% of patients with HCC (53).",

Recommendations are graded in 3 categories according to the level of evidence of data found in the literature.Results: The diagnosis and staging of HCC is essentially based on clinical, biological and imaging features. A pathological analysis obtained by a biopsy of tumoral and non-tumoral liver is rec- ommended. HCCs can be divided into 2 groups, taking into account not only the tumor stage, but also liver function. HCCs accessible to curative treatments are tumors that are in Milan criteria or with an AFP score ≤ 2, mainly treated by surgical resection, local ablation or liver transplantation. Intermediate and advanced HCCs with no liver insufﬁciency, accessible only to palliative treatments, beneﬁt from TACE, SIRT or systemic therapy according to the presence or absence of macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. Conclusion: Such recommendations are in permanent optimization and each individual case must be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert board.",

Assessment of tumor extensionBeyond physical exam and AFP dosing, tumor assessment should include an abdominal MRI combined with a chest CT-scan or a thoraco-abdominal CT-scan, in order to assess tumor morphology (location, number and size of nodules), portal vascularization, and identify pathological lymph nodes or visceral metastasis (lungs, bones, adrenal glands . . .). Brain CT-scan and bone scintigraphy must only be per- formed in case of clinical suspicion of metastasis.

How- ever , French cohorts showed that surgery does not provide OS beneﬁt compared to sorafenib in this setting [33]. Ideally, resection of HCC should consist in an anatomical resection with margins of 2 cm [34,35] .In the absence of advanced liver ﬁbrosis, resection is the gold standard and the possibilities are greater than in cirrhotic patients, even for large tumors [36].Local ablationPercutaneous ablation is an alternative to surgery, usually well tolerated, without signiﬁcant amputation of non- tumoral parenchyma. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation are the most performed techniques and are possible if the tumor is accessible to puncture guided by US or CT and located away from the hilum and large bile ducts. Biliodigestive anastomosis or signiﬁcant ascites are contraindications to local ablation.Local ablation represents an effective alternative to surgery for small HCCs under certain conditions. To date, 6 randomized studies [37—42] and 6 retrospective studies [43—48] with propensity score analysis compared surgery with RFA. Most of these studies have limited statistical power because of the small number of patients. Among the ran- domized studies, only 2 studies were positive in OS and 3",

The added value of sorafenib in patients treated with SIRT has been evaluated in the SORAMIC trial compar- ing the association SIRT and sorafenib versus sorafenib alone\n[77]. The intent to treat population analysis was negative, with a median OS of 12.1 months with the combination com- pared to 11.5 months with sorafenib monotherapy (HR: 1.01; p = 0.93). Finally, the STOP-HCC study is evaluating SIRT prior to sorafenib vs sorafenib alone in the treatment of patients with unresectable HCC [78].In view of these negative studies, the place of SIRT in the therapeutic strategy is not yet deﬁned. Despite these negative results, the French authorities approved the use of SIRT with Therasphere®in HCC with portal vein thrombosis, in patients with a good PS, Child-Pugh A and ineligible (or after failure) to sorafenib. This decision is based on ret- rospective data suggesting a beneﬁt of SIRT in HCC with vascular invasion excluding truncular portal invasion [79]. The opportunity to use SIRT in this indication must be dis- cussed in a multidisciplinary meeting, keeping in mind the availability in second line of validated systemic therapies.Medical treatmentsSeveral systemic agents have shown survival beneﬁts in phase III studies carried out in patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score A), in good general condition (PS 0-2), and advanced HCC (BCLC C or B not eligible for TACE). a.",

Introduction\nThese guidelines are a collaborative work under the aus- pices of most of French medical societies involved in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim was to develop practical recommendations using only methodologically established evidence-based guidelines or primary evidence, and to achieve an interdisciplinary consensus. A writing multidisciplinary committee (from 8 medical societies), including experts from different special- ties involved in the management of HCC (hepatic surgeon, pathologist, radiation oncologist, medical oncologist and hepatogastroenterologists), reviewed recent literature until May 2020 and wrote a ﬁrst document. which was modi- ﬁed after further interactive discussions. The last version was ﬁnally validated by the steering committee of the participating national societies. The present paper is a summary of the French intergroup guidelines published in March 2019 on the website of the SNFGE society\nhttps://www.snfge.org/tncd . Level of evidence was graded according to standard deﬁnition (grade A: large meta analysis or large randomized trial; grade B: small random- ized trials; Grade C prospective non randomized study).When no scientiﬁc evidence was available, recommenda- tions were based on an expert opinion (agreement or not).",

In patients with Child-Pugh B liver cirrhosis and multifocal B tumours, the APR may only be considered in very well selected cases. The prognosis of patients with HCC and Child-Pugh C liver cirrhosis is mainly dictated by the liver failure caused by the cirrhotic disease. Consequently, the only treatment for these patients is liver transplantation. When transplantation is not possible, patients with hCC and child-pugh C hepatic cirrosis should receive the best supportive therapy as any locoregional treatment will induce further liver failure, worsening the prognosis for such patients. For these patients there is no evidence of benefit from the application of systemic treatments. Several studies suggest that combined treatments (TACE + percutaneous ablation) increase tumour response to locoregional therapy, extending the volume of tumour necrosis achievable. The meta-analysis of four small randomised trials comparing single and combined treatment showed a survival advantage with the use of combined therapies61 (Level of evidence 1+). The combined approach allows maximum flexibility in the treatment and retraction of each individual nodule, or in the event of the appearance of a new lesion.",

Several observational studies, including some Italian ones, have given results consistent with the Asian data, confirming that half-yearly surveillance4 (level of evidence 2++) is effective in cirrhotic patients (considered at risk for annual incidence of HCC at around 2-45.6%) (Class of Evidence 2++). Advanced age (over 70-75) is not in itself a reason not to recommend periodic monitoring, as it does not preclude subsequent treatment8 (Level of Evidence 2+). The addition of periodic alpha-fetoprotein dosing to ultrasound surveillance does not substantially increase (approximately 6%) the rate of recognition of HCC at an early stage and significantly worsens the cost-effectiveness of surveillance, increasing the number of false positives (Leval of Evidences 2+) However, monitoring of the semihyperfetoma may not reduce the patient's risk of hypersensitivity to monitoring, except in the absence of available instruments. However, it remains an indicator of the risk of developing HCC and should be dosed at the time of detection of a focal liver lesion on cirrhosis to contribute to the diagnostic and prognostic framework. Strength of recommendation Clinical recommendation clinical SIGN recommendation All patients with cirrhotic liver disease should be B monitored semi-annually with Positive weak upper abdominal ultrasound for early diagnosis of HCC.

In cirrhotic patients with HCC limited to the liver and with good residual liver function, treatment should aim, where possible, at the eradication of the neoplasm. A first consideration should be whether the patient is eligible for a liver transplant as this procedure represents a cure for both HCC and the underlying cirrhosis. However, in practice, liver transplantation is applicable to a very small fraction of cirrotic HCC patients due to clinical and oncological limitations associated with organisational and social considerations. Therefore, given the limited availability of organs, the use of transplantation must be based on the concept of equity between the different categories of patients and cannot disregard the calculation of the benefit of survival provided to the individual patient with transplantation compared to the expected results with other possible anticancer treatments The best survival results (75-80% at 5 years) after liver transplantation for HCC on hepatic cirrhosis are in patients who meet the Milan criteria, i.e. a single neoplasm ≤ 5 cm or multiples of no more than 3 nodes and diameter ≤ 326 cm (Level 2++).",

For the role of palliative analogy in the patient, the above-mentioned clinical trial can play an important role in the development of chemotherapy.

Overall survival (6.40 vs 4.97 months, HR = 0.80, p = 0.07), for the FOLFOX4 regimen compared to doxorubicin71. In detail, the study provided for the randomization of patients with advanced and/ or unresectable HCC, assigning 184 patients to receive FOLVOX4, in the classical schedule every 2 weeks, and 187 patients receiving doxorubicine, at a dose of 50 mg/ m2 every 3 weeks. It should be noted that the study population has different characteristics from Western patients with HCC: over 90% of the randomized patients had HCC related to hepatitis B virus infection while just over half of the patients were cirrhotic and of the latter 89% had good liver function (Child-Pugh). These results cannot be extrapolated to Western patients who are largely affected by hepatic cirrhosis and generally have worse liver function than the patients in the study. In addition to highlighting the diversity - in terms of disease characteristics and prognosis - of Asian patients compared to Western patients, it should be recalled above all that the study in question adopted a control arm (doxorubicin) which, at present, is not the standard and cannot be considered an adequate control for these patients.",

The studies conducted are often characterized by low patient numbers and have produced conflicting results. A recent Cochrane systematic review concluded that there is no clear evidence of efficacy for any adjuvent approach.62 (Level of evidence 1+). Some meta-analyses have instead confirmed a survival benefit obtainable with antiviral therapy in viral patients, due to its favorable effect on disease progression and mortality not related to HCC (L63 (L1+) evidence). Patients undergoing surgical or percutaneous ablative treatment who have shown a complete response are recommended to undergo a low-contrast positive imaging method every three months for the first two years and every six months thereafter. Advanced HCC is characterized by the presence of portal vein thrombosis and/or metastasis. In these cases there is no indication for locoregional treatments as it is a systemic disease. Some highly specialized surgical centers have proposed and perform portal thrombectomy associated with hepatic resection of HCC, especially in cases where the portal invasion is limited to the branches of order II and III. However, there are no data indicating that this procedure is superior or equivalent to treatment with sorafenib.",

For these patients, liver transplantation should also be considered immediately. If they are not transplantable, they may be susceptible to other therapies, but the choice must be very careful, individualized and absolutely managed within a multidisciplinary team, because of the risk of precipitating irreversible liver failure. Since cancer treatments for HCC can cause changes, at least temporary, in portal pressure, every patient with HCC on cirrhosis should undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) for signs of portal hypertension and for the gradation of bleeding risk from varicose veins, before the start of oncological therapy. In the management of the treatment of a patient with HCC, consideration should be given not only to the level of liver function but also to the possible treatment of the cause of the HCC. There are currently a number of medicines available for treatment of cirrhotic stage HBV infection, in the category of nucleotide analogues. A patient with replicating HBV virus cirrhosis complicated by HCC should be treated immediately with antiviral therapy for HBV, especially in anticipation of oncological treatments21.

Therefore, the prognosis of patients with HCC is conditioned not only by the spread of the neoplasm, but also by the residual liver function. This explains why staging systems that take into account only the liver function (Child-Pugh) or only the extent of neoplasia (TNM) do not allow to obtain satisfactory prognostic indications in HCC patients. A correct assessment of cirrhosis and residual liver function is essential not only for prognostic purposes, but also to avoid that treatment of the tumour leads to impairment of liver function such as to compromise the potential benefits of antineoplastic action or even to reduce life expectancy compared to natural history.",

This Directive focuses on what is the best care for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to current standards. It covers the following topics: Surveillance, diagnosis, stereotactic radiotherapy, palliative system therapy, radiation embolization, surgery, follow-up and aftercare. Who is this directive aimed at? The Directive applies to all adult patients with HCC and to adult patients at increased risk of HCC who need to be included in a surveillance programme. The Directive is limited to patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis where this is indicated. Scope The Directive addresses all professionals involved in second or third line surveillance, diagnosis and treatment and counselling of patients with Hepatocellulare carcinomas. For hepatocell carcinom patients, this Directive is a care system in the form of surgical diagnosis, treatment and how to deal with liver cancer. How did the directive come about? The initiative for the directive came from the Dutch Association of Gastrointestinal and Liver Doctors (NVMDL). The directive was drafted by a multidisciplinary committee with representatives from the Netherlands Internists Association, Dutch Association for Healology, Netherlands Association for Nuclear Medicine, Dutch Society for Pathology, Dutch Radiology Association, Netherlands Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology, The Netherlands Association of Liver Patients and Nurses & Caregivers Netherlands.

Detection only for better survival The Health Council states in its report that early detection of new manifestations of cancer should be found only for gains in duration or quality of life (Health Council, 2007) Earlier detection is effective at an early stage rather than at a later stage if symptoms have arisen. Early detection should only be carried out in a programmatic approach. Depending on the literature of the HCC, and whether a small tumour needs to be treated locally or undergo a local reassessment, early treatment for HCC patients requires a translation to a local review. If primary HCC was accompanied by elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), AFP may be used in follow-up for hepatocellular carcinoma detection of recurrent disease.

Lenvantib is non-inferior to soravenib. The overall robustness of the literature within the first-line treatments was rated as low and very low. This is related to the inaccuracy of the findings (small number of studies) and limitations in study design (risk or bias). Row 2:\nHepato cellular cancer: For the second-line treatment, one RCT was found, comparing regorafenib with placebo (Bruix, 2017). The systematic literature analysis shows that treatment with regoraffenib could have positive effects on risk and overall survival. Due to the outcome of tumour responses, complications, and lack of evidence based on clinical findings, the overall literature findings were considered to be inaccurate due to the low quality of life. Survival gains from these groups together were statistically significant but did not meet the old PASKWIL criteria (OS of 10.2 versus 8.0 months; Δ 2.2 months, HR: 0.76; 95%-BI: 0.63 to 0.92; P = 0.005).

Recommendation Recommandation-1 Consider including the patient at significantly increased risk for HCC in a surveillance programme. This includes the possibility of HCC therapy in case of detection and the a priori likelihood of developing HCC and the prevalence of benign nodules in this patient. Therefore, a good result is not a guarantee that there is no abnormality. Approximately 1 to 2 out of 10 people participating in liver cancer surveillance will receive a ' false alarm ' at some point within three years. This may lead to stress, unnecessary (retrospective) additional examinations and a small risk of complications. *Consider abandoning surveillance in the absence of cirrhosis, positive family history, viral coinfection or metabolic risk cofactors in the event of a low mPAGE-B score and tenofovir/ entecavir treatment. The mPAGEB score is the sum of each component, ranging from 0 to 21.",

Due to positive results from studies with immunotherapy combination in palliative HCC, the possibility of pre-operative systemic therapy is also being studied. Evidence is currently limited to minor and II studies with few patients included and therefore not recommended in routine care [354, 355]. Treatment with neoadjuvant systemic oncology therapy is not recommended within the framework of clinical trials. The risk of recurrence following curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma is relatively high, with approximately 70% of recurrences occurring within 5 years of surgery [77]. The risk factors for recurrence are tumour size > 5cm, multiple tumours in the liver, vascular invasion and low differentiation [356]. A number of essential venous diseases have been studied, but no studies exist at present to support a therapeutic indication. Systemic therapy should be offered to patients with good functional status (WHO PS 0-1) with good hepatic function (Child Pugh A). For patients with more marginal liver function (child B7) there is no absolute limit, but individual assessment should be made. Clinical ascites or encephalopathy are contraindications, as well as elevated bilirubin above about 50, while albumin levels, which can be influenced by many factors, are of minor importance. Diagnosis of possible portal hypertension and especially treatment of varicose veins in the esophagus should precede the start of systemic therapy, see section 8.4.2 Liver function evaluation and 13.1 Cirrhosis complications.",

Transarterial therapies (see section 11.5 Transartery Locoregional Therapy) presuppose, as do curative treatments, that the tumour burden is confined to the liver, but may be given in multifocal tumour disease. Transarteral treatments are not considered to be curative treatment alone, even if a complete response can be achieved. However, transartery therapy may also be used for the purpose of tumour suppression pending liver transplantation or first downging. Systemic oncological therapy (see Section 11.6 Systemic treatment) may be used in advanced HCC, such as metastasis or malignancy, taking into account overall cardiac function, liver disease and co-morbidity. In addition, there are some limitations with regard to portal thrombosis. Ablation is considered a potentially curative treatment and requires a smaller tumor, limited to the liver, adequate liver function, and technical conditions to perform the ablation without harming nearby structures. Ablation provides an equivalent survival rate and is associated with fewer complications, shorter care time, and less resource availability than resection [227-229]. Local treatment minimizes the volume of healthy liver that is removed. The disadvantages are that the risk of incomplete tumor destruction and local recurrence is higher than for central resection.

In the case of hepatic impairment or limited multifocal disease, liver transplantation is preferable, but requires limited comorbidity. In large singular tumor, liver resection is often possible, but presupposes good liver function. In established HCC less than 3 cm, ablation is the first choice, thanks to good tolerability and low complication rate, which can allow treatment even for fragile patients. In choosing between resection or ablation, several factors must be weighed in addition to size, such as localization, co- morbidity and hepatic function. Ablation with increased risk of local recurrence, but it should be weighted against the possibility of reintervention, lower morbidities and cost [227-229]. In the case of HCC in a non-cirrhotic liver, resection/ablation is a first-line option. The prerequisite for resection is that it can be performed radically (R0) without causing hepatic failure. Laparoscopic surgery has been shown to provide shorter treatment time with the same oncological outcome compared to open surgery in a randomised study in HCC < 5 cm. In small tumours, < 3 cm, ablation may be an appropriate option even in non-chirrhotical liver, but it requires that the diagnosis is established earlier or can be confirmed by biopsy in conjunction with the intervention (see section 8.2 Radiological diagnosis of hCC). However, transplantation may only be offered to patients with tumour burden within selection criteria (see section 11.4 Liver Transplantation (LTx) in HCC). Resection/ablation is usually the first choice in patients with cirrhosis and preserved liver function, Child-Pugh A, especially at Child- Pugh 5 and less tumour-burden, as the differences in 5-year survival compared to transplantation are limited [232-234]. assessments at a multidisciplinary conference.",

The RCC has developed a practical guide to be used as support in conversations about CAM: If you are considering complementary or alternative medicine. Patients with HCC often have an underlying liver disease and sometimes impaired liver function. In liver cirrhosis, patients should be advised against complementary treatment with herbal remedies or supplements as there is a risk of liver effects from several preparations, many of which are unknown. A meta-analysis shows that discontinuing alcohol consumption preoperatively reduces the number of postoperative complications (Cochrane review). There is also an association between high consumption of alcohol or tobacco and worsened prognosis after the diagnosis of HCC. The association is likely to be strongest at early detection of surgically treatable HCC, and where one has a longer survival [451]. Alcohol consumption >20 grams/day (equivalent to >10 standard glasses/week) has been shown in a Japanese study to worsen the prognosis for patients with HCC [452]. Smoking, among other things, has been associated with an increased risk of cholangitis after liver transplantation [453]. Generally, therefore, the patient may be recommended to stop smoking and to refrain from alcohol intake during surgery, as well as adequate post-surgical treatment of the liver. • When it is clear that there is no cure for the disease, the patient should be offered a consultation to discuss the content of continued care based on the patient' s condition, needs and wishes (serious illness consultation). • When life- prolonging measures are clearly not possible, a breakthrough assessment should be made by the physician in charge.",

When ablation isn't appropriate due to localization or tumor size, but liver function is well preserved, resection is recommended. In case of multiple tumors or recurrence of HCC (no local recurrence) after previous resection or ablation, liver transplantation should be considered [230], as the risk of recurrence is lower after transplantation.

According to data from SweLiv, > 2/3 of all patients diagnosed with HCC in Sweden between 2012 and 2022 had underlying liver disease. the actual rate of underlying liver cirrhosis among patients with HCC is thus higher than previously reported.[2] Similarly, MASLD is an increasing and often underestimated cause of HCC in Sweden [17]. Underlying MASLD should always be suspected in patients with hCC who do not have other known predisposing liver diseases, but who also have type 2 diabetes and/or obesity, especially in association with other metabolic co-morbidities such as hypertension, high blood lipids or coronary artery disease [7].",

Radiological methods are important for early documentation of objective signs of treatment response that correlate with survival. A disadvantage of the standard method RECIST in HCC is that there are effective treatments, such as some locoregional modalities and targeted drugs, that do not affect the size of tumors and where the clinical effect of treatment is therefore not captured [175]. The problem of the absence of tumor shrinkage was addressed with the introduction of the concept of viabletumor in the modified RECISTM criteria (mRECIST) [176]. Tumor viability is defined radiologically as the remaining contrast-suppressing area in the tumor I. Instead of measuring the maximum length of the tumor according to the MRCIST 1.1 method, the maximum diameter of the longest diametrical remaining area (MRCIST) or the maximum time remaining in the intermediate stage (TACRISTM) in the region after complete non-absorption or contraception of the HCC (T) is measured by TACRIST 1. However, several studies have shown that response (=ORR, overall response rate) after locoregional treatment as measured by mRECIST predicts survival (OS) [177]. The first control with DT or MRI is usually done after 1 3 months [178]. mRICIST is also used in studies of systemic treatment of HCC. However, at advanced HCC, international guidelines recommend both mRECTIST and conventional RECIST [179]. post-treatment response in LR-TR viable (definitely or probably viable), LR- TR equivocal (oclar viability) and LR-RT nonviable. LR-Tr viable is defined as nodular, expansive or thick, irregular tissue with any of: • arterial phase recharge • washout • contrast recharge similar to that before treatment. Expected patterns of contra-recharge after treatment, such as thin recharge in the periphery of the lesion after embolization, should be characterised as LR-T R non viable.",

HCC sometimes grows in a severely restricted, diffuse manner, which is both an unfavourable prognostic factor in itself and increases the difficulty of both identifying the tumour and assessing tumour spread [193]. The number of tumours can sometimes be difficult to estimate, partly due to the growth of the tumour and partly because of the common occurrence of multiple foci with varying characteristics (see section 8.2 Radiological diagnosis of HCC). This can have a major impact on treatment planning. Limits based on tumour number exist for all curative treatments, although an exact limit is difficult to give. Smaller tumours connected to a larger one are sometimes described as satellites, but in principle should be considered as separate tumours.

Several studies have shown that regular coffee consumption is related to a reduced risk of HCC in chronic liver disease, therefore regular coffee drinking is recommended. Coffee has an antioxidant effect, and daily coffee consumption may have a protective effect. However, no clear recommendations can be made regarding daily coffee volumes [54-61]. For tea, data are more limited and contradictory, therefore specific recommendations cannot be made. Smoking cessation should be recommended for all patients with chronic liver disease; cigarette smoking has been associated with an increased risk of both liver fibrosis and HCC [62, 63].",

The occurrence of peritoneal tumour breakthrough should always be reported and affects the T-stage of HCC, but is not considered for categorization of R-status, as the peritonal surface is not a surgical resection surface [224]. Preoperative treatment (e.g. TACE, RFA) is often performed prior to transplantation. Although established international guidelines for assessing the cause of regression of tumours in HCC are established, prognosis is also dependent on the degree of severity of the tumour and the percentage of remaining HCC cells present in the liver after chronic resection. The prognosis after resection of HCC is also dependent on the presence and severity of underlying chronic liver disease. It is important to assess this as far from the tumor as possible to avoid confusing peritumoral effects. Fibrosis stage, activity grading (according to Batts and Ludwig for chronic hepatitis or scoring system for steatohepatitis) and steatosis should be reported according to the Swedish Association of Pathology KVAST document Improvement and diagnosis of medical liver biopsies [214]. Mixed hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CCC) is defined as a tumor containing unambiguously, intimately mixed elements of both hepatocelllular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. Collision tumors are not considered to be mixed neoplasms. A minimum amount of each component (the HCC and CCC respectively) has not been established and the diagnosis should be made even if one component predominates. The proportion of every component is reported.",

For this reason, attempts have been made to create scoring systems that estimate the risk of HCC, such as PAGE-B, CAGE-G, SAGE­B, etc., but they currently provide insufficient guidance for validation, as there are no Asian patients in the population without surveillance and some patients, for example, have a risk factor of over 40 years of age without HCC [113-118]. Factors that increase the risk of HCC in carriers of chronic hepatitis B: • East and Southeast Asian or African ancestry • male gender • increasing age • presence in a close relative • high levels of hepatitis B DNA (> 20,000 IU/ ml) • active inflammation with high ALT levels • advanced fibrosis (stage F3) [119, 120] • hepatitis B virus genotype C • long duration of infection • co-infection with hepatitis C or D • previous exposure to aflatoxin • diabetes mellitus. In chronic hepatitis C, 1520% are estimated to develop cirrhosis of the liver after 20 years. With persistent viremia, the incidence of HCC in Europe in hepatitis C-related cirrhotic disease is approximately 3% per year [110, 121, 122]. The risk of HCH is correlated to the degree of fibrosis as measured by elastography [123]. HCC monitoring is recommended for patients with hepatitis C-related cirrhosis with both active and extinct hepatitis C. The recommendation for extinguished hepatitis C applies to patients assessed prior to treatment as having cirrhotic liver disease (based on clinical findings, biochemistry and elastography, or liver biopsy), even in cases where the liver cell count decreases to < 12.5 kPa after successful treatment. There is no current knowledge on when and in which subgroups HCC surveillance may be discontinued as HCC can also occur in liver cells with normalized liver cell counts after excretion [126].",
