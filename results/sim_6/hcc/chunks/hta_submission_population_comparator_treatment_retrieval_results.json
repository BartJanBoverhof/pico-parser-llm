The study included\nadults with HCC in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B or C who did not receive any prior systemic therapy for the advanced or inoperable disease. Hepatic cirrhosis of any\naetiology was not an exclusion criterion. Patients in BCLC stage B had to be ineligible for\ntransarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Further inclusion criteria were Child-Pugh stage A\nand an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group – Performance Status (ECOG-PS) score of 0 or 1. Overall, 478 patients were placed in the lenvatinib arm and 476 in the sorafenib arm of the study. Randomization was stratified by the criteria of region (Asia-Pacific/Western regions),\nECOG-PS (0/1), body weight (<60 kg/≥60 kg) and the presence of macroscopic portal vein invasion (MPVI) and/or extrahepatic spread (ES) (yes/no).

This\nappraisal was a Cancer Drugs Fund reconsideration of the published NICE technology appraisal guidance on sorafenib for treating advanced\nhepatocellular carcinoma. 3.2 The company's original submission presented clinical effectiveness data\nfrom the SHARP study.

The results of the respective votes are assigned to recommendations according to the categories in Table 9. For all evidence-based statements (see Section 2.2.3) and recommendations, the guideline indicates the level of evidence (see 2.2.1) of the underlying studies, as well as the strength of the recommendation (recommendation grade). In terms of strength of recommendation, there may be three different recommendations in this Guideline Recommendation (see Table 8), but the consensus level of support for each recommendation should be at least 50% of the recommended recommendation's strength.

After discontinuation of the study medication, a total of 25.5% of\nLenvatinib (hepatocellular carcinoma) 13 February 2019 patients in the lenvatinib arm and 27.3% in the sorafenib arm received a surgical or other\nmedical intervention, of which TACE was the most common at about 15% (of the total population). About 31% of patients received subsequent systemic therapy, most commonly\nsorafenib, at 25% in the lenvatinib arm and 12% in the sorafenib arm. The primary outcome of the study was overall survival.",

Consequently, there is no hint of an added benefit of lenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib; an added benefit is therefore not proven. Morbidity  Symptoms Outcomes on symptoms were surveyed using the symptom scales of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the disease-specific European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer HCCspecific Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-HCC18). In both cases, time to deterioration, defined as a score increase by at least 10 points over baseline, was examined. For symptoms surveyed by means of the EORTC QLQ-C30, no statistically significant difference between treatment groups was found for either fatigue, nausea and vomiting, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, or constipation. Consequently, for each of these outcomes, there is no hint of added benefit of lenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib; an added benefit is therefore not proven for these outcomes. For the outcome of pain, surveyed using the EORTC QLQ-C30, there is a statistically significant difference in favour of lenvatinib. However, this effect is at most marginal.

New medicines are evaluated in relation to effectiveness, existing treatment and price. It should provide lower prices and medicines that are of maximum benefit to patients. The common regional therapy guidelines are assessments of which medications are most appropriate for the treatment of patients within a therapy area and thus the basis for uniform high quality for patients across hospitals and regions.

Summary: REFLECT quality of evidence **Source Type:** hta_submission\n\nThis would have been confusing for very ill\npatients and would have resulted in a high risk for dosing errors. Nevertheless, REFLECT provides reliable direct comparative safety and efficacy data from a robust, large, multinational, randomised Phase 3 study versus the only relevant approved comparator in first line treatment\nfor advanced unresectable HCC. Furthermore, the applicant created a Data Integrity Protection Plan, which\nensured that relevant data fields were masked so that the clinical and statistical team members were blinded to treatment for each patient in order to minimise bias. In addition, it is stated in the European\nPharmaceutical Assessment Report (EPAR) that the trial was well–conducted. Very few randomised subjects the treatment arms. arm and more subjects with underlying hepatitis C in the sorafenib arm. The EPAR recognised that both of\nthese imbalances may favour the sorafenib arm. Further details are provided in the overall survival section\nThe Medicines Council noted incomplete data for progression-free survival (PFS) due to FDA-preferred analysis used for reporting this efficacy outcome. This has been addressed in the progression-free survival The sparsity of published results for HRQoL was also highlighted by the Council. The primary manuscript (1)\ndid not include full reporting of HRQoL data from the REFLECT study. However, multiple additional\npublished studies are available and these studies have now been included in the updated SLR.

FIGURE 4.1: TRIAL PROFILE [1] A non-inferiority test of overall survival (OS) between lenvatinib and sorafenib was done using a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of hazard ratio (HR) (lenvatinib:sorafenib). The HR and the corresponding 2sided 95% CI were estimated using a Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group as a factor, and stratified by the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors. Superiority hypotheses were tested for OS using a stratified log-rank test with the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors. No multiplicity adjustments were needed for testing of the non-inferiority and superiority of OS due to the closed testing principle. Two interim analyses were performed. Since the study was not stopped at the first or second interim analysis, non-inferiority for OS was tested first at the final analysis with a non-inferiority margin of 1.08, which indicated that lenvatinib preserved at least 60% (corresponding to δ = 0.60) of the sorafenib treatment effect versus placebo as observed in the sorafenib SHARP and Asia-Pacific trials [5,6]. Non-inferiority was declared if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for HR was <1.08 at the final analysis.",

The Committee does not expect that the imbalance between the study arms will have a significant impact on the efficacy estimates. Results and assessment of the endpoints prespecified by the Panel as critical and important, respectively, are as follows: overall survival, OS (critical) Survival is a critical endpoint as HCC is a fatal disease. The Panel wants the endpoint to be expressed as median survival and survival rates at 12 and 24 months. Table 3. Median survival in the lenvatinib arm median overall survival is 13.6 months, compared to 12.3 months in the sorafenib arm. This corresponds to a difference of 1.3 months in favour of lenvatitinib. The SCC has assessed that any difference of 3 months or more is clinically relevant. Lenvatinib does not meet this requirement. The relative difference in efficacy for the median hazard survival ratio (HR) is 0.92 [0.71,06] and shows that there is no statistically significant difference between treatments. Survival rates After 12 months of treatment, 55% of patients are alive in the lenvatinib arm, while the corresponding figure for the sorafenib arm is 50%. Thus, there is a difference of 5 percentage points in favour of lenvitinib. This difference is less than the difference of 8 percentage points defined in the protocol as the least clinically relevant difference.",

Eisai (hereinafter referred to as the applicant) is the marketing authorisation holder of lenvatinib, and on 14.11.2018 submitted an application to the Danish Medical Council for the recommendation of lenvitinib as standard treatment in Danish hospitals for this indication. As part of this application, Amgros, on behalf of the Medical Council, assesses the economic analyses submitted by the applicants as part of the overall application to The Medical Council. This report is the assessment of the submitted financial analyses (the analysis). The purpose of the analysis is to estimate the incremental costs associated with the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or patients with inoperable HCC who have not previously been treated systemically, in terms of the average incremental cost per patient and the overall budgetary implications for the regions of the recommendation of lenvatinib (Lenvima) as standard treatment in Danish hospitals of the indication mentioned. HCC is a less frequently occurring cancer in Denmark. The incidence for the period 2011-2015 is 429 new cases per year. In Denmark, 652 patients had HCC in 2015, which reflects a low survival for this patient group. One-year survival is 37% for men and 40% for women, while five-year Survival is only 9% for men, and 11% for women. Development of HCC occurs most often in patients who have cirrhosis of the liver. The liver function in patients with liver disease is divided by how good the liver function is, and the categories are named in Child-Pugh A, B and C, from best to worst liver function.",

The stages are divided by tumor stage, liver function status, physical status and cancer-related symptoms. Overall, HCC patients are categorized into those with early HCC who benefit from curative therapy, those with intermediate and advanced disease who have benefited from palliative treatments, and finally patients who have terminal disease who are offered symptomatic treatment.[3] Patients with early disease (BCLCC A) are evaluated for surgical removal of the tumor, liver transplantation or percutaneous ablation (destruction of cancer cells by means of subtle chemotherapy or hyper-hypothermia, where in particular radiofrequency (RFA) therapy has been introduced in Denmark) with the possibility of five-year recovery, and have a high incidence of hepatohepatitis over five years, and do not have symptoms and are still dependent on interstitial treatment.[3] About 50-75 percent of the patients with BCC who respond to this treatment have no symptoms or no symptoms are still undergoing treatment with liver cancer (BBCLC A, BCLC A) or in childhood cancer.[3] In the advanced stage (stage C BCLC), patients still have liver function equivalent to Child-Pugh A or B, but are no longer candidates for topical treatment as they have symptoms of cancer and/ or vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread [3]. Thus, they are assessed for 1st line systemic therapy with the multicinase inhibitor sorafenib. Lenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced stage HCC or patients with inoperable HCC who have not previously received systemic treatment. Lenwatinib is a multi-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits growth factor receptors VEGF receptor 1-3, FGF receptor 1-4, and PDGF α, as well as the proto-oncogenes RET and KIT, all of which are central to cancer development.",

The protocol specifies a definition of populations, comparator and efficacy targets to be presented in the final application, as well as the methods to be used for the comparative analysis. Work on the protocol has been initiated based on the interim application for Lenvatinib received on 25.05.2018. Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC) is a less frequently occurring form of cancer in Denmark. The incidence for the period 2011-2015 is 429 new cases per year (303 cases in men; 126 cases in women).[1] Development of HCC occurs most often in patients who have cirrhosis of the liver.[2] The liver function of patients with liver diseases such as cirrhomosis can be divided by how good the liver function is, and is referred to in the categories Child-Pugh A, B and C, from best to worst liver function. At the end of 2015, 652 patients had HCC, which reflects the low survival for this patient group.",

On this basis, they also commented that\ntreatment should be restricted to people with Child-Pugh grade A liver function and performance status of 0 to 2. Taking all the evidence into\naccount, the committee concluded that people with Child-Pugh grade A liver function are the appropriate population for its recommendations for\ntreating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with sorafenib in England. 4.22 The committee understood that the final draft guidance issued during\nthe original appraisal went to an appeal panel. It was aware that the\nappeal panel concluded that there was opportunity to comment on overall survival modelling and dismissed all appeal points. In the final\nguidance the committee therefore concluded that the Weibull distribution should be taken into account in any consideration of uncertainty. © NICE 2024. All rights reserved.

It recognised that Palmer et al. was\na published retrospective cohort study comparing patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in 2 hepatobiliary oncology units in the UK who\neither received funding for sorafenib (n=57) or did not receive funding\n(n=76) before the existence of the Cancer Drugs Fund. The committee\nheard from the company that the decision to fund sorafenib was not based on clinical variables. The committee was aware that there was a\nhigher proportion of patients with metastatic disease in the unfunded group. The committee noted that patients who did not receive funding\nfor sorafenib did not live as long as patients who did have funding. It also\nconsidered that the association between funding and death may be confounded, that is, patients with better prognoses might be more likely\nto receive funding and treatment than patients with poorer prognoses. It\nnoted the ERG's comment that the study was not suitable for decisionmaking. However, the committee could not exclude the possibility of\nresidual confounding and concluded that the data from Palmer were a less robust source of evidence than the GIDEON data, now matched to\nSHARP. It further noted that the parametric curves to extrapolate overall\nsurvival using the Palmer data did not favour a log normal or Weibull distribution over the other.",

The choice of survival function for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and sorafenib was informed directly by IMbrave150 data. Survival for lenvatinib was informed by applying a hazard ratio from the NMA to the function for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. The committee agreed that it would have been preferable to apply the hazard ratio from the NMA for lenvatinib compared with sorafenib to the sorafenib survival function, because the drugs have a similar mechanism of action. However, it wou not expect this to have much effect on cost effectiveness. The committee concluded that it would consider cost-effectiveness results using the log-normal function to model survival, because this was the best-fitting function. But the log-logistic and generalised gamma functions were plausible and should also be considered. © NICE 2024. All rights reserved.

Therefore, the committee concluded that the true estimate o\nlife expectancy with sorafenib compared with best supportive care was likely to lie between the estimates from the log normal and the Weibull\ndistributions, but agreed it was closer to the log normal estimates than the Weibull estimates. 4.26 The committee discussed whether the estimates of treatment duration\nshould come from SHARP (the source of the clinical effectiveness data) or from another source.

The committee noted that in King et al. people with Child-Pug\ngrade A liver function did not live as long as people in SHARP\n(9.5 months compared with 10.7 months).

The ERG explained that it was important to explore the\npotential effect of bodyweight because the dosing of lenvatinib and bevacizumab depend on bodyweight, so it affects associated drug costs.

Regarding first-line treatments, for several years sorafenib was the only systemic treatment available for HCC. While the safety profile of sorafenub was acceptable in the context of this disease, the overall prognosis of HCC with this treatment continued to be unsatisfactory. This led to numerous trials to try to obtain new alternatives. In 2018, the REFLECT trial demonstrated non-inferiority of lenvatinib with respect to lenfenib (25). All patients had locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic CHC, for which they had not received prior systemic therapy. Stratification was performed by geographical region (Asia [excluding Japan] vs. rest of the world), macrovascular invasiveness and/ or dissemination (BC), absenteeism vs. absence of athezolizumab-bevacizumab: sorafenib, open-label, multicentre and international phase III clinical trial comparing a arm of patients treated with the atezolizumab/ bevacizumab combination versus a arm treated with sorapenib. It should be noted that IMbrave150 is the first CHC trial in which a therapeutic option is statistically significantly superior to another treatment compared, rather than to placebo. In both SG and SLP, the combination of sorazumab atevacizumab was superior to affenib. The median survival rate was 84.8% (ICI 95%-80.98) at 6 months and 67.95% (ICIC 61.32) at 12 months; 74.2% at 64, 95% and 72.2% at 12-72 months in the atevazizumab group and 74.1% at 61, 95% at 12-62 months; and 75.2% at 54, 95% at 65, 64, 64, 71, 12 and 12 months.

The estimated clinical benefit would be 5, considering the HR 0.58 and a difference of 9.6 months in SG from the extrapolation of the KM curves (22). The recently published updated analysis of an additional 12 months of follow-up shows somewhat reduced outcomes (HR 0.66 and difference from medians of 5.9 months), but with that benefit the assessment would be maintained (21). DISCUSSION HCC is one of the most impactful neoplasms in terms of morbimortality despite the availability of a screening targeted at risk population and a well-established diagnostic algorithm (23). See Annex, Figure 2. To date, no biomarkers have been identified that serve as predictors of response to one treatment or another, or that are able to predict longer or shorter survival of patients (24). In recent years there have been advances from the therapeutic point of view with several drug positions in the treatment algorithm. In 2008, in the SHARP study, sorafenib achieved a median SG of 10.7 vs. 7.9 months in placebo-treated patients, with a HR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.55-0.87, p < 0.001) (12). In 2009, the Asia-Pacific study (NCT00492752) was published where the SG with soraphenib was 6.5 months vs. 4.2 with placebo with HR 95% of 0.68 (IC 0.5-0.93, p 0.014) - Lenvatinib (Lenvima®): In 2018, in the REFLECT study, lenvatinib achieved an SG of 13.6 vs. 12.3 months with sorafenub.",

According to the latest available data, globally, HCC ranks seventh in incidence and fourth in direct mortality from cancer (1). The incidence of HCC increases with age (exceptionally it occurs before 40 years and the median age at diagnosis in our midst is between 65-70 years), being more frequent in men than in women (2). The rate of incidence is higher in western and south-eastern Africa, where the main etiological factors are hepatitis B and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection.",

MEDICAL NEEDS Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common of the liver cancers (approximately 90%) 1 with an estimated incidence in France of approximately 9,600 new cases per year in 2018 2. This type of liver cancer develops most often on a renal cirrhosis (80% to 90% of cases) of various types (primary hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, diabetes mellitus). The prognosis of primary liver cancer remains one of the worst of all cancers with a 5-year survival rate of less than 15%.3 The management of HCC depends on the stage of the disease and the general condition of the patients4,5,6,7. Unlike other solid tumors, for which the therapeutic decision is made based on the TNM classification, there is no consensus prognostic classification for HCC7. Therefore, several classifications or scores have been proposed including the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 8 classification which has the advantage of enabling a prognosis stratification and proposing a treatment algorithm. When HCC is at an early stage (BC 0-A), patients are generally eligible for curative treatment by surgery, radiosurgery or transplantation. In case of failure, refractory disease or ineligibility for TACE, or in the presence of vascular invasion and/ or extrahepatic injury (advanced stage CLC), treatment with sorafenib is recommended in patients with preserved general condition (ECOG ≤ 2) and preserved hepatic function (Child-Pugh A). In adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (stage BCLC B or C) who have not received prior systemic therapy, the medical need is therefore considered to be partially met by sorafenib. However, there remains a medical need for better tolerated and/ or more effective treatments at this stage of the disease.",

For example, among patients who received post-progression therapy, 77.6% received sorafenib and 9.6% received a clinical trial drug in the lenvatinib group, while 30.4% were re-treated with soraphenib and 24.5% participated in clinical trials. Finally, the superiority of lenvatinib over sorafenib in overall survival was tested but not demonstrated; however, it should be noted that lenvitinib was shown to be superior to Sorafenib on the following ranked secondary endpoints: progression-free survival (7.4 months vs. 3.7 months; Δ = 3.7 month; HR = 0.66; CI [0.57; 0.77]; p < 0.00001), time to progression (8.9 months versus 3.7months; ∆ = 5.2 months; HR= 0.63 ; IC [0.53 ; 0.73]; p< 0.00001) and objective response rate (24.1% vs. 9.2%; Δ = 14.8%; CI = 3.08 OR [2.128; 4.48]; P < 0.0001).",

As these may mainly involve fatigue, bleeding and abdominal pain, most of the patients studied had a Child-Pugh stage liver failure, there are limited data on safety and tolerability in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Experience According to the Periodic Safety Update Report for the first half of 2007, 19,086 patients were treated during that period (8740 commercially and 10,346 in clinical trials). 1The term \" adverse reactions\" refers to complaints and symptoms regardless of cause. Clinical pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely with concomitant use of agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 (midazolam, dextromethorphan, omeprazole). It cannot be excluded that sorafenib increases the concentrations of co-administered P-gp substrates (such as digoxin), CYP2B6 (like bupropion, cyclophosphamide, efavirenz, metronidazole), CYP8C2 (like paclitaxel, amodiaquine, repaglinide), or CYP2C9 (like acetoacetylsalicylate). Conclusion: There is an interaction between the concomitant use of sorafenib and inducers of CYP3A4 activity. There are no data on the efficacy and adverse effects of Sorafenib in children and adolescents. 4.f. Ease of use The recommended dose of soferanib is 400 mg (2 tablets of 200 mg) 2 times a day.

For these patients, no other pharmaceutical treatment costs are available, so that the full cost of using sorabenib is no longer borne by the CHF. The recommended dose of sorafenib is 400 mg twice a day. Treatment should be continued for as long as the patient has medical benefit or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. The manufacturer estimates that the average duration of treatment is 5 months (155 days), based on the average length of treatment in studies with the use of the average dose of Sorafenib in place of 710 mg per day, which was also recorded in two clinical trials, where the cost of the dose was 800 mg. The average cost of treatment with sorafenib is € 135.43 per day (i. e. 1 prescription per month, including VAT, delivery charge and clawback) at a dose of 800 mg per day.",

In 2000, the standardized incidence was 1.6/100,000 men and 0.3/100,000 women. There was no increase over time. Risk factors in Europe are: hepatitis C (60-70%), alcohol consumption (20%), hepatitis B (10-15%) and other (10%).

Cheung (020) 797 88 10 Subject Assessment of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma Dear Mr Klink, In your letter of 6 December 2007, you requested the Health Insurance Council (HIC) to assess whether Nexavar® (sorafenib) is interchangeable with a medicine included in the insured package. If not, you are requested to assess the therapeutic value of this medicine for the indication for which reimbursement has been requested. This medicine is included in Annex 1B of the health insurance regulation and is currently being assessed for the treatment of a new cancer, i. e. This review concerns a new indication, namely the use of sorafenib in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer). You have granted the manufacturer of the medicine Nexavar® an exemption for a pharmaco-economic study. The Pharmaceutical Aid Committee (CFH) of the CVZ has now completed the substantive review. The considerations herein are contained in the CFH Report 08/03 attached as an annex. On the basis of this opinion of CFH and administrative considerations, the CDC has adopted its opinion on Nexavir® (sorafenib) in hepatocell carcinomas. CVZ Opinion The CVZ recommends that you extend the detailed conditions for Nexaver® to Annex 2 of the Health Insurance Regulations. This extension covers a subgroup of patients with hepatotoxicity to sorafenil per year, 164 patients were enrolled in the Netherlands in 1989-2000 (more than one patient per year). Background In the Netherlands, during the period 1989-2000, 1964 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled (an average of 164 patients per year). The 5-year survival rate was 7% and the 1-year survivorship rate was 22%.",

To determine whether sorafenib is also eligible for reimbursement for the new indication, the therapeutic value has been determined and the cost of inclusion estimated (see below). 2.a.3. 2.a.4 Conclusion Therapeutic value In the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, sorafenib has a therapeutical added value 2.a.5 Assessment of effectiveness For the assessment of efficacy, a waiver was granted due to the relative rarity of the condition and the lack of effective treatment methods 2.a.6 Cost-effectiveness. In the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in whom intentionally curative treatment or (continuation of) locoregional or local palliative treatment is not possible or is not considered medically meaningful, sorafenib has a therapeutic added value. The CFH came to the following conclusions: Based on the limited literature available, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma for whom intentional curative treatment or (continuation of) locoregional or local survival therapy is not possible or considered medically unsuitable ( advanced hepatocellulose), had a longer survival if palliative effects were observed than in patients with advanced disease. Treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who have failed previous therapy based on interferon alfa or interleukin 2 or who are considered unsuitable for this therapy.",

The annual incidence of this type of cancer is 1/10,000 residents. Iodine-refractory cancer affects 2/3\nof patients with distant metastases who did not achieve a complete response during iodine therapy. This\ncondition is extremely rare and affects 4-5 patients in 1 million (about 250 people per year in France). The natural course of thyroid cancer has a positive prognosis if the treatment is commenced at an early stage\n(95-98% of patients survive at least 5 years). While in most cases differentiated thyroid cancer is treatable,\nlocally advanced or metastatic cancer or cancer refractory to radioactive iodine (RAI) is more resistant and is associated with shorter patient survival, of up to 2.5–3.5 years. About 5-15% of patients become refractory\nto RAI therapy, 66% survive 5 years and 10% survive approx. 10 years. The prognosis for differentiated thyroid\ncancers (DTCs) is better in younger patients. The growth of differentiated cancers is slow, which can lead to a false belief that the nodule is benign. Approximately 5% of patients are diagnosed at a late stage, in the generalised dissemination phase, when the prognosis is worse and despite treatment, only approx. 50% of patients survive 10 years. The formation of\nnon-iodine avid distant metastases is particularly unfavourable. Based on the identified guidelines and the opinions of clinical experts, best supportive care was selected as the alternative therapy to sorafenib. In line with the opinion of the expert cited by the applicant, currently the analysed patient population is treated with BSC, which includes thyroid hormone therapy, bisphosphonates, analgesics and corticosteroids,\nas well as palliative radiotherapy.",

The proposed payment and reimbursement availability category: a free-of-charge drug available as part of a\ndrug programme, within the 1078.0 Sorafenib joint-limit group. The applicant has proposed a risk-sharing\nscheme. Thyroid cancer is a malignant tumour originating:\n• from thyroid follicular cells:\no differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC),\n▪ papillary thyroid cancers (PTC),\n▪ follicular thyroid cancers (FTC),\n▪ Hürthle cell carcinoma (HCC), o undifferentiated cancer (anaplastic – 2-5%),\n• from calcitonin-producing C-cells (peridicular),\no medullary cancer (5%). The clinical presentation of thyroid cancer is unspecific. A developing nodule does not differ from benign\nnodules, therefore early diagnosis is only possible through fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Lymph node\nmetastases are more common in Hürthle cell tumours compared to FTC. In some cases, the first noticeable symptom of the disease are cervical lymph nodes enlarged due to metastases. In about 5% of cases, distant metastases have already occurred, and they can be the first\nsymptoms leading to the diagnosis. Rapid growth of the nodule, its impermeability on the skin or hoarseness (a sign of infiltration of the laryngeal nerve) occurs at an advanced stage. Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant tumour of the endocrine glands. Its incidence is about 7.4 in\nwomen and 1.7/100,000/year in men. The onset of the disease may occur at any age, peaking between 40\nand 50 years of age. The number of thyroid cancer cases according to the KRN [National Cancer Registry] data\nfor 2015 was 3,529 patients, of which about 605 were men and 2,924 were women. Over the past two\ndecades, the number of cases has increased significantly.",

The costs of the therapy are estimated in the Polish currency and the health effects are usually expressed using the life years gained (LYG) or the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) as a result of the therapy. The comparison of values concerning the costs and effects related to the use of a new therapy and comparing them to the costs and effects of currently reimbursed therapies allow for obtaining an answer to the question\non whether the health effect achieved as a result of the new therapy is associated with higher costs in comparison to the currently reimbursed therapies. The achieved cost-effectiveness ratios are compared with the so-called cost-effectiveness threshold, i.e. which\nindicates that taking into account the means at the disposal of Poland (expressed in its GDP), the maximum cost of a new therapy necessary to obtain a unit of health effect (1 LYG or 1 QALY), compared to the currently\navailable treatments, should not exceed three times the amount of per capita GDP. Currently the cost-effectiveness threshold in Poland amounts to PLN 147,024 (3 x PLN 49,008). The cost-effectiveness ratio does not estimate or determine the value of life, it only allows to assess and, among other things, select a therapy associated with the potentially best use of the currently available\nresources. As part of the economic analysis, the applicant conducted an economic analysis in the form of a cost-utility analysis (CUA) from the public payer's perspective (the National Health Fund) and from the common\nperspective (the NHF and the patient), which is comparable to the payer’s perspective in terms of the conditions for reimbursement proposed in the application (i.e. drug programme).",

Firstly, the analysis of the impact on the payer's budget allows for estimating potential expenditure related to the financing of a new therapy from public funds. The estimated expenditure related to the new therapy (the “tomorrow” scenario) is compared with how much currently is spent on the treatment of a particular health problem (the “today” scenario). On that basis it is\npossible to assess whether the new therapy will require a higher level of funding for the treatment of a particular health problem or whether it will involve savings in the payer’s budget. The budget impact assessment makes it possible to determine whether the payer possesses the necessary resources to finance a particular technology. The second part of the analysis of the effects on the healthcare system raises the question on how the decision to finance a new therapy can affect the organisation of the provision of services (especially in the context of\nadjustments necessary for the new therapy to be used) and the availability of other healthcare services. As part of the budget impact analysis, the applicant has provided the estimates of the expected expenditure on the public payer's part in the case of adopting a positive decision on financing Nexavar (sorafenib) from\npublic funds used for the treatment of advanced, differentiated thyroid cancer, refractory to radioactive iodine.

It is the 6th most common worldwide, being responsible for a large number of deaths. HCCs occur in 90% of situations in a cirrhosis context, with the main risk factors in the Western world being hepatitis C virus infection and alcoholism. In the Eastern world there is a high prevalence of hepatitis B (which has been shown to have a direct oncogenic effect). In Portugal, for 2015 and based on the ROR-Sul data, it is estimated that about 360 new cases have been diagnosed nationally. The standardized rate for age (European standard population) is 4.26/100,000 and 0.26/100.000 respectively for men and women. Based on this Portuguese population of 10 million inhabitants, the number of new cases will be approximately 452 patients. Considering that 32% of these patients will have advanced CHC 145 and 57% of them will not initiate treatment, lenvatinib will be studied for 62.

The Committee emphasises that the number of events in this outcome was sufficient to draw conclusions from the study. The REFLECT study demonstrated superiority of lenvatinib compared to sorafenib in the outcomes of progression-free survival (median 7.4 versus 3.7 months, respectively, with a HR of 0.66 and a 95% CI of 0.57 to 0.77, p< 0.001) and response rate (24.1% versus 9.2%), OR 3.13 (95% CI 2.15 to 4.56, p < 0.001), however these results are not critical for this evaluation. There were no significant differences in most quality of life parameters. There was no significant increase in adverse events with Lenvatinib as compared to Sorafenib.

There is no significant difference in most of the domains assessed by the QLQ-C30 questionnaire.There is no evidence of added therapeutic value of lenvatinib in the outcome life. The rate of adverse events was 18.9 patient-years in the lenvatinib group and 19.7 events per patient-year in the sorafenib group.Therefore, there is no evidence of additional harm from Lenvatinib in the outcome number of events the rate of Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions Adverse events resulting from treatment of grade 3 or higher occurred with no rates with lenvatinig and sorafenig (75.0% versus 66.5%). In the sorafenib arm, fatal adverse events occurred in four (1%) and included tumour haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke, respiratory failure and sudden death (one for each). Thus, there is no evidence of additional harm from lenvatinib in the treatment-related mortality outcome. The evidence submitted was rated as being of moderate quality for all outcomes, given that there are some significant differences between some baseline characteristics with potential prognostic impact and the fact that it is an open label study.",

The health economics analysis that the company chose to do for STRIDE versus atezozizumab + bevazizumab is a cost comparison. A prerequisite for a cost-comparison to constitute a TLV health economic assessment is that it is reasonable to assume comparable efficacy for the treatment options. TLV assessment: Based on the company' s MAIC, TLV assesses that treatment with STRIDA is comparable to atezoizumab Plus bevavizumab for the overall survival effect measure. For PFS, the company ' s indirect comparisons suggest better outcomes for atezoazumab+ bevaxizumab. However, based on its cost-to-life comparison and the prevailing indirect uncertainty in the company comparison between STRIDEs and atezozumab, the TLV also assumes comparable effectiveness between TLVs for the PFS effect. Efficacy and safety of lenvatinib compared to sorafenib have been studied in the Phase III non-inferiority study REFLECT [10], which showed comparable efficacy between the alternatives for efficacy measures OS. The company has indirectly compared STRIDE with lenvatitinib with an anchored MAIC based on the HIMALAYA and REFLECT studies, both of which had Sorafenib as a comparator. For PFS, there were differences in its definition in HIMALAYA and REFLECT. The hazard ratio for PFS for STRIDE compared to sorafenib after adjustments for the HIMALYA population was [--]. This is to be compared with the hazard rate for lenvatinib compared to Sorafenib in REFLEECT which was 0.65 (95% CI 0.560.77). Based on this, the risk ratio was calculated as follows:",

More than two-thirds of HCC occurs in cirrhotic livers, but HCC can also occur in livers without cirrhomosis, especially in non-alcoholic fatty liver, chronic hepatitis B and porphyria. Risk factors to HCC are mainly viruses (hepatitis B and C), liver toxicity (alcohol and aflatoxin), and metabolic diseases (diabetes mellitus, hepatic fatty hepatitis, hemochromatosis, which affects the liver). The survival rate of patients with hepatitis B or porphyry can be reduced by up to 3 months after treatment, depending on the medication used.[1] The median survival time for patients with liver palliative disease is 40 years, but the average survival is less than 3 years after treatment.[1] Imfinzi, a medicine containing the active substance durvalumab, received its first marketing authorisation in Europe on 21 September 2018 and the last indication was obtained on 14 April 2023. Imjudo, a medicinal product containing the Active Substance tremelimumab received its marketing authorisations in Europe as of 20 February 2023. Imjudo in combination with Imfinzi is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced or non-resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Tremelimumab and durvalumab are checkpoint inhibitors that enhance the anti-tumour response of the immune system. Tremelemumab exerts its function early in the immune response while durvelumab is expected to exert its effect later in the immunological response.[2] Tremelamumab, a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody, targets cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, CTLA-4, which is primarily expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes. Binding of CTLA-4 to the ligands CD80 and CD86 limits T cell activation. Imjudo is given as a single 300-milligram dose administered in combination with 1,500 milligrams of Imfinzi in Cycle 1 on Day 1, followed by Im finzi every four weeks as monotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [3].",

Regarding PFS, TLV considers that it is reasonable to assume that the efficacy of Lenvima is better than that of sorafenib. Therefore, in TLV's analysis, the PFS curve for Lenvema is extrapolated by applying a constant hazard quotient of 0,66 (from the RE-FLECT study [10]) to the extrapolled curve of sorabenib. Even with the aforementioned adjustments of OS and PFS for lenvima, the TLV assesses that there are uncertainties with the extrapolation as the data is based on the REFLECT TLV study. However, TL V considers the adjustments made make OS and pFS more consistent with the opinion of the FLECT study, the national healthcare and TLV programme experts on the effectiveness of LENVIMA in relation to the effect of soravenib. TLV' s assessment: TLV considers that the company' s modelling of OS and PFS is uncertain. TLV chooses to model OS for STRIDE and sorafenib with the Hazard 1 knot distribution and assumes that the efficacy benefit of STRIDES relative to OS decreases progressively between years 6 and 8. Because the HIMALAYA study only includes data for patients treated with STRIDE or sorafenib, the company has made assumptions about the quality of life of patients treated by Lenvima.

The treatment of advanced HCC is not differentiated by whether the disease has a viral or non-viral etiology. According to TLV's clinical expert today, etiology is not taken into account in the selection of the treatment regimen. The expert believes that at present there is no evidence that etiology has any relevance for the response to treatment. I published the study from IM150 in which atezozizumab+ bevaxizumab was compared to bevajizumab as a treatment for HCC and no difference in efficacy was observed in patients with atherosclerosis (≥ 95%) in the subgroup of 1,05 to 1,68 patients with HCC plus sorafenil (≥ KIHRK1,63) [5]. According to the TLV clinical expert, this subgroup analysis can only be hypothetical and should be studied further. This interpretation is in line with the interpretation of the authors of the publication [5]. Furthermore, the expert has stated that there is a great need for treatment alternatives regardless of the etiology. Based on this, TLV considers that for this health-economic assessment, a division of the population into respective non-viral etiologies is not sufficiently justified. STRIDE compared to sorafenib in the HIMALAYA study [6] Treatment with STRADE has been evaluated against sorafenb in the Phase 3 HIMALYA study with an estimated end date of August 2024 [7].",

In the health economics model, all patients start in the progression free state and may then remain in the same state or be moved to progression illness or death. Patients who are progression freer may receive treatment with STRIDE or any of the comparison alternatives or no drug therapy. Also, patients who have progressed may receive weekly drug therapy or non-drug therapy. For patients whose HCC has a non-viral etiology, the company reports an analysis comparing STRIDE with Tecentriq plus bevacizumab. The analysis is a cost-benefit analysis using the same type of model as compared to sorafenib and Lenvima respectively. Section 4.1.2 presents the result of the company' s comparison against Tecentrq plusbevacizumb for patients with HCC having a non viral etiology. TLV considers that it is reasonable to assume comparable efficacy between STRIDE and Tecentriq plus bevacizumab and therefore makes a cost comparison. In the company' s health economics model, the OS and PFS for STRIDE and sorafenib are based on the HIMALAYA study. e effectiveness of Lenvima is based on its MAIC (see section 2.4.3). as the time horizon of the model exceeds the time available for study data, the company has used extrapolation to estimate the effect over time. e majority of parametric distributions10 have been adjusted to the observed KM estimates.",

The TLV clinical expert considers that the study design, where a second course of STRIDE was possible for some patients, could be a treatment option for isolated patients in Sweden. In Sweden, patients are treated first-line with sorafenib or lenvatinib if atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is not appropriate. However, according to the TLV Clinical Expert, an equivalent efficacy of sorefenib/lenvatinib is expected irrespective of patients' suitability for atezoizumab + bevaziumab. EMA considers that the adverse reactions of STRIDE are significant, but that relatively few patients discontinue treatment and that most of the side effects are clinically manageable. EMA is of the opinion that the side effect profile of ST RIDE is not significantly worse than that of sorafenib.[2] TLV's clinical expert considers STRITE's side effects were expected and that they do not differ significantly from other studies with combined immunotherapy. Furthermore, the expert believes that the Grade 3 and 4 adverse effects were comparable in STRIDEs and sorabenibs, and that it was positive that STRIDA did not cause side effects.

Based on these investigations, the company assumes that the proportionate hazards assumption is not rejected for OS in HIMALAYA, OS in IMbrave150 and PFS in IM Brave150. For PPS in HIMALAYA the company considers that it is difficult to draw conclusive conclusions on the proportional risks assumption and therefore the results of the indirect comparison must be interpreted with caution.
