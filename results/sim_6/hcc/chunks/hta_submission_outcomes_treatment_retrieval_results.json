Despite worse survival rates\ncompared to PVB thrombosis, PVT in the MPV should not be considered an absolute contraindication to TACE. 5.

Fazit der Autoren: (…) For the comparison of RFA to PEI/PAI, our\nconclusions suggest that for these patients treatment with RFA confers a survival benefit at 3 years compared with PEI/PAI. In addition, TTP and\nlocal recurrence may be improved in patients treated with RFA compared with PEI/PAI. Patients treated with RFA also seem to have longer LOS\nafter treatment compared with those treated with PEI/PAI. Beyond this\nevidence on the comparative effectiveness of these procedures was insufficient. Subsequent comparisons had only one or no comparative\nstudies on a given treatment comparison. For these comparisons,\nevidence was insufficient for all outcomes; thus, there is no comparative\nevidence base to support decision making. In cases where comparative\nevidence existed, data were judged to be insufficient due to high risk of bias and/or imprecision of estimates. 1.

Furthermore, it must be noted that no usable data are available for the selection of specific AEs.

Furthermore, it must be noted that no usable data are available for the selection of specific AEs.

For these comparisons,\nevidence was insufficient for all outcomes; thus, there is no comparative\nevidence base to support decision making. In cases where comparative\nevidence existed, data were judged to be insufficient due to high risk of bias and/or imprecision of estimates. 1. Fragestellung\nThe efficacy of sorafenib in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular a- carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial.

The primary objective of the REFLECT study was to compare OS in patients treated with\nlenvatinib versus sorafenib as a first-line treatment for unresectable stage B or C (according to BCLC staging system) HCC and Child Pugh Class A liver disease. The secondary objectives of the study were:\n To compare Progression-free survival (PFS), Time-to progression and Objective response rate of subjects treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib using (mRECIST)\n To compare the impact of treatment on generic Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) of subjects treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HCC18 questionnaires\n To compare safety and tolerability of subjects treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib\n To characterize the PK of lenvatinib using the population approach\n To assess the PK/PD relationship between exposure and efficacy/safety. The exploratory objectives of the study were:\n To compare DCR of subjects treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib using mRECIST\n To compare the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of subjects treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib\n To compare the impact of treatment on generic HRQoL factors for subjects treated with lenvatinib versus sorafenib using the European Quality of Life questionnaire\n To explore blood and tumour biomarkers which may correlate with clinical outcomes-related endpoints.

The HR and the corresponding 2sided 95% CI were estimated using a Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group as a factor, and stratified by the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors. Superiority hypotheses were tested for OS using a stratified log-rank test with the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors. No multiplicity adjustments were needed for testing of the non-inferiority and superiority of OS due to the closed testing principle. Two interim analyses were performed. Since the study was not stopped at the first or second interim analysis, non-inferiority for OS was tested first at the final analysis with a non-inferiority margin of 1.08, which indicated that lenvatinib preserved at least 60% (corresponding to δ = 0.60) of the sorafenib treatment effect versus placebo as observed in the sorafenib SHARP and Asia-Pacific trials [5,6].

We would like to supplement our application with additional evidence from, and further\nclarification of, the REFLECT clinical trial results, that show the added clinical value of lenvatinib in the treatment of HCC. The systematic literature review (SLR) has been updated in accordance with guidelines to include all relevant analyses of efficacy and safety from the REFLECT clinical study. The updated protocol and results\nare provided as an appendix to this response and all full text references are included in a separate folder\n(References/SLR References). A statement of expert opinion from a clinical expert is also enclosed to provide additional evidence. The Medicines Council used the Cochrane GRADE approach to evaluate evidence quality from the\nREFLECT study. According to the Medicine Council’s assessment report, the open-label nature of REFLECT\nimpacted the level of evidence quality with respect to:\n- Blinding of subjects (performance bias) - adverse events and health-related quality of life (HRQoL)\n- Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) - adverse events and HRQoL\nAn open-label design was necessary in the interests of patient safety because dose modification guidelines due to toxicity were different for lenvatinib and sorafenib for the same toxicities. In addition, the differences in\nformulation between lenvatinib (capsule) and sorafenib (tablet) would have required preparation of multiple matching placebo capsules or tablets to permit dose reductions.",

It\nnoted the ERG's comment that the study was not suitable for decisionmaking. However, the committee could not exclude the possibility of\nresidual confounding and concluded that the data from Palmer were a less robust source of evidence than the GIDEON data, now matched to\nSHARP.

It noted that lenvatinib was predicted to have higher or lower life expectancy than sorafenib, depending on th choice of overall-survival function. The committee understood that this was an artefact of the company's modelling approach. The choice of survival function for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and sorafenib was informed directly by IMbrave150 data. Survival for lenvatinib was informed by applying a hazard ratio from the NMA to the function for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. The committee agreed that it would have been preferable to apply the hazard ratio from the NMA for lenvatinib compared with sorafenib to the sorafenib survival function, because the drugs have a similar mechanism of action. However, it wou not expect this to have much effect on cost effectiveness. The committee concluded that it would consider cost-effectiveness results using the log-normal function to model survival, because this was the best-fitting function.

This is because the trial was likely to achieve better outcomes than in NHS practice. It advised that the log-normal function was the best-fitting model, although the loglogistic and generalised gamma functions also fitted the data well. It explained that there was no strong clinical rationale to favour any of these 3 functions over the other. Therefore, its preferred choice would be the best-fitting log-normal function.

The estimated clinical benefit would be 5, considering the HR 0.58 and a difference of 9.6 months in SG from the extrapolation of the KM curves (22). The recently published updated analysis of an additional 12 months of follow-up shows somewhat reduced outcomes (HR 0.66 and difference from medians of 5.9 months), but with that benefit the assessment would be maintained (21). DISCUSSION HCC is one of the most impactful neoplasms in terms of morbimortality despite the availability of a screening targeted at risk population and a well-established diagnostic algorithm (23). See Annex, Figure 2. To date, no biomarkers have been identified that serve as predictors of response to one treatment or another, or that are able to predict longer or shorter survival of patients (24). In recent years there have been advances from the therapeutic point of view with several drug positions in the treatment algorithm. In 2008, in the SHARP study, sorafenib achieved a median SG of 10.7 vs. 7.9 months in placebo-treated patients, with a HR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.55-0.87, p < 0.001) (12). In 2009, the Asia-Pacific study (NCT00492752) was published where the SG with soraphenib was 6.5 months vs. 4.2 with placebo with HR 95% of 0.68 (IC 0.5-0.93, p 0.014) - Lenvatinib (Lenvima®): In 2018, in the REFLECT study, lenvatinib achieved an SG of 13.6 vs. 12.3 months with sorafenub.",

The combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab is an option that adds therapeutic value to the treatment of patients with advanced and/ or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received prior systemic therapy with superior efficacy and a safety profile distinct from sorafenib in line with the known profile for atezoizumab or bevazib alone and may present more adverse events.

According to the latest available data, globally, HCC ranks seventh in incidence and fourth in direct mortality from cancer (1). The incidence of HCC increases with age (exceptionally it occurs before 40 years and the median age at diagnosis in our midst is between 65-70 years), being more frequent in men than in women (2). The rate of incidence is higher in western and south-eastern Africa, where the main etiological factors are hepatitis B and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection.",

Regarding first-line treatments, for several years sorafenib was the only systemic treatment available for HCC. While the safety profile of sorafenub was acceptable in the context of this disease, the overall prognosis of HCC with this treatment continued to be unsatisfactory. This led to numerous trials to try to obtain new alternatives. In 2018, the REFLECT trial demonstrated non-inferiority of lenvatinib with respect to lenfenib (25). All patients had locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic CHC, for which they had not received prior systemic therapy.

It should be noted that IMbrave150 is the first CHC trial in which a therapeutic option is statistically significantly superior to another treatment compared, rather than to placebo.

The rates of Grade > 3 adverse events (75.0% vs. 66.5%), GGEIs (43.1% vs. 30.3%) and MIEs leading to discontinuation of treatment (19.7% vs. 14.5%) appear to be higher with lenvatinib than with sorafenib. The GGE reported more frequently in the Lenvatinib group compared to the Sorafenib group were hepatic encephalopathy (4.4% vs. 0.6%), hepatic insufficiency (2.9% vs. 1.7%), and decreased appetite (2.3% versus 0.4%). Arterial thromboembolic events, haemorrhagic events, hypothyroidism and renal events were also observed with a higher incidence in the lenvatinib group compared to the sorafenib group.  Overall, the RECTEFL-304 study demonstrated non-inferiority in terms of overall survival (main judgement criterion) compared to Lenvatinib, with no evidence of systemic hemocytopenia, hepatocellular carcinoma (HEC) in patients with advanced or non-treatment-resistant CHD, and generally no pre-existing systemic HEC in patients receiving treatment. However, the Commission points out that the scope of the results is severely limited by: - The conduct of the open-label study when a double-blind study was possible, possibly inducing a measurement bias with respect to overall survival and the secondary hierarchical criteria of response to treatment; - The absence of robust quality of life data due to the open nature of the study and the lack of a pre-defined endpoint; - the partial crossover i.",

MEDICAL NEEDS Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common of the liver cancers (approximately 90%) 1 with an estimated incidence in France of approximately 9,600 new cases per year in 2018 2. This type of liver cancer develops most often on a renal cirrhosis (80% to 90% of cases) of various types (primary hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, diabetes mellitus). The prognosis of primary liver cancer remains one of the worst of all cancers with a 5-year survival rate of less than 15%.3 The management of HCC depends on the stage of the disease and the general condition of the patients4,5,6,7. Unlike other solid tumors, for which the therapeutic decision is made based on the TNM classification, there is no consensus prognostic classification for HCC7. Therefore, several classifications or scores have been proposed including the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 8 classification which has the advantage of enabling a prognosis stratification and proposing a treatment algorithm. When HCC is at an early stage (BC 0-A), patients are generally eligible for curative treatment by surgery, radiosurgery or transplantation. In case of failure, refractory disease or ineligibility for TACE, or in the presence of vascular invasion and/ or extrahepatic injury (advanced stage CLC), treatment with sorafenib is recommended in patients with preserved general condition (ECOG ≤ 2) and preserved hepatic function (Child-Pugh A). In adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (stage BCLC B or C) who have not received prior systemic therapy, the medical need is therefore considered to be partially met by sorafenib. However, there remains a medical need for better tolerated and/ or more effective treatments at this stage of the disease.",

As these may mainly involve fatigue, bleeding and abdominal pain, most of the patients studied had a Child-Pugh stage liver failure, there are limited data on safety and tolerability in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Experience According to the Periodic Safety Update Report for the first half of 2007, 19,086 patients were treated during that period (8740 commercially and 10,346 in clinical trials). 1The term \" adverse reactions\" refers to complaints and symptoms regardless of cause. Clinical pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely with concomitant use of agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 (midazolam, dextromethorphan, omeprazole). It cannot be excluded that sorafenib increases the concentrations of co-administered P-gp substrates (such as digoxin), CYP2B6 (like bupropion, cyclophosphamide, efavirenz, metronidazole), CYP8C2 (like paclitaxel, amodiaquine, repaglinide), or CYP2C9 (like acetoacetylsalicylate). Conclusion: There is an interaction between the concomitant use of sorafenib and inducers of CYP3A4 activity. There are no data on the efficacy and adverse effects of Sorafenib in children and adolescents. 4.f. Ease of use The recommended dose of soferanib is 400 mg (2 tablets of 200 mg) 2 times a day.

For these patients, no other pharmaceutical treatment costs are available, so that the full cost of using sorabenib is no longer borne by the CHF. The recommended dose of sorafenib is 400 mg twice a day. Treatment should be continued for as long as the patient has medical benefit or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. The manufacturer estimates that the average duration of treatment is 5 months (155 days), based on the average length of treatment in studies with the use of the average dose of Sorafenib in place of 710 mg per day, which was also recorded in two clinical trials, where the cost of the dose was 800 mg. The average cost of treatment with sorafenib is € 135.43 per day (i. e. 1 prescription per month, including VAT, delivery charge and clawback) at a dose of 800 mg per day.",

Cheung (020) 797 88 10 Subject Assessment of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma Dear Mr Klink, In your letter of 6 December 2007, you requested the Health Insurance Council (HIC) to assess whether Nexavar® (sorafenib) is interchangeable with a medicine included in the insured package. If not, you are requested to assess the therapeutic value of this medicine for the indication for which reimbursement has been requested. This medicine is included in Annex 1B of the health insurance regulation and is currently being assessed for the treatment of a new cancer, i. e. This review concerns a new indication, namely the use of sorafenib in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer). You have granted the manufacturer of the medicine Nexavar® an exemption for a pharmaco-economic study. The Pharmaceutical Aid Committee (CFH) of the CVZ has now completed the substantive review. The considerations herein are contained in the CFH Report 08/03 attached as an annex. On the basis of this opinion of CFH and administrative considerations, the CDC has adopted its opinion on Nexavir® (sorafenib) in hepatocell carcinomas. CVZ Opinion The CVZ recommends that you extend the detailed conditions for Nexaver® to Annex 2 of the Health Insurance Regulations. This extension covers a subgroup of patients with hepatotoxicity to sorafenil per year, 164 patients were enrolled in the Netherlands in 1989-2000 (more than one patient per year). Background In the Netherlands, during the period 1989-2000, 1964 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled (an average of 164 patients per year). The 5-year survival rate was 7% and the 1-year survivorship rate was 22%.",

Hepatocellular carcinoma is newly diagnosed in an estimated 560,000 people per year, worldwide.1 In the Netherlands, a total of 1964 patients with hepatocellulose cancer were registered in the period 1989-2000 (1964/12 = 164/year).2 The male-female ratio was 2.4:1. In 2000, the standardized incidence was 1.6/100,000 men and 0.3/100,000 women. There was no increase over time. Risk factors in Europe are: hepatitis C (60-70%), alcohol consumption (20%), hepatitis B (10-15%) and other (10%). In a European study covering 1990-1994, the 5-year survival rate for the Netherlands was 7% and the 1-year survivorship rate was 22%.2 Stage classification.

The authors of Brose 2016 also indicated that the separation of Kaplan-Meier curves was maintained in time in favour of sorafenib (however, the graphs were not presented in the abstract).

The median overall survival in the DECISION study was not\nachieved and no differences between sorafenib and BSC in terms of this endpoint were found. The applicant's\nbasic analysis is based on results adjusted for cross-over (which occurred in 75% of patients in the BSC arm) obtained as part of post-hoc secondary survival analyses.

Assuming that the applicant's\nmodel lacks differences in overall survival between the two compared arms, the intervention in question becomes a technology dominated [information protected as a trade secret].

The costs of the therapy are estimated in the Polish currency and the health effects are usually expressed using the life years gained (LYG) or the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) as a result of the therapy. The comparison of values concerning the costs and effects related to the use of a new therapy and comparing them to the costs and effects of currently reimbursed therapies allow for obtaining an answer to the question\non whether the health effect achieved as a result of the new therapy is associated with higher costs in comparison to the currently reimbursed therapies. The achieved cost-effectiveness ratios are compared with the so-called cost-effectiveness threshold, i.e. which\nindicates that taking into account the means at the disposal of Poland (expressed in its GDP), the maximum cost of a new therapy necessary to obtain a unit of health effect (1 LYG or 1 QALY), compared to the currently\navailable treatments, should not exceed three times the amount of per capita GDP. Currently the cost-effectiveness threshold in Poland amounts to PLN 147,024 (3 x PLN 49,008). The cost-effectiveness ratio does not estimate or determine the value of life, it only allows to assess and, among other things, select a therapy associated with the potentially best use of the currently available\nresources. As part of the economic analysis, the applicant conducted an economic analysis in the form of a cost-utility analysis (CUA) from the public payer's perspective (the National Health Fund) and from the common\nperspective (the NHF and the patient), which is comparable to the payer’s perspective in terms of the conditions for reimbursement proposed in the application (i.e. drug programme).",

The statistical endpoint on overall survival was tested for first-inferiority and non-infectiousness by using sorbamazepine, after assuming a placebo-containing lower-than-normal dose of 1,08 mg/day, with no correlation to the placebo effect. The power of the study to demonstrate non-inferiority was approximately 97%; the power of this study to declare superiority of lenvatinib over sorafenib was approximately 82%. The overall false positive rate was set at 0.05. The number of events required for the primary analysis was 700 deaths, assuming 5% dropouts. Secondary outcomes were also analysed with a 95% confidence interval.",

Evaluation and comments on the evidence submitted **Source Type:** hta_submission\n\nThe evidence submitted by the company refers to the REFLECT study, which is an open-label, randomised, multinational, multi-centre, non-inferiority comparative trial that compared lenvatinib to sorafenib in the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable HCC. The Committee emphasises that the number of events in this outcome was sufficient to draw conclusions from the study. The REFLECT study demonstrated superiority of lenvatinib compared to sorafenib in the outcomes of progression-free survival (median 7.4 versus 3.7 months, respectively, with a HR of 0.66 and a 95% CI of 0.57 to 0.77, p< 0.001) and response rate (24.1% versus 9.2%), OR 3.13 (95% CI 2.15 to 4.56, p < 0.001), however these results are not critical for this evaluation. There were no significant differences in most quality of life parameters. There was no significant increase in adverse events with Lenvatinib as compared to Sorafenib. This conclusion is based on the following:  REFLECT study which is an open-label, randomised, multinational, multi-centre, phase 3 non-inferiority comparative trial comparing lenvatinib to sorafenib in the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable HCC.  In the REFLECT study lenvitinib demonstrated no inferiority and did not demonstrate superiority compared to Sorafenib for the overall survival outcome, the critical outcome of this study. There was no demonstration of superiority in the quality of life outcome.  No significant comparative safety concerns were identified for lenvatinib. This conclusion is based on the following:  REFLECT Study which is an open-label, randomised, multinational, multi-centre, non-inferiority comparative trial that compared lenvatinib to sorafenib in the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable ORCC.  In the REFLET study, Lenvatinib demonstrated no inferiority and no superiority in comparison to Sorafenib for the monotherapy treatment of adult patients with advanced or unresettable CHC.",

It is the 6th most common worldwide, being responsible for a large number of deaths. HCCs occur in 90% of situations in a cirrhosis context, with the main risk factors in the Western world being hepatitis C virus infection and alcoholism. In the Eastern world there is a high prevalence of hepatitis B (which has been shown to have a direct oncogenic effect). In Portugal, for 2015 and based on the ROR-Sul data, it is estimated that about 360 new cases have been diagnosed nationally. The standardized rate for age (European standard population) is 4.26/100,000 and 0.26/100.000 respectively for men and women. Based on this Portuguese population of 10 million inhabitants, the number of new cases will be approximately 452 patients.

Compared to the August 2021 data collection, in the January 2023 data collection the median value of the STRIDE and sorafenib OS was essentially unchanged, as well as the odds ratio and its confidence interval. Figure 3: Kaplan Meier curve for the Olympics, data extracted January 2023 [8] Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 13.7% of patients in the STRIDE arm and 16.8% in the sorafenib arm.",

The health economics analysis that the company chose to do for STRIDE versus atezozizumab + bevazizumab is a cost comparison. A prerequisite for a cost-comparison to constitute a TLV health economic assessment is that it is reasonable to assume comparable efficacy for the treatment options. TLV assessment: Based on the company' s MAIC, TLV assesses that treatment with STRIDA is comparable to atezoizumab Plus bevavizumab for the overall survival effect measure. For PFS, the company ' s indirect comparisons suggest better outcomes for atezoazumab+ bevaxizumab. However, based on its cost-to-life comparison and the prevailing indirect uncertainty in the company comparison between STRIDEs and atezozumab, the TLV also assumes comparable effectiveness between TLVs for the PFS effect. Efficacy and safety of lenvatinib compared to sorafenib have been studied in the Phase III non-inferiority study REFLECT [10], which showed comparable efficacy between the alternatives for efficacy measures OS. The company has indirectly compared STRIDE with lenvatitinib with an anchored MAIC based on the HIMALAYA and REFLECT studies, both of which had Sorafenib as a comparator. For PFS, there were differences in its definition in HIMALAYA and REFLECT. The hazard ratio for PFS for STRIDE compared to sorafenib after adjustments for the HIMALYA population was [--]. This is to be compared with the hazard rate for lenvatinib compared to Sorafenib in REFLEECT which was 0.65 (95% CI 0.560.77). Based on this, the risk ratio was calculated as follows:",

The TLV clinical expert considers that the study design, where a second course of STRIDE was possible for some patients, could be a treatment option for isolated patients in Sweden. In Sweden, patients are treated first-line with sorafenib or lenvatinib if atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is not appropriate. However, according to the TLV Clinical Expert, an equivalent efficacy of sorefenib/lenvatinib is expected irrespective of patients' suitability for atezoizumab + bevaziumab. EMA considers that the adverse reactions of STRIDE are significant, but that relatively few patients discontinue treatment and that most of the side effects are clinically manageable. EMA is of the opinion that the side effect profile of ST RIDE is not significantly worse than that of sorafenib.[2] TLV's clinical expert considers STRITE's side effects were expected and that they do not differ significantly from other studies with combined immunotherapy. Furthermore, the expert believes that the Grade 3 and 4 adverse effects were comparable in STRIDEs and sorabenibs, and that it was positive that STRIDA did not cause side effects.

Risk factors to HCC are mainly viruses (hepatitis B and C), liver toxicity (alcohol and aflatoxin), and metabolic diseases (diabetes mellitus, hepatic fatty hepatitis, hemochromatosis, which affects the liver). The survival rate of patients with hepatitis B or porphyry can be reduced by up to 3 months after treatment, depending on the medication used.[1] The median survival time for patients with liver palliative disease is 40 years, but the average survival is less than 3 years after treatment.[1] Imfinzi, a medicine containing the active substance durvalumab, received its first marketing authorisation in Europe on 21 September 2018 and the last indication was obtained on 14 April 2023. Imjudo, a medicinal product containing the Active Substance tremelimumab received its marketing authorisations in Europe as of 20 February 2023. Imjudo in combination with Imfinzi is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced or non-resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Tremelimumab and durvalumab are checkpoint inhibitors that enhance the anti-tumour response of the immune system. Tremelemumab exerts its function early in the immune response while durvelumab is expected to exert its effect later in the immunological response.[2] Tremelamumab, a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody, targets cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, CTLA-4, which is primarily expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes. Binding of CTLA-4 to the ligands CD80 and CD86 limits T cell activation. Imjudo is given as a single 300-milligram dose administered in combination with 1,500 milligrams of Imfinzi in Cycle 1 on Day 1, followed by Im finzi every four weeks as monotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [3].",

The EMA considers that the patient-reported outcome data are not clinically relevant, due in part to the open design of the study [2]. The TLV also notes that the quality-of-life weights for all conditions in both treatment arms are higher than the quality Of-life in the normal population for the corresponding age and gender distribution11. At the request of the TLV, the company has reported quality-Of-Life weights based on data converted to EQ-5D-3L and with the tariff of Dolan [13]. The TL V has considered using the quality -of-Life weight from the NICE evaluation of Lenimav [14]. The quality- Of-Life Weight in NICE's evaluation is 0.745 in progression-free condition and 0.678 in the progressive condition. The Quality of Life Weights from the CLIL study are difficult to reasonably use, but appear to be more useful than those from NICE. the study appears to be somewhat high, but whether the quality of life weights used by NICE are more reasonable to use is difficult to determine. TLV chooses to apply the HIMALAYA quality-of-life weights as they are obtained through the clinical study; TLV uses the EQ-5D-3L-converted weights in combination with the Dolan tariff; in addition, TLV applies state-specific quality- Of-Life weights. In TLV's analysis, the quality- of-life weightings are 0.814 in the progression-free state and 0.788 in the progressed state; in the sensitivity analysis TLV shows how the outcome is affected by the use of the same quality-Of-Life Weights as used in NICE's evaluation of Lenima. In addition to the above-mentioned differences between companies and the assumptions of TLV, the company has preferred to use the different scenarios of the treatment of the TLV.",

Regarding PFS, TLV considers that it is reasonable to assume that the efficacy of Lenvima is better than that of sorafenib. Therefore, in TLV's analysis, the PFS curve for Lenvema is extrapolated by applying a constant hazard quotient of 0,66 (from the RE-FLECT study [10]) to the extrapolled curve of sorabenib. Even with the aforementioned adjustments of OS and PFS for lenvima, the TLV assesses that there are uncertainties with the extrapolation as the data is based on the REFLECT TLV study. However, TL V considers the adjustments made make OS and pFS more consistent with the opinion of the FLECT study, the national healthcare and TLV programme experts on the effectiveness of LENVIMA in relation to the effect of soravenib. TLV' s assessment: TLV considers that the company' s modelling of OS and PFS is uncertain. TLV chooses to model OS for STRIDE and sorafenib with the Hazard 1 knot distribution and assumes that the efficacy benefit of STRIDES relative to OS decreases progressively between years 6 and 8. Because the HIMALAYA study only includes data for patients treated with STRIDE or sorafenib, the company has made assumptions about the quality of life of patients treated by Lenvima. The company assumes that the quality-of-life is the same for patients who are treated with lenvima as sorafenik. In the company's analysis, the quality is assumed to be the same at different levels of treatment. The quality is also assumed [-- depending on the patient's survival. Sorafenib and Lenvima",

In the analysis where Imfinzi plus Imjudo is compared with Lenvima, the extrapolation of OS, PFS and TTD as well as the selection of quality of life weights are associated with very high uncertainty.

The treatment of advanced HCC is not differentiated by whether the disease has a viral or non-viral etiology. According to TLV's clinical expert today, etiology is not taken into account in the selection of the treatment regimen. The expert believes that at present there is no evidence that etiology has any relevance for the response to treatment. I published the study from IM150 in which atezozizumab+ bevaxizumab was compared to bevajizumab as a treatment for HCC and no difference in efficacy was observed in patients with atherosclerosis (≥ 95%) in the subgroup of 1,05 to 1,68 patients with HCC plus sorafenil (≥ KIHRK1,63) [5]. According to the TLV clinical expert, this subgroup analysis can only be hypothetical and should be studied further. This interpretation is in line with the interpretation of the authors of the publication [5]. Furthermore, the expert has stated that there is a great need for treatment alternatives regardless of the etiology. Based on this, TLV considers that for this health-economic assessment, a division of the population into respective non-viral etiologies is not sufficiently justified. STRIDE compared to sorafenib in the HIMALAYA study [6] Treatment with STRADE has been evaluated against sorafenb in the Phase 3 HIMALYA study with an estimated end date of August 2024 [7].",
