Overall, HCC patients are categorized into those with early HCC who benefit from curative therapy, those with intermediate and advanced disease who have benefited from palliative treatments, and finally patients who have terminal disease who are offered symptomatic treatment.[3] Patients with early disease (BCLCC A) are evaluated for surgical removal of the tumor, liver transplantation or percutaneous ablation (destruction of cancer cells by means of subtle chemotherapy or hyper-hypothermia, where in particular radiofrequency (RFA) therapy has been introduced in Denmark) with the possibility of five-year recovery, and have a high incidence of hepatohepatitis over five years, and do not have symptoms and are still dependent on interstitial treatment.[3] About 50-75 percent of the patients with BCC who respond to this treatment have no symptoms or no symptoms are still undergoing treatment with liver cancer (BBCLC A, BCLC A) or in childhood cancer.[3]",

It noted from the clinical studies that life expectancy without sorafenib was unlikely to be greater than 24 months and was potentially as low as 7.9 months, although the latter was based on SHARP, which was stopped early. The committee considered that evidence from the clinical studies of sorafenib plus best supportive care suggested that it increased median survival by more than 2.8 months compared with placebo plus best supportive care, and the company's economic model predicted a mean gain in overall survival of 6.1 months, although this depended on the method of extrapolation.

Unlike other solid tumors, for which the therapeutic decision is made based on the TNM classification, there is no consensus prognostic classification for HCC7. Therefore, several classifications or scores have been proposed including the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 8 classification which has the advantage of enabling a prognosis stratification and proposing a treatment algorithm. When HCC is at an early stage (BC 0-A), patients are generally eligible for curative treatment by surgery, radiosurgery or transplantation. In case of failure, refractory disease or ineligibility for TACE, or in the presence of vascular invasion and/ or extrahepatic injury (advanced stage CLC), treatment with sorafenib is recommended in patients with preserved general condition (ECOG ≤ 2) and preserved hepatic function (Child-Pugh A). In adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (stage BCLC B or C) who have not received prior systemic therapy, the medical need is therefore considered to be partially met by sorafenib.

Clinical pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely with concomitant use of agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 (midazolam, dextromethorphan, omeprazole). It cannot be excluded that sorafenib increases the concentrations of co-administered P-gp substrates (such as digoxin), CYP2B6 (like bupropion, cyclophosphamide, efavirenz, metronidazole), CYP8C2 (like paclitaxel, amodiaquine, repaglinide), or CYP2C9 (like acetoacetylsalicylate).

In 2000, the standardized incidence was 1.6/100,000 men and 0.3/100,000 women. There was no increase over time. Risk factors in Europe are: hepatitis C (60-70%), alcohol consumption (20%), hepatitis B (10-15%) and other (10%). In a European study covering 1990-1994, the 5-year survival rate for the Netherlands was 7% and the 1-year survivorship rate was 22%.2 Stage classification.

TLV assumed that 40 percent of patients receive follow-up treatment. After treatment with Stride, half of the patients are assumed to receive soraphenib and half of those patients are considered to be receiving sorafenima. Patients treated with first-line Lenven or Lenven are equally divided between Stivarga (regorafenib) and Cabometyx (kabozantinib). TLV presents sensitivity analyses with other assumptions about follow-on treatments. The Company reports a cost comparison between STRIDE and Tecentriq plus bevacizumab. The Company' s cost comparisons include drug and drug administration costs. Based on the indirect comparison reported by the Company (see section 2.4.2), it is assumed that treatment with Tecentrq + bevazizumab would result in a longer progression-free survival compared to STRIDES.

The treatment of advanced HCC is not differentiated by whether the disease has a viral or non-viral etiology. According to TLV's clinical expert today, etiology is not taken into account in the selection of the treatment regimen. The expert believes that at present there is no evidence that etiology has any relevance for the response to treatment. I published the study from IM150 in which atezozizumab+ bevaxizumab was compared to bevajizumab as a treatment for HCC and no difference in efficacy was observed in patients with atherosclerosis (≥ 95%) in the subgroup of 1,05 to 1,68 patients with HCC plus sorafenil (≥ KIHRK1,63) [5]. According to the TLV clinical expert, this subgroup analysis can only be hypothetical and should be studied further.",

The TLV clinical expert considers that the study design, where a second course of STRIDE was possible for some patients, could be a treatment option for isolated patients in Sweden. In Sweden, patients are treated first-line with sorafenib or lenvatinib if atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is not appropriate. However, according to the TLV Clinical Expert, an equivalent efficacy of sorefenib/lenvatinib is expected irrespective of patients' suitability for atezoizumab + bevaziumab. EMA considers that the adverse reactions of STRIDE are significant, but that relatively few patients discontinue treatment and that most of the side effects are clinically manageable. EMA is of the opinion that the side effect profile of ST RIDE is not significantly worse than that of sorafenib.[2] TLV's clinical expert considers STRITE's side effects were expected and that they do not differ significantly from other studies with combined immunotherapy. Furthermore, the expert believes that the Grade 3 and 4 adverse effects were comparable in STRIDEs and sorabenibs, and that it was positive that STRIDA did not cause side effects.",
