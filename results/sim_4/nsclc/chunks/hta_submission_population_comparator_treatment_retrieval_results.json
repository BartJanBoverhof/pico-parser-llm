Accordingly, the guidelines regularly prefer immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. However, PD-L1 negative tumours are a fundamental exception. In these cases, the guidelines predominantly do not recommend a regular preference of immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapy.

There are several approved treatments targeting specific driver mutations in NSCLC that have improved patient survival significantly compared with non-targeted treatments for patients with an actionable mutation(1). However, currently, no approved treatment is available that specifically targets the KRAS G12C driver mutation in NSCLC. Standard of care treatment for KRAS G12C mutated NSCLC is currently the same as for patients with nontargetable mutations. This includes PD-(L)1 inhibitors (with or without platinum chemotherapy) for first-line (1L)\ntreatment of advanced NSCLC.",

A propensity score weighted analysis approach such as MAIC requires the matching of prognostic patient characteristics to generate robust comparative treatment effect estimates.

Based on a register study in the capital region, the KRAS G12C mutation occurred in X of non-squamous NSCLC patients (Data on file(5)). This equates to 292 KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC cases in Denmark in 2020. The\nestimated incidence of the KRAS G12C mutation is similar to the incidence suggested by two Danish clinical experts within NSCLC(2, 3). The two clinical experts suggested an annual incidence of 250-300 KRAS G12C\nmutations eligible for 1L treatment. Based on clinical validation, approximately 50% of the patients reach 2L\ntreatment each year. This equates to approximately 140 potential incident patients per year in Denmark. Furthermore, it was reported in the DLCR report that up to 26% of patients that started 1L treatment in 2020 was treated with curatively intended treatment this reduces the estimate to approximately 110 patients per\nyear in Denmark (4). To accommodate annual variation and uncertainty around the estimate, a range of 110-\n140 eligible patients is assumed for 2L treatment with sotorasib in Denmark every year (see Table 4).",

Several published observational studies in Western (European, Australian and US) populations show that survival in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC is similarly poor as that in patients with other KRAS mutations or\nwild type disease who are not eligible for existing targeted therapies (72, 128, 129).",

However, the KRAS G12C mutation rarely occurs at the\nsame time as these other actionable mutations, meaning that existing tumor-targeted therapies are not an option for patients with KRAS G12C mutation (58-61). Patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC are therefore\nmanaged in the same way as those without an actionable mutation. In line with the current treatment guidelines from the DLCG (6), clinical experts (2, 3) confirmed that an increasing majority of patients in Denmark with NSCLC without currently actionable mutations now receive anti-\nPD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy or as monotherapy in the firstline of therapy. Clinical experts confirmed that sotorasib would be used as an alternative to docetaxel monotherapy following recurring disease after frontline therapy with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy(2, 3).",

Sotorasib is a targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C mutation. Sotorasib has only been indirectly compared with current treatment. The results suggest\nthat, after platinum-based chemotherapy, sotorasib increases the time before the cancer gets worse and how long people live compared with current treatment. Sotorasib likely meets NICE's criteria to be a life-extending treatment at the end of life. But\nthere is uncertainty in the clinical evidence. Sotorasib has the potential to be cost\neffective, but more evidence is needed to address the uncertainties before it can be recommended for routine use. The evidence on sotorasib is promising. But, more data is being collected from the primary\nclinical trial and from an ongoing randomised controlled trial comparing sotorasib with docetaxel. Collecting additional data through the Cancer Drugs Fund may resolve some\nuncertainty in the clinical evidence. So, sotorasib is recommended for use in the Cancer\nDrugs Fund. © NICE 2024.

The median number of anterior lines received was 2 (min-max: 0-9). The other patients had 1 anterior line (43%), 2 anterior lines (31%), 3 anterior lines (16%) or 4 anterior lines and more (10%).",

Health system impact assessment, including the impact on the public payer's budget The Health System Impact Assessment consists of two important parts. Firstly, in the analysis of the effect on the payer' s budget, it allows to estimate the potential costs related to the financing of a new therapy from public funds. The estimates of the costs associated with the new therapy (tomorrow scenario) are comparable to what we currently spend on the treatment of a given health problem (today' s scenario). On this basis, it is possible to assess whether the new treatment will be able to cope with the increase in costs, or whether it will be necessary to allocate more funds to the treatment in the budget.

It is currently the only inhibitor of Kras G12c approved by the European Medicines Agency, at a dosage of 960 mg/day PO, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. As the biology of lung cancer has become known, new drugs have been developed that act on specific components of the cancer. These drugs are called biologic or targeted therapeutics. These mutations initiate the oncogenic process and activate signaling pathways that the tumour needs to survive. Blocking this signaling can induce apoptosis and tumour regression. This is the framework for the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced CPNPC with mutated KRAS G12C, oral therapeutics and with the possibility of sequential use after chemotherapy or immunotherapy. In case of progression, the second line of treatment for advanced cPNPC consists of docetaxel monotherapy, or with pemetrex or docetaxil + nitendanib combination, or PD-L1 inhibitors such as nivolumab, pembrozolizumab or pentotubes, followed by discontinuous tubulination of the tubule, which reduces the activity of docopib, and a decrease in its activity of an anti-tubulin agent, which is a reducing agent in the circulatory system.

To do this, data from the AACR GENIE registry, an international registry with information from 19 of the main cancer treatment centers in the world, is required.

Docetaxel or other chemotherapy is not always judged as medically appropriate. This may be, for example, in case of poor general condition, significant adverse reactions to previous chemotherapies, or insufficient or short-term disease control with previous therapy. There are no specific treatment recommendations for the more limited patient population. Once all treatment options have been exhausted, generally the best supportive treatment remains for these patients. The relative efficacy between Lumicras and docetaxel is considered to be overestimated and should be reviewed: the overall assessment of TLV based on clinical data is adjusted to reflect the overestimation of the clinical trial data and the analysis should be compared with the over-estimation from the previous health registry (docetaxel 141/ 202) which was assessed to have exceeded the survival rate. A direct comparative study between Lumykras and docetaxel has subsequently been published, in which the efficacy and safety of sotorasib compared to docetaxil in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced NSCLC following progression on prior platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy has been evaluated in an open-label, randomised Phase III study, CodeBreaK 200.",
