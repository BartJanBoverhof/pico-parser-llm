It should be noted that there is no higher quality\nevidence for the treatment of NSCLC related to the KRAS p.G12C mutation. So far, there\nare no other approved medicinal treatments besides sotorasib that are explicitly used\nin the presence of a KRAS p.G12C mutation according to the marketing authorisation.\nAccording to the scientific-medical societie s involved and the European Public\nAssessment Report (EPAR), the treatment standards correspond to those of metastatic\nnon- small cell lung cancer without specifically treatable oncogenic driver mutations.\nFor the present therapeutic indication, it is also assumed that the patients are generally\neligible for active antineoplastic therapy, which is why best supportive care is not\nconsidered as an appropriate comparator therapy in the present case.\nIn the second- line treatment, depending on the first - line therapy, a distinction is made\nbetween a) patients with an anti -PD-1/PD- L1 antibody monotherapy pretreatment, b)\npatients with cytotoxic chemotherapy pretreatment and c) after first - line therapy with\nan anti-PD-1/PD- L1 in combination with a platinum - containing chemotherapy or after\nsequential therapy with an anti -PD-1/PD- L1 and a platinum - containing chemotherapy\nas pretreatment.

For the combination\nof docetaxel and nintedanib, which is indicated for adenocarcinoma histology, an\nindication of a minor additional benefit was identified in the benefit assessment\ncompared to docetaxel monotherapy (resolution of 18 June 2015). In the guidelines,\ndocetaxel in combination with nintedanib is recommended alongside the other\nchemotherapy options, but is not regularly preferred over them. Based on the available\nevidence and corresponding therapy recommendations in the guidelines, docetaxel\nand pemetrexed, each as monotherapy, as well as docetaxel in combinati on with\nnintedanib, are considered therapeutically comparable, subject to tumour histology\nand the different side effect profile.\nFor nivolumab for the treatment of adults after prior chemotherapy and squamous\ntumour histology, an indication of a major add itional benefit was identified in the\nbenefit assessment compared to docetaxel (resolution of 4 February 2016).

Accordingly, the guidelines regularly prefer immune checkp oint inhibitors over\ncytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. However, PD - L1 negative tumours are a\nfundamental exception. In these cases, the guidelines predominantly do not\nrecommend a regular preference of immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic\nchemother apy. Therefore, in PD - L1 negative tumours, alternative cytotoxic\nchemotherapeutic agents are also determined as an appropriate comparator therapy\nfor the immune checkpoint inhibitors.\nFor ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel, no additional benefit was shown in\nthe benefit assessment compared to docetaxel (resolution of 1 September 2016).\nLikewise, no additional benefit was identified in the benefit assessment of afatinib\ncompared to docetaxel (resolution of 20 October 2016). Taking into account that\nbenefit-assessed medicinal treatments with an additional benefit are available in the\npresent indication, the treatment options ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel\nas well as afatinib, for which no additional benefit could be determined in each case,\nare not considered as an appropriate comparator therapy.\nIn the overall assessment, the G- BA determined docetaxel, pemetrexed, nivolumab,\npembrolizumab, atezolizumab and docetaxel in combination with nintedanib as equally\nappropriate comparator therapies for this patient group.

Therefore, an additional benefit is not proven.\nc) Adults with advanced non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS p.G12C mutation after\nfirst- line therapy with an anti -PD-1/PD- L1 in combination with platinum -containing\nchemotherapy or after sequential therapy with a n anti-PD-1/PD- L1 and platinum -\ncontaining chemotherapy\nc1) Adults for whom docetaxel is the appropriate patient - individual therapy\nHint of a non -quantifiable additional benefit.\nJustification:\nFor the proof of an additional benefit of sotorasib, the pharmaceutical company presents the\nstill ongoing randomised, open - label and multicentre phase III CodeBreak 200 study\ncomparing sotorasib versus docetaxel. The study has been conducted in 148 study sites in\nAsia, Australia, Europe and North and South America sinc e 2020.\nThe study enrolled adult patients with locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic NSCLC\nwith molecularly diagnosed KRAS G12C mutation. Patients had to have disease progression\nduring or after at least 1 prior systemic therapy for advanced or unresecta ble stage of the\ndisease. Prior therapy should include combined or sequential platinum -containing\ncombination chemotherapy and an anti -PD-1/PD- L1. A total of 334 (96.8%) patients in the\nstudy received prior treatment with PD -1/PD- L1 inhibitor and platinum -containing\nchemotherapy (in combination or sequentially). For enrolment in the study, patients should\nhave a general condition according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance\nStatus (ECOG - PS) ≤ 1, no relevant limitations in renal and liver func tion and no haematological\nlimitations.\nThe total of 345 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either treatment with sotorasib (N\n= 171) or docetaxel (N = 174), stratified by number of prior lines of therapy in advanced stage\nof the disease (1 vs 2 vs > 2), descent (Asian vs non-Asian) and brain metastases at the time of\nrandomisation (yes vs no).\nThe treatment with sotorasib or docetaxel complied with the specifications of the product\ninformation with restrictions regarding a renewed intake of sotora sib after vomiting or\n2 regarding a permitted dose reduction of docetaxel to 55 mg/m body surface area and, if\n2 required, a second dose reduction to 37.5 mg/m body surface area during the course of the\nstudy. Treatment with study medication continued until disease progression, intolerance of\ntreatment, initiation of new anti- cancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow - up or\ndeath. If certain criteria were met according to the principal investigator's assessment, further\ntreatment with sotorasib or d ocetaxel was possible even after disease progression. Under\ncertain conditions, e.g. the patients were not allowed to have started any other cancer\ntherapy, a change of therapy from docetaxel to sotorasib was possible at the doctor's\ndiscretion.\nThe primary endpoint of the study was progression -free survival according to a blinded,\nindependent central review. Other patient - relevant endpoints included overall survival and\nendpoints on symptomatology and health status. In addition, endpoints of the categories\nhealth- related quality of life and side effects were collected.\nThe pharmaceutical company presents results of the 1st data cut- off from 02.08.2022.\nImplementation of the appropriate comparator therapy\nThe CodeBreak 200 study presented is a single - comparator study in which all patients in the\ncomparator arm received docetaxel as monotherapy. Thus, the CodeBreak 200 study does\nnot implement the appropriate comparator therapy, which provides for a patient -individual\nselection from several named treatment options. In the submitted dossier and in the context\nof the statement, the pharmaceutical company justifies the choice of docetaxel with\nadvantages over the other options of the appropriate comparator therapy, in particular\ndocetaxel in combination with ramucirumab or docetaxel in combination with nintedanib, and\nadditionally cites the lack of global availability of individual therapy options.\nWithin the framework of the written statement procedure, the sc ientific-medical societies\ndescribe the therapy of pretreated NSCLC with docetaxel as a particularly relevant therapeutic\nalternative in view of the previous therapy for patients without contraindications. The other\ntherapy options included in the appropriate comparator therapy play a particularly relevant\ntherapeutic alternative. The other therapeutic alternative included in the appropriate\ncomparator therapy also play a role.\nEven taking into account the statements, the G - BA considers the CodeBreak 200 study as a\nwhole to be a sufficiently suitable evidence base to make an assessment with regard to the\nsub- population of patients for whom docetaxel is the appropriate patient - individual therapy.\nConsequently, a separate assessment is made for patients for w hom docetaxel is the\nappropriate patient - individual therapy (patient group c1)) and patients for whom a therapy\nother than docetaxel is the appropriate patient - individual therapy (patient group c2)).\nExtent and probability of the additional benefit\nc1) Adults for whom docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy\nHint for a non -quantifiable additional benefit\nMortality\nThe endpoint of overall survival was defined in the CodeBreak 200 study as the time from the\ndate of randomisation to death from any cause. There is no statistically significant difference\nbetween the treatment arms here.\nWith regard to overall survival, an additional benefit of sotorasib compared to docetaxel is\ntherefore not proven.\nMorbidity\nProgression-free survival (PFS)\nProgression- free survival (PFS) is defined in the study as the time from the date of\nrandomisation until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first.\nFor the PFS, there is a statistically significant difference to the advantage of sotor asib\ncompared to docetaxel.\nThe PFS endpoint is a combined endpoint composed of endpoints of the mortality and\nmorbidity categories. The endpoint component of mortality is already assessed via the\nendpoint of overall survival as an independent endpoint. The morbidity component is\nassessed according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1) and thus predominantly by means of\nimaging procedures. Taking into account the aspects mentioned above, there are different\nopinions within the G - BA regarding the patient -relevanc e of the endpoint PFS. The overall\nstatement on the extent of the additional benefit remains unaffected.\nProgression of central nervous system (CNS) metastases\nThe endpoint of progression in the CNS is defined in the CodeBreak 200 study as the time from\nrandomisation to radiological evidence of disease progression in the CNS (endpoint\nassessment only for patients who already had CNS disease at the time of enrolment in the\nstudy). The assessment is based solely on imaging procedures and does not take into account\nthe symptomatology perceived by patients. Thus, the endpoint is not directly patient -relevant\nand is not presented. In addition, only patients who already had CNS disease at the time of\nenrolment in the study were included in the analysis. Patients without previous CNS disease\nor with first-time occurrence of CNS metastases were not included in the evaluation.\nCross- endpoint assessment of patient - reported endpoints (PRO) data:\nWith regard to the endpoints assessed in the CodeBreak 200 study using the EORTC QLQ -C30,\nEORTC QLQ - LC13, BPI -SF, FACT-G GP5, and PGI- C questionnaires, IQWiG noted in the\naddendum to the dossier assessment that there was a differential percentage of patients\nincluded in the evaluation between the treatment arms for all corres ponding endpoints of >\n15 percentage points each, which is why IQWiG assessed the data as unsuitable overall. For\nthe present assessment, the results for the respective endpoints, in particular the effect\nestimator, the confidence interval and the percentage of patients included in the evaluation\nin the treatment arms, are also taken into account in order to assess the extent to which these\ndata are suitable or completely unsuitable for deriving statements on the additional benefit.\nSymptomatology\nIn the en dpoint category of morbidity, the CodeBreak 200 study recorded symptomatology\nusing the EORTC QLQ - C30 and LC - 13 questionnaires, the endpoints of worst pain and\nimpairment due to pain using BPI -SF items 3 and 9a- g, respectively, and the endpoint of\ntherapy burden using the single item GP5 from the FACT-G questionnaire.\nHealth status\nIn the CodeBreak 200 study, health status was assessed both with the PGI -C questionnaire\n(change in physical condition via the symptoms of cough, chest pain and shortness of breath)\n(VAS and via the EQ -5D visual analogue scale ). With regard to the evaluati ons of the VAS of\nthe EQ - 5D, a statistically significant difference to the advantage of sotorasib over docetaxel is\nshown for the endpoint of health status.\nSymptomatology\nAs a result of the above assessment of the data, the present assessment assumes an overall\npositive effect of sotorasib on symptomatology compared to docetaxel. This assessment is\nsupported by the consistent and, in some cases, very significant effects on several endpoints\non symptomatology as well as the statistically significant differ ence to the advantage of\nsotorasib in the endpoint of health status (EQ -5D VAS). Notwithstanding the fact that the\ndifferential percentage of > 15 percentage points per se results in a high risk of bias and a\nresulting large uncertainty, an overall advanta ge can thus be derived for sotorasib with regard\nto symptomatology.\nConclusion on morbidity endpoints:\nIn the overall analysis of the results, an advantage of sotorasib can be determined with regard\nto morbidity , the extent of which cannot be quantified.\nHealth - related quality of life\nThe health- related quality of life of the patients in the CodeBreak 200 study is assessed using\nthe functional scales of the EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaire. As a result of the above\nassessment of the data, the large uncertaint y predominates based on a weighing of the extent\nof the differential percentage of patients included in the treatment arms in the evaluation and\nthe magnitude of the effects on the quality of life endpoints. Therefore, an effect on the\noverall quality of life cannot be assumed with sufficient certainty. The result is that the data\nare not assessable.\nSide effects\nAdverse events (AEs) in total\nIn the CodeBreak 200 study, AEs occurred in both treatment arms in almost all study\nparticipants. The results were only presented additionally.\nSerious AEs (SAEs), severe AEs and discontinuation due to AEs\nThere is no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms for each of the\nendpoints of SAEs, severe AEs and discontinuation due to AEs.\nSpecific AEs\nInterstitial lung disease (severe AE)\nThere was no statistically significant differences between the treatment arms for the specific\nAE of interstitial lung disease.\nLiver disorders (severe AEs)\nFor the specific AE of liver disorders (severe AEs), there is a statistically significant difference\nto the disadvantage of sotorasib versus docetaxel.\nOther specific AEs\nFor the specific AEs of stomatitis (AE), peripheral oedema (AE), peripheral neuropathy (AE),\nalopecia (AE), blood and lymphatic system dis orders (AE), fatigue (AE), fever (AE) and\ninfections and infestations (AE), there was a statistically significant difference to the\nadvantage of sotorasib versus docetaxel.\nFor the specific AE of chest pain (AE) and diarrhoea (AE), there was a statistically significant\ndifference to the disadvantage of sotorasib versus docetaxel.\nFor the AEs of fever (AE) and infections and infestations (AE), there is an effect modification\nby the age characteristic in each case. With regard to the AE of fever, there was a statistically\nsignificant difference for patients < 65 years of age to the advantage of sotorasib, whereas for\npatients ≥ 65 years of age there was no statistically significant difference between the\ntreatment arms. With regard to the AE of infections and infestations (AE), there was a\nstatistically significant difference for patients ≥ 65 years of age to the advantage of sotorasib,\nwhereas for patients < 65 years of age there was no statistically significant difference between\nthe treatment arms.\nThis eff ect modification is not evident in other endpoints. Overall, the significance of the\navailable subgroup results is considered insufficient for the assessment of the additional\nbenefit.\nPatient-reported Outcome - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE)\nIn the CodeBreak 200 study, side effects were also recorded with the PRO -CTCAE instrument.\nHowever, it is not clear from the available documents on what basis the events were selected\nfrom the PRO - CTCAE system. More detailed information on the procedure was not provided\nby the pharmaceutical company. It is also not possible to tell whether the side effects of\nsotorasib and docetaxel are adequately shown. Overall, the results of the PRO -CTCAE cannot\nbe used.\nIn the overall assessment of the results on side effects, neither an advantage nor a\ndisadvantage for treatment with sotorasib compared to docetaxel can be found.\nOverall assessment / conclusion\nFor the assessment of the additional benefit of sotorasib in adults with advanced NSCLC with\nKRAS p.G12C mutation after first - line therapy with an anti -PD 1/PD- L1 in combination with\nplatinum - containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti -PD 1/PD- L1 and\nplatinum - containing chemotherapy, results on mortality, morbidity, health -rel ated quality of\nlife and side effects are available from the open - label, randomised, controlled phase III\nCodeBreak 200 study.\nIn the CodeBreak 200 study, sotorasib was compared to docetaxel.\nFor the endpoint of overall survival, no statistically significa nt difference was detected\nbetween the treatment arms.\nWith regard to the endpoints of symptomatology and health status, which were assessed in\nthe CodeBreak 200 study by means of the EORTC QLQ - C30, EORTC QLQ - LC13, BPI -SF, FACT-G\nGP5, and PGI-C questionnaires, there are uncertainties resulting from the differential\npercentage of patients of > 15 percentage points included in the evaluations between the\ntreatment arms. With regard to the evaluations of the EQ - 5D VAS, there is a statistically\nsignificant diff erence for the endpoint of health status to the advantage of sotorasib over\ndocetaxel. In the overall analysis of the results, an advantage of sotorasib can be determined\nwith regard to morbidity , the extent of which cannot be quantified.\nNo assessable dat a are available for the endpoint category of health - related quality of life\nassessed using the functional scales of the EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaire.\nIn the overall assessment of the results on side effects, neither an advantage nor a\ndisadvantage for treatment with sotorasib compared to docetaxel can be found.\nIn the overall assessment, therefore, a non-quantifiable additional benefit over docetaxel is\nidentified for sotorasib as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with advanced NSCLC with\nKRAS p.G 12C mutation after first- line therapy with an anti -PD-1/PD- L1 in combination with\nplatinum - containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti -PD-1/PD- L1 and\nplatinum - containing chemotherapy for which docetaxel is the appropriate patient -individual\ntherapy.\nReliability of data (probability of additional benefit)\nThe present benefit assessment is based on the results of the randomised, open - label phase\nIII CodeBreak 200 study.\nThe risk of bias across endpoints at the study level is rated as generally low for the CodeBreak\n200 study. However, there are uncertainties regarding the implementation of the criteria\nspecified in the context of the appropriate comparator therapy for the treatment decision for\nthe use of docetaxel as an appropriate patien t- individual therapeutic alternative.\nThe risk of bias of the results for the endpoint of overall survival is rated as high. This is justified\nby the high percentage of patients who switch from the docetaxel arm to the sotorasib arm\nduring the course of th e study and due to the unclear percentage of censoring at the start of\nthe study.\nAt the endpoint level of the endpoint category of side effects and for the endpoint of health\nstatus, the risk of bias is classified as high due to the differential percentages of patients\nincluded in the evaluations between the treatment arms.\nFor the endpoints of health status, discontinuation due to AEs, non -severe and non-serious\nspecific AEs, the lack of blinding additionally contributes to the high risk of bias of the results.\nOverall, a hint is derived for the reliability of data of the a dditional benefit identified.\nc2) Adults for whom a therapy other than docetaxel is the appropriate patient -individual\ntherapy\nAn additional benefit is not proven.\nJustification\nFor the sub- population of adults with advanced non - small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS\np.G12C mutation after first - line therapy with an anti -PD-1/PD- L1 in combination with\nplatinum - containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti -PD-1/PD- L1 and\nplatinum - containing chemotherapy and for whom a therapy other than doce taxel is the\nappropriate patient - individual therapy, no statements on the additional benefit can be made\ntaking into account the CodeBreak 200 study. Since only results with a comparison to\ndocetaxel were presented for the benefit assessment, no usable dat a are available overall.
