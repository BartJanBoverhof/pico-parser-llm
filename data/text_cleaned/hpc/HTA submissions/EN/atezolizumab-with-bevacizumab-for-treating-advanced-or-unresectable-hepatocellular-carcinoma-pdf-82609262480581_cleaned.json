The clinical experts advised that both\ndrugs are first-line treatment options in NHS practice, although there is some regional variation across England in which is preferred.

The ERG did exploratory analyses to test the effect on cost\neffectiveness of bodyweight (less than 60 kg compared with 60 kg or more) and region (all regions compared with excluding Asian regions,\nexcept Japan). The ERG explained that it was important to explore the\npotential effect of bodyweight because the dosing of lenvatinib and bevacizumab depend on bodyweight, so it affects associated drug costs.\nIt explained that region was also potentially important because the underlying cause of HCC varies by region. Hepatitis C is more common in\nEurope, North America and Japan, and hepatitis B is more common in\nAsia (excluding Japan) and Africa. In Europe and North America, HCC is\nincreasingly associated with metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, obesity and exposure to toxic substances.

Interim funding will end 90 days after positive final\nguidance is published (or 30 days in the case of drugs with an Early\nAccess to Medicines Scheme designation or fast track appraisal), at which point funding will switch to routine commissioning budgets. The\nNHS England and NHS Improvement Cancer Drugs Fund list provides up to-date information on all cancer treatments recommended by NICE\nsince 2016. This includes whether they have received a marketing\nauthorisation and been launched in the UK.\n4.3 The Welsh ministers have issued directions to the NHS in Wales on\nimplementing NICE technology appraisal guidance. When a NICE\ntechnology appraisal recommends the use of a drug or treatment, or other technology, the NHS in Wales must usually provide funding and\nresources for it within 2 months of the first publication of the final appraisal document.\n4.4 When NICE recommends a treatment 'as an option', the NHS must make\nsure it is available within the period set out in the paragraphs above. Th\nmeans that, if a patient has advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and the doctor responsible for their care thinks that\natezolizumab with bevacizumab is the right treatment, it should be available for use, in line with NICE's recommendations.\n© NICE 2024.
