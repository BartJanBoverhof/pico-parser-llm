Lung cancer samples ar e commonly acquir ed\nfor diagnosis using br onchoscop y, endobr onchial ultrasound (EBUS) or a per cutaneous procedur e (guided b y CT or ultrasound).\nLung cancer has 2 main types:\n• non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCL C), which is mor e common and spr eads mor e slo wly\n• small-cell lung cancer (SCL C), which is rar er and spr eads mor e quickly .\nTreatment depends on t he type, siz e, position and stage of t he cancer , and t he person's healt h. Possible tr eatment s include radiot herap y, syst emic anti-cancer t herapies, sur gery,\nsuppor tive car e cryotherap y, phot odynamic t herap y and ablation.
