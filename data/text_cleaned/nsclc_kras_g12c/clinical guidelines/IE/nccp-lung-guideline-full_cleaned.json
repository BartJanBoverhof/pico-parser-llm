      "text": "Providing standardised clinical care to patients in healthcare is challenging. This is due to a number of factors, among them variations in environments of care and complex patient presentations. It is self- evident that safe, effective care and treatment are important in ensuring that patients get the best outcomes from their care.\nThe Department of Health is of the view that supporting evidence-based practice, through the clinical effectiveness framework, is a critical element of the health service to deliver safe and high quality care. The National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) is a Ministerial committee set up in 2010 as a key recommendation of the report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance (2008). The establishment of the Commission was prompted by an increasing awareness of patient safety issues in general and high profile health service system failures at home and abroad.\nThe NCEC on behalf of the Department of Health has embarked on a quality assured National Clinical Guideline development process linked to service delivery priorities. Furthermore, implementing National Clinical Guidelines sets a standard nationally, to enable healthcare professionals to deliver safe and effective care and treatment while monitoring their individual, team and organisation’s performance.\nThe aim of these National Clinical Guidelines is to reduce unnecessary variations in practice and provide a robust basis for the most appropriate healthcare in particular circumstances. As a consequence of Ministerial mandate, it is expected that NCEC National Clinical Guidelines are implemented across all relevant services in the Irish healthcare setting.\nThe NCEC is a partnership between key stakeholders in patient safety. NCEC’s mission is to provide a framework for national endorsement of clinical guidelines and audit to optimise patient and service user care. The NCEC has a remit to establish and implement processes for the prioritisation and quality assurance of clinical guidelines and clinical audit so as to recommend them to the Minister for Health to become part of a suite of National Clinical Guidelines and National Clinical Audit. The aim of the suite of National Clinical Guidelines is to provide guidance and standards for improving the quality, safety and cost-effectiveness of healthcare in Ireland. The implementation of these National Clinical Guidelines will support the provision of evidence-based and consistent care across Irish healthcare services.",

      "text": "Cancer is a major healthcare challenge. Each year in Ireland, approximately 20,804 people are diagnosed with invasive cancer. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Ireland after diseases of the circulatory system.\nDeaths from cancer averaged about 8,655 deaths per year during 2011-2013, representing about 30% of all deaths in that period (NCRI, 2016).\nLung cancer was the single most common cause of cancer death in Ireland from 2011-2012 (See Section 3.1 Epidemiology). Averaging 1,827 deaths annually, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both sexes (NCRI, 2016). The incidence of lung cancer in Ireland is projected to rise more rapidly in females than in males. By 2040 the rate of lung cancer is projected to increase by 136% in females (Nordpred model) and 52% in males (NCRI, 2014).\nCancer incidence data from the National Cancer Registry Ireland (NCRI) and population projections from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) have been combined by the NCRI to estimate the number of new cancer cases expected in five year bands from 2015 to 2040. The total number of new invasive cancer cases (including non-melanoma skin cancer) is projected to increase by 84% for females and 107% for males between 2010 and 2040, based only on changes in population size and age distribution (demography). If trends in incidence since 1994 are also taken into account, the number of cases is expected to increase by between 86% and 125% for females (depending on the method of projection used) and by between 126% and 133% for males (NCRI, 2014).\nIn Ireland, there are eight hospitals designated as cancer centres and one satellite breast unit (Letterkenny General Hospital). A cancer centre is characterised by the geographic concentration of all oncology disciplines with sub-specialised expertise on a tumour specific/discipline basis to provide the critical mass and support to achieve best practice in cancer care.\nAs well as these designated cancer centres, other hospitals provide cancer services such as chemotherapy (Figure 1).\nDesignated Cancer Centres\n111 Mater Misericordiae Hospital St. Vincent's University Hospital 222 9999 Beaumont Hospital 333 St. James's Hospital 444 Cork University Hospital 555 666 Waterford Regional Hospital 777 Mid-Western Regional Hospital Limerick 888 University College Hospital Galway 4444 2255 Letterkenny General Hospital (satellite of 99 Galway for breast and rectal cancer)",

Discussion of performance data, improvement plans, resources including manpower, service planning and development takes place at regular review meetings between the NCCP and senior management at cancer centre and Hospital Group level. This provides an opportunity to share good practice from other cancer centres, if relevant. Where resource issues are identified, these are included in the service planning process. As specific issues arise in hospitals, these are managed by senior hospital management.\nA Lead Clinician has been nominated for each of the common tumour sites (e.g. breast, lung, prostate, colorectal) in each of the designated cancer centres, and for rarer tumour sites (e.g. oesophageal cancer) in those centres which offer a service for that cancer. The Lead Clinician chairs the governance arrangements for their service within the cancer centre and participates in a National Leads forum for that tumour site. In order to operate as a cohesive national clinical network for the purpose of clinical audit, sharing of good practice and problem solving, the lead clinicians from the cancer centres meet collectively as a National Lead Clinicians Network. This supports consistency of care across the eight cancer centres.\nThe National Cancer Strategy (DoHC, 2006) recommended that national site-specific multidisciplinary groups be convened to develop national evidence-based clinical guidelines for cancer care. The principal objective of developing these guidelines is to improve the quality of care received by patients.\nA Guideline Development Group was established to develop evidence based guidelines for the diagnosis, staging and treatment of patients with lung cancer.\nThe National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 (DoH, 2017) recommends: The NCCP will develop further guidelines for cancer care in line with National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) standards.",

This may be a concern if radical radiotherapy is being considered and the primary tumour is distant from the hilum. (SIGN, 2014)\nCT scanning of mediastinal nodes (N2/3)\nFor all categories of patients with lung cancer, the reliability of CT in the assessment of mediastinal nodes is poor with average false positive and negative rates of 45% and 13% respectively (Detterbeck et al., 2001a). The false negative rate is higher with central tumours and adenocarcinomas (22% and 19%). (SIGN, 2014)\nPET scanning of mediastinal nodes (N2/3)\n18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG PET-CT) is more accurate than CT in detecting mediastinal nodal metastases in patients with NSCLC (Birim et al., 2005). The false negative rate of FDG PET in mediastinal nodes of 10 mm in short axis diameter on CT was very low (5%) (de Langen et al., 2006). (SIGN, 2014)\nThe false negative rate of FDG PET in mediastinal nodes >15 mm in short axis diameter on CT was relatively high (21%) (de Langen et al., 2006). These patients should have mediastinal nodal sampling before radical surgery, unless FDG PET-CT reveals distant metastases.\nFDG PET-CT staging may be limited by the pathology type, metabolic activity and location of the primary tumour, and status of the hilar nodes. Mediastinal nodal sampling may be considered in patients with central tumours, low FDG uptake in the primary tumour, PET positive N1 node, or enlarged nodes on CT (ACCP, 2007, De Leyn et al., 2007). (SIGN, 2014)\nThe specificity of FDG PET in mediastinal nodal staging is approximately 80% (Silvestri et al., 2007). Given a relatively high false positive rate, FDG PET positive mediastinal nodes should be confirmed with nodal sampling, if this will alter management (Silvestri et al., 2007). (SIGN, 2014)\nA Cochrane report (Schmidt-Hansen et al., 2014) included 45 prospective and retrospective studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of integrated PET-CT for diagnosing N2 disease in patients with\nsuspected resectable NSCLC. Two primary analyses were conducted as the criteria for test positivity – activity > background and SUVmax ≥ 2.5. The summary sensitivity and specificity estimates for activity > background test positivity were 77.4% (95% CI 65.3 to 86.1) and 90.1% (95% CI 85.3 to 93.5), respectively. The summary sensitivity and specificity estimates for SUVmax ≥ 2.5 were 81.3% (95% CI 70.2 to 88.9) and 79.4% (95% CI 70 to 86.5), respectively. Substantial heterogeneity was observed in both analyses. The study concluded that the sensitivity and specificity although reasonable, is insufficient to allow management based on PET-CT alone. PET-CT should form part of a clinical pathway supported by other investigations and cannot be used as a stand-alone test.",

This is usually where there are one or more peripheral lesions. CT is used to guide biopsy where lesions are in difficult to reach locations or where they are completely surrounded by aerated lung. Ultrasound is used where the lesion abuts the chest wall and is visible on ultrasound. (NICE, 2011)\nPercutaneous FNA/biopsy is a highly sensitive technique for diagnosing lung cancer (sensitivity of 88– 92%) (Schreiber and McCrory, 2003, Detterbeck and Rivera, 2001b). Fine needle aspirations can be guided by fluoroscopy, ultrasound, CT or MRI. Larger cutting needles can also be used to obtain biopsy cores of intact tissue for histology. Sensitivity is greater for peripheral lung lesions than fibre optic bronchoscopy (Detterbeck and Rivera, 2001b). There is a high false negative rate (25%) resulting in limited ability to confirm a benign diagnosis. This may be improved by using core biopsies for histology rather than aspirates for cytology (Detterbeck and Rivera, 2001b). (SIGN, 2014)\nYao et al. (2012) performed a systematic review which compared fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) with core-needle biopsy (CB) for diagnostic characteristics and yields for diagnosing lung cancer in patients with lung lesions. For overall diagnostic characteristics (benign vs. malignant) of FNA and CB, the ranges of sensitivity, specificity and of accuracy are displayed in Table 1. For specific diagnostic characteristics of FNA and CB (identifying the histologic subtype of malignancies or the specific benign diagnoses), the ranges of sensitivity, specificity and of accuracy are displayed in Table 2.

A total of 3,052 lesions from 39 studies were included. The pooled diagnostic yield was 70%, which is higher than the yield for traditional transbronchial biopsy. The yield increased as the lesion size increased. The pneumothorax rate was 1.5%, which is significantly smaller than that reported for transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA). The results showed that the diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopic techniques is better than that of traditional transbronchial biopsy. Although the yield remains lower than that of TTNA, the procedural risk is lower. However guided bronchoscopy allows both sampling of mediastinal lymph nodes and peripheral lung nodules in appropriately selected patients during the same procedure. Guided bronchoscopy may be an alternative or be complementary to TTNA for tissue sampling of pulmonary nodules, but further study is needed to determine its role in the evaluation of peripheral pulmonary lesions.\nFlexible bronchoscopy has a lower diagnostic sensitivity for peripheral lesions compared with central lesions. Fluoroscopy may improve the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy in sampling peripheral lesions but diagnostic yield remains lower than TTNA/biopsy (Detterbeck and Rivera, 2001a, Schreiber and McCrory, 2003).

It is well tolerated and complication rates are low. The treatment can be delivered in a single session, usually requiring only a short admission. RFA is suitable for small tumours, usually of 3 cm diameter or less, although larger lesions may be considered suitable in certain circumstances. (Lim et al., 2010)\nNo data have been published so far on the combination of RFA with chemotherapy for early stage non- small cell lung cancer. (Lim et al., 2010)\nLanuti et al. (2012) performed 55 ablations in 45 patients (age, 51 to 89 years) with stage I NSCLC. At a median follow-up of 32 months, locoregional recurrence (LRR) occurred in 21 (38%) within a mean of 12±10 (range, 1-44) months from RFA. Recurrence was observed locally in the tumour bed in 18 (33%), in regional nodes in 4 (7%), and distant in 2 (4%). The mean maximal tumour diameter was 2.3±1.3 (range, 0.7 to 4.5) cm. In tumours exceeding 3 cm, 10 (80%) were associated with LRR. Recurrent lesions were treated with repeat RFA (5), radiotherapy (8), chemoradiotherapy (5), and chemotherapy (2). Local control was achieved by repeat RFA in 2 of 5 (40%) or by radiotherapy in 8 lesions (100%), with 2 regional nodal failures (median follow-up, 40±13 months). Overall survival among patients who did or did not experience LRR was similar (32% to 35%). Repeat RFA was not associated with any significant complications or procedure-related 30-day mortality. The authors concluded lung RFA is associated with increased rates of local failure in tumours exceeding 3 cm and in contact with larger segmental vessels. However, patients with local failure can be promptly salvaged with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SBRT/SABR) or repeat RFA, without detriment to overall survival.\nA retrospective cohort study (Hiraki et al., 2011) comprising of 50 non-surgical candidates (29 men and 21 women; mean age, 74.7 years) with clinical stage I (Ia, n = 38; Ib, n = 12) histologically proven non–small cell lung cancer treated a total of 52 tumours with 52 ablation sessions. The median follow-up period was 37 months. Local progression was observed in 16 (31%) of the 52 tumours. The median survival time was 67 months. The overall, cancer-specific, and disease-free survivals were 94%, 100%, and 82% at 1 year, 86%, 93%, and 64% at 2 years, and 74%, 80%, and 53% at 3 years, respectively. The authors concluded RFA of clinical stage I non–small cell lung cancer was minimally invasive and provided promising patient survival, although the local efficacy needs to be improved.",

      "text": "A meta-analysis (Gould et al., 2001), two prospective studies (Brink et al., 2004, Bradley et al., 2004) and a focused review (Kalemkerian and Gadgeel, 2013) addressed this clinical question.\nA meta-analysis to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET for malignant focal pulmonary lesions (Gould et al., 2001) found FDG-PET is an accurate non-invasive imaging test for diagnosis of pulmonary nodules and larger mass lesions, although few data exist for nodules smaller than 1 cm in diameter. In current practice, FDG-PET has high sensitivity and intermediate specificity for malignancy.\nBrink et al. (2004) performed FDG-PET in 120 consecutive patients with SCLC during primary staging. Complete agreement between FDG-PET results and other staging procedures was observed in 75 patients. Differences occurred in 45 patients at 65 sites. In 47 sites the FDG-PET results were proven to be correct, and in ten, incorrect. In the remaining eight sites, the discrepancies could not be clarified. In 14/120 patients, FDG-PET caused a stage migration, correctly upstaging ten patients to extensive disease and downstaging three patients by not confirming metastases of the adrenal glands previously suspected on CT. Only 1/120 patients was incorrectly staged by FDG-PET, owing to failure to detect brain metastases. In all cases the stage migration led to a significant change in the treatment protocol. Sensitivity of FDG- PET was significantly superior to that of CT in the detection of extrathoracic lymph node involvement (100% vs 70%, specificity 98% vs 94%) and distant metastases except to the brain (98% vs 83%, specificity 92% vs 79%). However, FDG-PET was significantly less sensitive than cranial MRI/CT in the detection of brain metastases (46% vs 100%, specificity 97% vs 100%).\nBradley et al. (2004) prospectively performed pretreatment FDG-PET on 24 patients determined by conventional staging methods to have limited-stage SCLC. FDG-PET correctly upstaged two (8.3%) of 24 patients to extensive-stage disease (95% CI, 1.03% to 27.0%). PET correctly identified tumour in each SCLC mass (primary or nodal) that was suspected on CT imaging, thus giving a lesion-based sensitivity relative to CT of 100%. PET identified unsuspected regional nodal metastasis in six (25%) of 24 patients, and the radiation therapy plan was significantly altered to include the PET-positive/CT-negative nodes within the high-dose region in each of these patients. The authors concluded FDG-PET has high sensitivity for SCLC and appears to be of value for initial staging and treatment planning of patients with presumed limited-stage disease.\nA focused review published in the Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (Kalemkerian and Gadgeel, 2013) included 14 studies comparing pretreatment FDG-PET with conventional staging procedures for the initial staging of patients with SCLC. Seven studies evaluated changes in initi al management based on PET-CT in patients with SCLC (Kamel et al., 2003, Bradley et al., 2004, Blum et al., 2004, Kut et al., 2007, van Loon et al., 2008, van Loon et al., 2010). Overall, PET findi ngs led to a change in initial management in 28% (range, 0%–47%) of 211 patients. Of the 59 patients with a change in management, 32% underwent an alteration in the general treatment plan as a result of stage shift, whereas 68% had changes in the extent of the radiation field for the treatment of limited-stage SCLC. The study concluded that PET-CT can improve both staging acc uracy and treatment planning in patients with SCLC, although further prospective studies are needed to fully define its role.",

(Herth et al., 2016 - UpToDate®).\nEndobronchial surgical debulking of the cancer can be undertaken using either rigid or flexible bronchoscopy. Advantages of rigid bronchoscopic procedures under general anaesthesia include the ability to remove large pieces of cancer, maintain adequate ventilation, and allow control of large volume haemorrhage. Nonetheless, flexible bronchoscopy is increasingly used for debulking procedures. These treatments are usually given to palliate symptoms and improve quality of life, but in some patients, relief of endobronchial obstruction will allow assessment for subsequent treatment with curative intent. (NICE, 2011)\nEndobronchial techniques available are either a) used to debulk the cancer (brachytherapy, electrocautery, cryotherapy, thermal laser ablation and photodynamic therapy) or b) used to maintain/ re-establish airway patency (endobronchial stenting). Thermal ablation, surgical debulking and stent insertion were all favoured options where immediate relief of endobronchial obstruction is required, especially if there is a relatively large cancer. Endobronchial debulking procedures are generally not suitable in cases where the predominant cause of airway obstruction is extrinsic compression. In such cases airway stenting to maintain/re-establish airway patency and/or external beam radiotherapy aimed at treating the surrounding cancer may be considered. External beam radiotherapy is effective in around two-thirds of patients and is less invasive than the other endobronchial treatments (NICE, 2011).",

Indeed, recent advances in targeted therapies (e.g. tyrosine kinase inhibitors and angiogenesis inhibitors) have made the distinction between adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the lung even more important (Besse et al., 2007, Cohen et al., 2007, Herbst, 2006, Herbst and Sandler, 2008, Johnson et al., 2004, Lam and Watkins, 2007) because not only are tyrosine kinase inhibitors more efficacious in adenocarcinomas than in squamous cell carcinomas, but also the use of antiangiogenic modalities can be associated with life-threatening pulmonary haemorrhage in squamous cell carcinomas (Besse et al., 2007, Herbst, 2006).

      "text": "At the present time, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) seems to be the single best marker for adenocarcinoma. TTF-1 provides the added value of serving as a pneumocyte marker that can help confirm a primary lung origin in 75 to 85% of lung adenocarcinomas (Motoi et al., 2008, Yatabe et al., 2002, Lau et al., 2002). This can be very helpful in addressing the question of metastatic adenocarcinoma from other sites such as the colon or breast. Diastase-periodic acid Schiff or mucicarmine mucin stains may also be of value. p63 is consistently reported as a reliable marker for squamous histology and CK5/6 also can be useful (Loo et al., 2010, Nicholson et al., 2010, Camilo et al., 2006, Wu et al., 2003, Chu and Weiss, 2002, Ordonez, 2000, Kaufmann and Dietel, 2000, Kargi et al., 2007, Khayyata et al., 2009). (Travis et al., 2011)\nNapsin A appears to be a useful marker when used in combination with TTF-1 as it provides increased sensitivity and specificity for both classifying primary lung tumours as adenocarcinoma and for identifying lung origin in the setting of a metastatic adenocarcinoma (Bishop et al., 2010).\nIt is possible that cocktails of nuclear and cytoplasmic markers (TTF-1/CK5/6 or p63/napsin-A) may allow for use of fewer immunohistochemical studies of multiple antibodies (Rossi et al., 2009a). (Travis et al., 2011)\nStrategic use of small biopsy and cytology samples is important, i.e., use the minimum specimen necessary for an accurate diagnosis, to preserve as much tissue as possible for potential molecular studies (Suh et al., 2011). Methods that use substantial amounts of tissue to make a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma, such as large panels of immunohistochemical stains or molecular studies, may not provide an advantage over routine light microscopy with a limited immunohistochemical workup (Rossi et al., 2009b). (Travis et al., 2011)\nImmunohistochemical stains to distinguish between primary lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are p63, p40, CK 5/6 (present in squamous cell carcinoma) and TTF-1, Napsin A (present in adenocarcinoma).\nEvery effort should be made, during the diagnostic phase, to preserve tumour material for molecular biomarker analysis.

One hundred and twenty patients suspected of having lung cancer with hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy were randomised to undergo EBUS-TBNA with or without ROSE. The sensitivity and accuracy for diagnosing lung cancer were 88% and 89% in the ROSE group, and 86% and 89% in the non-ROSE group, respectively. No complications were associated with the procedures. Additional procedures including EBUS-TBNA for lesions other than the main target lesion and/or transbronchial biopsy in the same setting were performed in 11% of patients in the ROSE group and 57% in the non-ROSE group (p<0.001). Mean puncture number was significantly lower in the ROSE group (2.2 vs. 3.1 punctures, p<0.001), and mean bronchoscopy time was similar between both groups (22.3 vs. 22.1 min, p=0.95). The authors concluded that ROSE during EBUS-TBNA is associated with a significantly lower need for additional bronchoscopic procedures and puncture number.\nIn addition an RCT of 168 patients with enlarged lymph nodes were randomised to undergo TBNA with or without ROSE (Trisolini et al., 2011). There was no significant difference between the TBNA group and the ROSE group in terms of diagnostic yield (75% vs 78%, respectively; p=0.64), and percentage of adequate specimens (87% vs 78%, respectively; p=0.11). However, similar to the findings reported by Oki et al.

      "text": "For a limited resection to be adequate oncologically, a precise pre- and intra-operative diagnosis is critical. The accuracy of intra-operative frozen section analysis in determining whether small lung adenocarcinomas have an invasive component still needs to be defined. The predictive value of frozen section ranges from 93% to 100% but not all articles clearly report the accuracy of frozen section analysis (Yamato et al., 2001, Yamada and Kohno, 2004, Yoshida et al., 2005, Watanabe et al., 2005). In addition, evaluation of margins by frozen section may be problematic, especially when stapler cartridges have been used on both sides. Scraping or washing of staple lines with subsequent cytological analysis has been attempted (Higashiyama et al., 2003, Utsumi et al., 2010). When a sublobar resection is performed, frozen section analysis of an interlobar, hilar, or any suspicious lymph node is a useful staging evaluation, and when positive nodes are found, a lobectomy is indicated when there is no functional cardiopulmonary limitation. (Travis et al., 2011)\nMarchevsky et al., (2004) reviewed the frozen section diagnoses of 183 consecutive pulmonary nodules smaller than 1.5 cm in diameter and calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of this diagnostic procedure. One hundred and seventy four nodules were correctly classified by frozen section as neoplastic or non-neoplastic, six lesions were diagnosed equivocally, and two neoplasms were missed owing to sampling errors. The sensitivities for a diagnosis of neoplasia were 86.9% and 94.1% for nodules smaller than 1.1 cm in diameter and measuring 1.1 to 1.5 cm, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of frozen sections was significantly better in nodules larger than 1.0 cm in diameter (p=0.05). There were no false-positive diagnoses of malignancy, resulting in 100% specificity.\nIntraoperative consultation with frozen section is a sensitive and specific procedure for the diagnosis of malignancy from small pulmonary nodules. The distinction between lepidic pattern adenocarcinoma and atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, and of small peripheral carcinoid tumours from other lesions, can be difficult by frozen section (Marchevsky et al., 2004).",

      "text": "Two clinical guidelines (Travis et al., 2011, Lindeman et al., 2013) addressed this clinical question.\nCytology is a powerful tool in the diagnosis of lung cancer, in particular in the distinction of adenocarcinoma from squamous cell carcinoma (Rivera et al., 2007). In a recent study of 192 preoperative cytology diagnoses, definitive versus favoured versus unclassified diagnoses were observed in 88% versus 8% versus 4% of cases, respectively (Rekhtman et al., 2011). When compared with subsequent resection specimens, the accuracy of cytologic diagnosis was 93% and for definitive diagnoses, it was 96%. For the adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma cases, only 3% of cases were unclassified, and the overall accuracy was 96%. When immunohistochemistry was used in 9% of these cases, the accuracy was 100% (Rekhtman et al., 2011). (Travis et al., 2011)\nWhenever possible, cytology should be used in conjunction with histology in small biopsies (Nicholson et al., 2010, Sigel et al., 2011). In another study where small biopsies were evaluated in conjunction with cytology for the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma versus unclassified non- small cell lung cancer-not otherwise specified (NSCLC-NOS), the result for cytology was 70% versus 19% versus 11% and for biopsies, it was 72%, 22%, and 6%, respectively (Sigel et al., 2011). Still when cytology was correlated with biopsy, the percentage of cases diagnosed as NSCLC-NOS was greatly reduced to only 4% of cases (Sigel et al., 2011). In a small percentage of cases (<5%), cytology was more informative than histology in classifying tumours as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma (Sigel et al., 2011). The factors that contributed the greatest to difficulty in a specific diagnosis in both studies were poor differentiation, low specimen cellularity, and squamous histology (Rekhtman et al., 2011, Sigel et al., 2011). (Travis et al., 2011)\nSmall biopsies and/or cytologic samples including pleural fluids can be used for many molecular analyses (Rekhtman et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2008, Wu et al., 2008, Li et al., 2008, Lim et al., 2009, Savic et al., 2008, Miller et al., 2008, Kimura et al., 2006, Borczuk et al., 2004, Zudaire et al., 2008, Gordon et al., 2003, Solomon et al., 2010, Asano et al., 2006, Otani et al., 2008). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation testing and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation testing are readily performed on these specimens (Rekhtman et al., 2011, Sigel et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2008, Li et al., 2008, Lim et al., 2009, Savic et al., 2008, Miller et al., 2008, Kimura et al., 2006, Solomon et al., 2010, Asano et al., 2006, Otani et al., 2008). Formalin fixed paraffin-embedded samples can be used effectively for polymerase chain reaction-based mutation testing and for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH) testing for gene amplification and for immunohistochemistry. Cytology smears can be analysed for immunohistochemical and certain molecular studies, but it is far preferable if cell blocks are available. (Travis et al., 2011)\nSpecimen requirements for anaplastic lymphoma kinase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (ALK FISH) are generally similar to those for EGFR mutation testing: formalin fixation is acceptable, specimens should have enough cancer cells to analyse clearly, and DNA-damaging fixatives or acidic decalcifying agents should be avoided, as should specimens with abundant necrosis. Unlike EGFR mutation testing, however, FISH testing can be problematic when performed on alcohol fixed samples. (Lindeman et al., 2013)",

This prospective, multicentre randomised trial compared limited resection with lobectomy for patients with peripheral T1 N0 non-small cell lung cancer documented at operation, 247 of 276 randomised patients were considered eligible for analysis. No significant differences were observed for all stratification variables, selected prognostic factors, perioperative morbidity, mortality, or late pulmonary function. In patients undergoing limited resection, there was an observed 75% increase in recurrence rates (p=0.02, one-sided) attributable to an observed tripling of the local recurrence rate (p=0.008 two-sided), an observed 30% increase in overall death rate (p=0.08, one-sided), and an observed 50% increase in death with cancer rate (p=0.09, one- sided) compared to patients undergoing lobectomy (p=0.10, one-sided was the predefined threshold for statistical significance for this equivalency study). The authors concluded that when compared with lobectomy, limited pulmonary resection does not confer improved perioperative morbidity, mortality, or late postoperative pulmonary function.

However, numerous values have been used to define ‘prohibitive risk’ for lung surgery, and the studies are difficult to interpret owing to the widespread use of composite endpoints. When scrutinised, individual endpoints included lobar collapse, high levels of carbon dioxide tension (PCO ), arrhythmia and readmission to ICU. It is doubtful that many patients\nwould consider the risk of developing these complications as ‘prohibitive’ for surgical resection. (Lim et al., 2010)\nWith sample sizes ranging from 8 to 160 patients (Benzo et al., 2007) and an average death rate of 2.6% for lobectomy, the discriminating cut-off points for VO max to predict death is likely to be poor and,\nwithout valid risk adjustment, it is not possible to estimate an independent contribution of VO max.\nThe arbitrary use of cut-off values for defining patient groups with no adverse outcome carries a large degree of imprecision; for example, the 95% binomial CI of no adverse outcomes in a typical sample of 30 patients would be 0-13.6%. (Lim et al., 2010)\nPerhaps the best conducted study was the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALBG) Protocol 9238 in which 403 patients were classified into low, high and very high risk groups. Of the 68 patients in the very high risk group (VO max <15 ml/ kg/min), surgery was only undertaken at the ‘physician’s discretion’ with an\noperative mortality rate of 4% and no difference in postoperative complication rate. A central message from this study was that, in patients in the very high risk subgroup who underwent lung resection, the median survival was 36 months compared with 15.8 months for those in the same risk group who did not undergo surgical resection (p<0.001) (Loewen et al., 2007). The evidence for cardiopulmonary exercise\ntesting providing a useful definition of ‘high risk’ is therefore limited and there are no data available to show how it can help predict unacceptable levels of postoperative dyspnoea.

This has implications for surgical case selection and outcomes.\nFor patients who had undergone prior coronary bypass surgery, the risk of death and myocardial infarction was observed to be reduced from 5.8% and 1.9% to 2.4% and 1.2%, respectively (Eagle et al., 1997). (Lim et al., 2010)\nThe current evidence base that guides clinical management of the specific thoracic surgical patient with coronary artery disease is limited. (Lim et al., 2010)\nThoracoscore is a multifactorial risk assessment model to predict in-hospital mortality in various thoracic procedures. The model was first published by the French Society of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (Falcoz et al., 2007). Thoracoscore is recommended for use in the UK by the ‘British Thoracic Society’ and the ‘National Institute for Health and Care Excellence’ (NICE). However, a recent multicentre prospective study (Sharkey et al., 2015) aimed to evaluate Thoracoscore as a valid tool for use in patients undergoing lung resection at six UK centres. They found the mean thoracoscore was 2.66%, almost double the observed mortality of 1.38%. However, mean thoracoscore for the patients who died was statistically significantly higher than those who survived, 4.01% versus 2.64% (p<0.001).\nA history (including assessment of functional status), physical examination and resting ECG are prerequisites for cardiac risk assessment. All patients with an audible murmur or unexplained dyspnoea should also have an echocardiogram. The first step in cardiac risk assessment is to identify patients with an active cardiac condition, as they all require evaluation by a cardiologist and correction before surgery. (Lim et al., 2010)\nIn patients who do not have an active cardiac condition, risk assessment is performed using the revised cardiac index.\nTable 5, shows a validated model with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81 (Lee et al. 1999). (Lim et al., 2010)\nRevised cardiac risk index Table 5.\nNumber of Factors Risk of Major Cardiac Complication*\n0 0.4% 1 1% 2 7% ≥3 11% Risk factors: high-risk type of surgery (includes all thoracic surgery), ischaemic heart disease, history of congestive cardiac failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, insulin therapy for diabetes, preoperative serum creatinine >177 mmol/l.\n*Cardiac complications defined as myocardial infarction, pulmonary oedema, ventricular fibrillation or primary cardiac arrest, complete heart block. The risks have been quoted from the validation cohort.\nPatients with ≤2 risk factors and good cardiac functional capacity (able to climb a flight of stairs without cardiac symptoms) can proceed to surgery without further investigations. Patients with poor cardiac functional capacity or with ≥3 risk factors should have further investigations to screen for reversible cardiac ischaemia (e.g. exercise stress testing, exercise thallium scan) and, if necessary, cardiology review prior to surgery.

Multifocal lung cancers (MFLCs) are defined as multiple lesions arising from ground glass opacities (GGOs), which may have or develop a solid component. There may be a limited number or multiple lesions. The following patients are also included: those with a GGO lesion suspected or proven to be malignant and other small GGO lesions that are more likely adenomatous alveolar hyperplasia (AAH) than an invasive carcinoma because data suggest that AAH is a precursor to such tumours (Kakinuma et al., 2004, Nakata et al., 2004, Travis et al., 2005). Including such patients also satisfies the need for a clinically applicable definition. At the other end of the spectrum are patients with an infiltrative pattern of disease either confined to a particular area (segment or lobe) or appearing diffusely in the lung parenchyma (also called pneumonic type of adenocarcinoma). These conditions should also be included among multifocal cancers. (Kozower et al., 2013)\nThere is a growing body of data that demonstrates excellent survival after resection of small solitary GGO lesions (Howington et al., 2013). Furthermore, data support that sublobar resection of single lesions presenting as a GGO is adequate. Much fewer data have been published on the outcome of patients with multiple cancers presenting as GGO lesions (i.e., multifocal cancers). Good survival and a low recurrence rate after resection of MFLC have been reported (Kim et al., 2009, Park et al., 2009). (Kozower et al., 2013)\nIt is reasonable to suggest that limited resection of MFLCs should be performed. This is supported by the good outcomes of limited resection for single GGO lesions (Howington et al., 2013), the perception of a decreased propensity for nodal and systemic metastases, an increased propensity to develop new pulmonary foci of cancer, and the need to preserve lung parenchyma when patients present with multiple lesions. The good survival that is reported after resection argues for an aggressive, curative- intent approach rather than palliative treatment. (Kozower et al., 2013)\nOften, patients with MFLC also have lesions not believed to be malignant (i.e. < 10 mm pure GGO lesions, which are AAH in the majority). We suggest that these patients be approached according to the data available for isolated lesions with the same characteristics (Pastorino et al., 2003). Lesions that are sufficiently suspicious of being malignant should prompt treatment, whereas those that are not should continue to be observed. (Kozower et al., 2013)",

The distinction from metastatic disease may be clear when there are two separate histological subtypes. Where the same subtype is in both lesions, the criteria proposed by Martini and Melamed (1975) can be useful (Kozower et al., 2013).\nThe survival of patients with synchronous primary lung cancer is fairly variable, suggesting that a thoughtful approach is necessary in classifying two synchronous foci of cancer as two separate primary lung cancers. (Kozower et al., 2013)\nApproximately 60% of synchronous primary lung cancer reported in the past 25 years are squamous cell cancers, and in about 60% of the cases, the tumours are of the same histologic type (Van Bodegom et al., 1989, Deschamps et al., 1990, Rosengart et al., 1991, Antakli et al., 1995, Ribet and Dambron, 1995, Lee et al., 2008, Ferguson et al., 1985). (Kozower et al., 2013)\nThe average 5-year survival of patients who undergo resection is only about 25%, and that of patients with pathological stage I disease is about 40%. Nevertheless, this appears to be better than the natural history of untreated lung cancer (Detterbeck and Gibson, 2008). In the absence of distant metastases, lymph node involvement, or evidence that the second focus of cancer is a metastasis, resection is preferable to observation according to the available data.

The Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) recommends that at least six lymph node stations should be removed or sampled before the confirmation of pN0 status (Goldstraw, 2009). Three of these nodes/stations should be mediastinal (including the subcarinal station) and three should be from N1 stations (Lim et al., 2010).\nThere is considerable variation in practice, from no lymph node sampling through lobe-specific sampling to systematic nodal dissection. Postoperative morbidity is usually cited against the use of routine systematic nodal dissection and, in response to this, the results of the American ACOSOG Z30 trial confirm that patients randomised to complete mediastinal lymphadenectomy had little added morbidity compared with those who underwent lymph node sampling (Allen et al., 2006). Two trials comparing systematic nodal dissection with lymph node sampling reported better survival in patients randomised to systematic nodal dissection (Izbicki et al., 1995, Wu et al., 2002). (Lim et al., 2010)\nMediastinal lymph node dissection (MLND) does not improve long-term survival in patients with early- stage (T1 or T2, N0 or nonhilar N1) NSCLC who have pathologically negative mediastinal and hilar nodes after rigorous systematic preresection lymph node sampling. In such patients, mediastinal lymph node dissection also does not affect the rate of local or regional recurrence. Darling et al. states that the results do not apply to patients with T3 or T4 tumours or those with known hilar or N2 disease because they were not included in the study. Staging by PET-CT or CT alone is not equivalent to the invasive staging performed in this study, and surgeons cannot use this study to justify excluding invasive mediastinal staging from their evaluation of patients with early-stage NSCLC. (Darling et al., 2011)\nMediastinal lymph node dissection provides patients with the most accurate staging and the opportunity for adjuvant therapy if occult metastatic disease is present. Because current preoperative staging cannot definitively identify patients with mediastinal lymph node involvement, and because patients with known hilar or mediastinal disease (N2) or with T3 or T4 tumours may benefit from mediastinal lymph node dissection because the pre-test probability of N2 disease is higher, we still recommend that all patients with resectable NSCLC undergo mediastinal lymph node dissection because the procedure does not increase mortality or morbidity.

(Light and Doelken, 2015)\nThe optimal technique for pleurodesis in malignant pleural effusion has been investigated in a Cochrane review (Shaw and Agarwal, 2004). The main agent used in the UK for pleurodesis is talc. Talc appears to be the most effective sclerosant, with a relative risk for successful pleurodesis of 1.26 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.48) compared with bleomycin or tetracycline. Adult respiratory distress syndrome following talc pleurodesis has been reported as a complication in case reports but not in RCTs. Meta-analysis indicates there is no evidence of excess mortality with talc pleurodesis compared with other sclerosants. Thoracoscopic pleurodesis was found to be more effective than medical thoracostomy pleurodesis, with a relative risk of non-recurrence of an effusion of 1.19 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.36) in favour of thoracoscopic pleurodesis. There was no evidence for increased mortality following thoracoscopic pleurodesis. (SIGN, 2014)\nThere is evidence to support the use of tunnelled pleural catheters in the management of malignant pleural effusions when talc pleurodesis is not possible (Sabur et al., 2013, Suzuki et al., 2011, Thornton et al., 2010, Tremblay and Michaud, 2006). They provide a safe means of palliation of symptoms secondary to the effusion and enable the patient to be managed at home rather than hospital (Sudharshan et al., 2011). The main complications appear to be blockage or dislodgement of the catheter or seeding down the drain tract. In a retrospective audit seeding affected 6.7% of 45 patients (Janes et al., 2007). Spontaneous pleurodesis occurred in up to 25% of cases. Very few cases of pleural infection secondary to the drain have been reported (Janes et al., 2007). Achieving complete lung re-expansion prior to pleurodesis remains the most important prerequisite for success. (SIGN, 2014)\nSerial thoracentesis is commonly practiced.",

There was some evidence of heterogeneity between the trials (p=0.02, I 2 = 47%).\nA meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials evaluated the clinical benefit of adding a drug to single agent or 2-agent chemotherapy regimen in patients with advanced NSCLC (Delbaldo et al., 2007). In total, 57 trials (11,160 patients) were analysed. In the trials comparing a doublet regimen with a single-agent regimen, a significant increase was observed in tumour response (OR, 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.47; p<0.001) and 1-year survival (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.91; p<0.001) in favour of the doublet regimen. The median survival ratio was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79-0.89; p<0.001). An increase was also observed in the tumour response rate (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.58- 0.75; p<0.001) in favour of the triplet regimen, but not for 1-year survival (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.85-1.21; p=0.88). The median survival ratio was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.94-1.06; p=0.97). The study concluded that in patients with advanced NSCLC a second drug improved tumour response and survival rate and that adding a third drug had a weaker effect on tumour response and no effect on survival.\nA non inferiority, phase III, randomised study (Scagliotti et al., 2008) compared the overall survival of cisplatin/pemetrexed with cisplatin/gemcitabine in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced NSCLC. Overall survival for patients randomly assigned to cisplatin/pemetrexed was noninferior to the overall survival of patients assigned to cisplatin/gemcitabine (median overall survival, 10.3 vs. 10.3 months; HR 0.94, 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.05). However, in patients with adenocarcinoma randomly assigned to cisplatin/ pemetrexed, survival was significantly better than for those assigned to cisplatin/gemcitabine (12.6 v 10.9 months, respectively; p=0.03). This is supported by a recent meta-analysis (Pilkington et al., 2015) that combined the results from Scalgliotti et al. (2009) and Gronberg et al. (2009) and found that in patients with non-squamous disease, there is evidence that pemetrexed+platinum increases OS compared with gemcitabine+platinum (MA: HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.00; MTC-1: HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98).\nA number of phase II/III trials (Johnson et al., 2004, Sandler et al., 2006, Reck et al., 2009, Herbst et al., 2007, Niho et al., 2012) looked at the addition of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy. Additionally, four meta-analyses (Soria et al., 2013, Botrel et al., 2011, Cao et al., 2012, Lima et al., 2011) have addressed this issue, they broadly agree that the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC improves OS, PFS and RR. However, the absolute benefits are small and the adverse effects of treatment are considerable.",

(2016) concluded that erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib are effective in prolongation of PFS but not OS in EGFR M+ NSCLC patients with acceptable toxicity. Quality of life and response are closely linked, and the available data would favour selection of TKIs over chemotherapy as first-line treatment based on both these criteria. The review included six trials that measured quality of life for participants with EGFR M+ tumours by a number of different methods (two comparing afatinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy, two comparing erlotinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy, and two comparing gefitinib with cytotoxic chemotherapy); all six trials reported a beneficial effect of the TKI compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy. All three TKIs showed symptom palliation of cough, pain, and dyspnoea, although the methodology used was not standardised.\nThe majority of trials included people with a performance status (PS) of 1 and 2, but the data on AEs suggest that some PS 3 as well as elderly patients might tolerate the agents better than cytotoxic chemotherapy (Chen et al., 2012, Reck et al., 2010).",

They found that patients randomised to pemetrexed as maintenance therapy had longer overall survival compared with those who did not receive maintenance pemetrexed therapy (HR 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 0.89; p=0.0003, I 2 =0%). At a baseline risk of 51% at 12 months, there would be 8% (83 per 1000) fewer deaths at 12 months (95% CI from 40 fewer to 121 fewer) for patients who received pemetrexed maintenance therapy.\nThe three RCTs reported on quality of life and found either no difference in the majority of scores or significant delays in symptom deterioration in favour of patients who received pemetrexed maintenance treatment (Ciuleanu et al., 2009, Paz-Ares et al., 2012, Rittmeyer et al., 2013). (Kulkarni et al., 2015)\nA significant interaction was observed between histology (squamous versus non-squamous carcinoma) and treatment for progression-free survival and overall survival in Ciuleanu 2009. The two other RCTs included only patients with non-squamous histology (Barlesi et al., 2013, Paz-Ares et al., 2013). Meta- analysis with these two RCTs, plus the data from patients with non-squamous carcinoma from Ciuleanu 2009, found that patients with non-squamous cell histology who received pemetrexed as maintenance therapy had longer OS (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.86; p<0.0001) and PFS (HR 0.51; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.63; p<0.00001) compared with those who did not receive pemetrexed as maintenance therapy.

The reviews results were as follows:\nNon-platinum single-agent versus non-platinum combination therapy\nLow-quality evidence suggests that these treatments have similar effects on overall survival (HR 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.17; participants = 1062; five RCTs), one year OS (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.07; participants = 992; four RCTs), and PFS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07; participants = 942; four RCTs). Non-platinum combination therapy may better improve ORR compared with non-platinum single-agent therapy (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.26; participants = 1014; five RCTs; low-quality evidence). (Santos et al., 2015)\nDifferences in effects on major adverse events between treatment groups were as follows: anaemia: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.31; participants = 983; four RCTs; very low-quality evidence; neutropenia: RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.65; participants = 983; four RCTs; low-quality evidence; and\nthrombocytopenia: RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.89; participants = 914; three RCTs; very low-quality evidence. (Santos et al., 2015)\nNon-platinum therapy versus platinum combination therapy\nPlatinum combination therapy probably improves OS (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.85; participants = 1705; 13 RCTs; moderate quality evidence), 1 year OS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96; participants = 813; 13 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence), and ORR (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.85; participants = 1432; 11 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence) compared with non-platinum therapies.

However, proof of clinical benefit has not been documented. (O’Brien et al., 2006)\nO’Brien et al. (2006) randomly assigned patients with relapsed SCLC not considered as candidates for standard intravenous therapy to best supportive care (BSC) alone (n = 70) or oral topotecan (2.3 mg/m 2 /d, days 1 through 5, every 21 days) plus BSC (topotecan; n = 71). In the intent-to-treat population, survival was prolonged in the topotecan group (log-rank p=0.0104). Median survival with BSC was 13.9 weeks (95% CI, 11.1 to 18.6) and with topotecan, 25.9 weeks (95% CI, 18.3 to 31.6). Statistical significance for survival was maintained in a subgroup of patients with a short treatment-free interval (≤ 60 days). Response to topotecan was 7% partial and 44% stable disease. Patients on topotecan had slower quality of life deterioration and greater symptom control. Principal toxicities with topotecan were haematological: grade 4 neutropenia, 33%; grade 4 thrombocytopenia, 7%; and grade 3/4 anaemia, 25%. Comparing topotecan with BSC, infection grade 2 was 14% versus 12% and sepsis 4% versus 1%; other grade 3/4 events included vomiting 3% versus 0, diarrhoea 6% versus 0, dyspnoea 3% versus 9%, and pain 3% versus 6%. Toxic deaths occurred in four patients (6%) in the topotecan arm. All cause mortality within 30 days of random assignment was 13% on BSC and 7% on topotecan. Chemotherapy with oral topotecan is associated with prolongation of survival and quality of life benefit in patients with relapsed SCLC.\nvon Pawel et al. (2014) randomly assigned 637 patients with refractory or sensitive SCLC at a ratio of 2:1 to 21-day cycles of amrubicin 40 mg/m 2 intravenously (IV) on days 1 to 3 or topotecan 1.5 mg/m 2 IV on days 1 to 5. Median OS was 7.5 months with amrubicin versus 7.8 months with topotecan (HR 0.880; p=0.170); in refractory patients, median OS was 6.2 and 5.7 months, respectively (HR 0.77; p=0.047). Median PFS was 4.1 months with amrubicin and 3.5 months with topotecan (HR 0.802; p=0.018). ORR was 31.1% with amrubicin and 16.9% with topotecan (odds ratio, 2.223; p<0.001). Grade ≥ 3 treatment- emergent adverse events in the amrubicin and topotecan arms were: neutropenia (41% v 54%; p=0.004), thrombocytopenia (21% v 54%; p<0.001), anaemia (16% v 31%; p<0.001), infections (16% v 10%; p=0.043), febrile neutropenia (10% v 3%; p=0.003), and cardiac disorders (5% v 5%; p=0.759); transfusion rates were 32% and 53% (p<0.001), respectively.

No treatment-related deaths occurred as a consequence of SBRT although some other complications were associated with the treatment. In the surgery group, the operative mortality rate was 15/462 patients and 179/462 patients experienced complications associated with the surgical treatment. (NICE, 2011)\nGrills et al. (2010) reported that rates of freedom from any failure, causes-specific survival, distant metastasis and local, regional, and loco-regional recurrence did not differ significantly between patients with stage I NSCLC who had received treatment with either SBRT/SABR or wedge resection, but the overall survival rate was significantly higher in the surgery patients than in those patients who had received SBRT/SABR. A second set of analyses excluding patients with pT4, synchronous primary or no biopsy revealed similar results with the exception of the loco-regional occurrence rate which was now significantly higher in the patients who had received surgery. Multivariate analyses showed that in the patients who had received SBRT/SABR squamous histology and the presence of synchronous primary tumour were significant predictors of distant metastasis and in the patients who had received wedge resection, visceral pleural invasion and stage Ib were significant predictors of distant metastasis. In addition, in all patients, age > 71 years was a significant predictor of overall survival. No treatment- related deaths were observed as a consequence of either treatment, but a number of adverse events were associated with both treatments. (NICE, 2011)\nIn patients unfit for surgery, SBRT/SABR is the treatment of choice for peripherally located stage I NSCLC (if SBRT/SABR is not available, a hypofractionated radiotherapy schedule with a high biologically equivalent dose is advised). (Vansteenkiste et al., 2013)\nSBRT/SABR has led to improved population-based survival in elderly patients (Haasbeek et al., 2012), and the convenience of this outpatient therapy over three to eight visits has also led to a reduction in the proportion of untreated patients. The SBRT/SABR dose should be to a biologically equivalent tumour dose of ≥100 Gy, prescribed to the encompassing isodose. (Vansteenkiste et al., 2013)\nA systematic review comparing outcomes of SBRT/SABR and surgery in patients with severe COPD revealed a higher 30-day mortality following surgery but similar OS at 1 and 3 years (Palma et al., 2012). Analysis of SBRT/SABR outcomes in 676 patients found a median OS of 40.7 months, and actuarial 5-year\nrates of initial local, regional and distant recurrence of 10.5%, 12.7% and 19.9%, respectively (Senthi et al., 2012). A systematic review of SABR in centrally located tumours found local control rates of >85% with biologically equivalent doses ≥100 Gy (Senthi et al., 2013). The risk of high grade toxic effect was <9% when the biologically equivalent normal tissue dose was ≤210 Gy. Prospective trials of SBRT/SABR versus primary resection are now underway.

(2015) compared RFA and wedge resection in terms of disease recurrence and survival, as intent-to-treat therapy for stage I NSCLC in 121 marginal or non-surgical candidates.\nOver a 7 year period, 59 patients were treated for stage I NSCLC with wedge resection and 62 with RFA. At a median follow-up of 36 and 42 months for wedge resection and for RFA (p=0.232), local recurrence rate was 2 and 23%, respectively (p=0.002). The 1-, 2- and 5-year overall survival (disease-free interval) rates were 100% (96%), 96% (90%) and 52% (76%) for wedge resection, and 93% (87%), 72% (63%), and 35% (55%) for RFA (p=0.044 and p=0.01, respectively). None of the analysed parameters was found to be risk factor for disease recurrence and survival, except stage T2, which significantly affected disease- recurrence, overall and cancer-related survival and disease-free interval in the RFA group.\nNevertheless, the debate seems open for patients with stage Ia disease. In these cases, RFA seems to have equivalent outcomes compared with wedge resection, thus the selection of patients is more challenging due to the acceptable risk level, which depends also on the different success rate of the non-surgical alternative therapies. Further prospective randomised studies are necessary, in order to clearly compare the outcomes of different modality therapies, but also to better define patients considered at high risk. (Ambrogi et al., 2015)\nThere is some evidence to show radiofrequency ablation can achieve local tumour control in patients with clinical stage Ia tumours; however there are no published studies that determine its utility compared to other management strategies and further clinical trials comparing RFA to other local therapies are therefore needed.",

Using isotoxic dose escalation, 4D planning in this study would allow, on average, an additional increase in total dose by a factor of 1.19 compared with 3D planned dose escalation. For 55 Gy in 20 fractions with a BED of 70.13 Gy this would mean an average increase to a BED of 83.3 Gy . Some\nstudies suggest that an increase in absolute dose of 1 Gy is associated with a 3% reduction in death (Kong et al., 2005). By optimising dose prescription, potential gains for the patient in tumour control probability (TCP) can be realised while balancing the risk of acceptable normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) (Machtay et al., 2012). Mean Lung Dose (MLD) was lower for 19/20 of 4D planned cases, with an average reduction from 13.1 Gy to 11.1 Gy. This reduction in MLD can allow for dose escalation and where this is not possible, such as for conventional treatments that are not adapted or escalated, could theoretically lead to lower lung toxicity rates. (Cole et al., 2014)\nFour-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) based plans had lower planning target volume (PTV), a lower dose to organs at risk and lower predicted NTCP rates on LKB modelling (p<0.006). The clinical algorithm showed no difference for predicted 2-year survival and dyspnoea rates between the groups, but did predict for lower oesophageal toxicity with 4DCT plans (p=0.001). There was no correlation between LKB modelling and the clinical algorithm for lung toxicity or survival. Dose escalation was possible in 15/20 cases, with a mean increase in dose by a factor of 1.19 (10.45 Gy) using 4DCT compared with 3DCT plans. (Cole et al., 2014)\n4DCT can theoretically improve therapeutic ratio and dose escalation based on dosimetric parameters and mathematical modelling. However, when individual characteristics are incorporated, this gain may be less evident in terms of survival and dyspnoea rates.\n4DCT allows potential for isotoxic dose escalation, which may lead to improved local control and better overall survival. (Cole et al., 2014)\nMean follow-up times in the 4DCT/IMRT and CT/3DCRT groups were 1.3 (range, 0.1–3.2) and 2.1 (range, 0.1–7.9) years, respectively. The hazard ratios for 4DCT/IMRT were <1 for all disease end points; the difference was significant only for OS. The toxicity rate was significantly lower in the IMRT/4DCT group than in the CT/ 3DCRT group. V was significantly higher in the 3DCRT group and was a significant factor\nin determining toxicity. Freedom from DM was nearly identical in both groups. (Liao et al., 2010)\nTreatment with 4DCT/IMRT was at least as good as that with 3DCRT in terms of the rates of freedom from locoregional progression (LRP) and distant metastasis (DM). There was a significant reduction in toxicity and a significant improvement in OS. (Liao et al., 2010)",

(NICE, 2011)\nThe European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) (Vansteenkiste et al., 2013) recommends the use of accelerated radiotherapy (e.g. 66Gy in 24 fractions) based on the results of a meta-analysis conducted by Maugen et al. (2012). The meta-analysis included individual patient data from phase III trials, it found that modified fractionation improved OS as compared with conventional schedules (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.88, 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.97; p=.009), resulting in an absolute benefit of 2.5% (8.3% to 10.8%) at 5 years. In both NSCLC and SCLC, the use of modified radiotherapy increased the risk of acute oesophageal toxicity (odds ratio [OR] = 2.44 in NSCLC and OR = 2.41 in SCLC; p<.001) but did not have an impact on the risk of other acute toxicities. The study concluded that patients with nonmetastatic NSCLC derived a significant OS benefit from accelerated or hyperfractionated radiotherapy; a similar but non-significant trend was observed for SCLC.\nThe Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) looked at hyperfractionated and/or accelerated radiotherapy in stage III NSCLC. They identified a meta-analysis and two RCTs (Lung Cancer Disease Group, 2000, Sause et al., 2000, Saunders et al., 1999) that suggest a survival benefit for accelerated and hyperfractionated radical radiation therapy compared with conventional radiotherapy. No benefit was observed for hyperfractionated radical radiation therapy of standard time length over conventional radiotherapy (SIGN, 2014).\nSaunders et al.

(SIGN, 2014)\nWhen planning radical radiotherapy to the thorax it is crucial to take into account the dose delivered to the normal lung tissue, oesophagus, spinal cord and heart. In order to ensure the maximum sparing of normal tissues, three-dimensional treatment planning is mandatory (Senan et al., 2004). However, defining limits of dose tolerated by these tissues is complex as these limits vary according to the total dose delivered, fractionation regimen and use of concurrent chemotherapy (Milano et al., 2007, Schultheiss et al., 1995, van Baardwijk et al., 2008a, van Baardwijk et al., 2008b). The risk of developing radiotherapy- induced lung toxicity can be estimated by calculating the dose-volume histogram of the lungs, including V and mean lung dose (MLD) (Graham et al., 1999, Kwa et al., 1998). (Lim et al., 2010)\nThe greatest limitation of thoracic radiotherapy is radiotherapy induced lung toxicity (Graham et al., 1999, Kwa et al., 1998, Roach et al., 1995, Gandara et al., 2003). Radiotherapy planning parameters such as V and MLD are effective tools for predicting radiation pneumonitis (Graham et al., 1999, Kwa et al.,\nAccording to the Quantitative Analyses of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC) lung-specific paper (Marks et al., 2010) it is prudent to limit V to ≤30–35% and mean lung dose to ≤20–23 Gy (with\nconventional fractionation) if one wants to limit the risk of radiation pneumonitis to ≤20% in definitively treated patients with non–small cell lung cancer.\nCole et al. (2014) investigated the potential dosimetric and clinical benefits predicted by using four- dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) compared with 3DCT in the planning of radical radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer.\nTwenty patients were planned using free breathing 4DCT then retrospectively delineated on three- dimensional helical scan sets (3DCT). Beam arrangement and total dose (55 Gy in 20 fractions) were matched for 3D and 4D plans. Plans were compared for differences in planning target volume (PTV) geometrics and NTCP for organs at risk using dose volume histograms. Tumour control probability and NTCP were modelled using the Lyman–Kutcher–Burman (LKB) model. This was compared with a predictive clinical algorithm (Maastro), which is based on patient characteristics, including: age, performance status, smoking history, lung function, tumour staging and concomitant chemotherapy, to predict survival and toxicity outcomes. Potential therapeutic gains were investigated by applying isotoxic dose escalation to both plans using constraints for MLD (18 Gy), oesophageal maximum (70 Gy) and spinal cord maximum (48 Gy). (Cole et al., 2014)\nIn addition to oesophageal dosimetry, the use of concurrent delivery of chemotherapy has been shown to increase toxicity rates (Belderbos et al., 2005, Auperin et al., 2010). (Cole et al., 2014)\nRadiation pneumonitis is an important consideration for patients with lung cancer, particularly for those with already compromised respiratory function (Wang et al., 2002). This potentially life-threatening complication is generally experienced in the first months after treatment. Established theoretical models to predict the risk of pneumonitis include MLD or the volume of lung receiving more than a threshold dose (e.g. V ) (Kwa et al., 1998, Fay et al., 2005). Predicted rates for lung toxicity in this group were 22%\nless for the 4D group. When specific tumour and patient characteristics were combined with dosimetric parameters, this apparent improvement was not seen. This suggests that despite close attention to dose constraints and dose volume histogram (DVH) characteristics, clinical factors may have a larger impact on pneumonitis risks and outweigh any improvements that 4DCT may convey on an individual basis. (Cole et al., 2014)\nTreatment with 4DCT/IMRT was at least as good as that with 3DCRT in terms of the rates of freedom from locoregional progression (LRP) and distant metastasis (DM). There was a significant reduction in toxicity and a significant improvement in OS (Liao et al., 2010).",

The PORT Meta-analysis Trialists Group undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available evidence from randomised trials.\nUpdated data were obtained on individual patients from all available randomised trials of postoperative radiotherapy versus surgery alone. Data on 2128 patients from nine randomised trials (published and unpublished) were analysed by intention to treat. Median follow-up was 3.9 years (2.3–9.8 for individual trials) for surviving patients. The results show a significant adverse effect of postoperative radiotherapy on survival (HR 1.21 [95% CI 1.08–1.34]). Subgroup analyses suggest that this adverse effect was greatest for patients with stage I/II, N0–N1 disease, whereas for those with stage III, N2 disease there was no clear evidence of an adverse effect. The authors concluded that postoperative radiotherapy is detrimental to patients with early-stage completely resected NSCLC and should not be used routinely for such patients. The role of postoperative radiotherapy in the treatment of N2 tumours is not clear and may warrant further research. (PORT Meta-analysis Trialists Group, 1998)\nb) Any pN, R1, R2 resection\nThe role of PORT in patients with a positive resection margin (R1 resection) is unknown as there are no randomised trials examining the role of radiotherapy in this group of patients (Wind et al., 2007, Jassem, 2007). PORT is often given in routine practice if pathological examination shows tumour at the resection margin on the basis of retrospective series showing a reduction in the local recurrence rates following PORT (Massard et al., 2000, Kimura and Yamaguchi, 1994, Ghiribelli et al., 1999, Gebitekin et al., 1994, Heikkila et al., 1986) or an excess of local recurrence rates without PORT (Snijder et al., 1998). However, some retrospective series have shown high local recurrence rates despite the use of PORT (Gebitekin et al., 1994, Snijder et al., 1998). It should also be noted that a retrospective study showed an adverse impact of radiotherapy on survival in patients irradiated for positive margins (Massard et al., 2000). (Lim et al., 2010)\nA literature review on this topic suggested that patients with stage I and II disease and positive margins are more likely to benefit from PORT than patients with stage III disease (Wind et al., 2007). Indeed, survival of patients with stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer and an R1 resection of the bronchial resection margin is significantly worse compared with the stage corrected survival after radical surgery (Liewald et al., 1992). The potential benefit of this treatment in terms of reduction of the risk of local recurrence rate has to be weighed carefully against the risk of morbidity and mortality related to PORT. (Lim et al., 2010)\nThe optimal dose/fractionation for PORT is not known, but modern studies suggest that a dose in the range of 50-55 Gy using conventional fractionation should be used (Trodella et al., 2002, Bogart and Aronowitz, 2005). There are few randomised data investigating the benefit of PORT and its optimal sequencing in the context of adjuvant chemotherapy. In adjuvant chemotherapy trials allowing the use of PORT, the radiotherapy was delivered after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy and did not seem\nto offset the beneficial effect of adjuvant chemotherapy (Douillard et al., 2006, Arriagada et al., 2004, Scagliotti et al., 2003).

In patients who received PCI, the 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year overall survival rates were 42%, 19%, and 9%, respectively (p<0.001). The cause-specific survival rate at 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years was 28%, 15%, 11%, respectively, in patients who did not receive PCI and 45%, 24%, 17%, respectively, in patients who did receive PCI (p<0.001). On multivariate analysis of cause-specific and overall survival, age at diagnosis, sex, grade, extent of primary disease, size of disease, extent of lymph node involvement, and PCI were found to be significant (p<0.001). Significantly improved overall and cause-specific survival was observed in patients treated with prophylactic cranial irradiation on unadjusted and adjusted analyses. This study concurs with the previously published European experience. PCI should be considered for patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer.\nThe optimum dose of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is unknown. A randomised clinical trial (Le Pechoux et al., 2009) compared the effect of standard versus higher PCI doses on the incidence of brain metastases. Seven hundred and twenty patients with limited- stage SCLC in complete remission after chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy from 157 centres in 22 countries were randomly assigned to a standard (n=360, 25 Gy in 10 daily fractions of 2.5 Gy) or higher PCI total dose (n=360, 36 Gy) delivered using either conventional (18 daily fractions of 2 Gy) or accelerated hyperfractionated (24 fractions in 16 days with two daily sessions of 1.5 Gy separated by a minimum interval of 6 h) radiotherapy. After a median follow-up of 39 months (range 0–89 months), 145 patients had brain metastases; 82 in the standard-dose group and 63 in the higher-dose group.\nThere was no significant difference in the 2-year incidence of brain metastases between the standard PCI dose group and the higher-dose group, at 29% (95% CI 24–35) and 23% (18–29), respectively (HR 0.80 [95% CI 0.57–1.11], p=0.18). Two hundred and twenty six patients in the standard-dose group and 252 in the higher-dose group died; 2-year overall survival was 42% (95% CI 37–48) in the standard-dose group and 37% (32–42) in the higher-dose group (HR 1.20 [1.00–1.44]; p=0.05). The authors concluded that no significant reduction in the total incidence of brain metastases was observed after higher-dose PCI, but there was a significant increase in mortality. PCI at 25 Gy should remain the standard of care in limited- stage SCLC. (Le Pechoux et al., 2009)",

It included 13 trials comparing chemotherapy alone to chemotherapy and thoracic RT totalling 2,140 patients, of which 433 were excluded as they had extensive disease. 1,862 of the 2,103 patients who could be evaluated died; the median follow-up of the surviving patients was 43 months.

There was\na 5.4% benefit in terms of overall survival at three years for the combined therapy group. The authors concluded that thoracic RT moderately improves survival in patients with limited SCLC who are treated with combination chemotherapy.\nThere is controversy regarding the optimal timing of thoracic radiotherapy, with some meta-analysis suggesting a small OS benefit of early delivery concomitantly to chemotherapy. However, this is associated with an increase in treatment related toxicity (Lu et al., 2014, Spiro et al., 2006, Pijls-Johannesma et al., 2005, Huncharek and McGarry, 2004, Fried et al., 2004).",

Patients were randomly assigned to undergo PCI or to receive no further therapy. The primary end point was the time to symptomatic brain metastases. CT scanning or MRI of the brain was performed when any predefined key symptom suggestive of brain metastases was present, but was not done routinely prior to PCI. The two groups (each with 143 patients) were well balanced regarding baseline characteristics. The cumulative risk of brain metastases within 1 year was 14.6% in the PCI group and 40.4% in the control group (HR 0.27; p<0.001). PCI was associated with an increase in median overall survival from 5.4 to 6.7 months after randomisation. The 1-year survival rate was 27.1% in the PCI group and 13.3% in the control group (p=0.003). PCI had side effects but did not have a clinically significant effect on global health status. The largest mean difference between the two arms was observed in fatigue and hair loss, which were greater in those who received PCI (Slotman et al., 2009). PCI reduced the incidence of symptomatic brain metastases and prolonged overall survival in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (Slotman et al., 2007).",

      "text": "Most patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer who undergo chemotherapy, and prophylactic cranial irradiation, have persistent intrathoracic disease. Slotman et al. (2015) assessed thoracic radiotherapy for treatment of this patient group.\nA phase III randomised controlled trial at 42 hospitals: 16 in Netherlands, 22 in the UK, three in Norway, and one in Belgium, enrolled patients with WHO performance score 0–2 and confirmed extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer who responded to chemotherapy. Four hundred and ninety-eight patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either thoracic radiotherapy (30 Gy in ten fractions) or no thoracic radiotherapy. All underwent prophylactic cranial irradiation. Three withdrew informed consent, leaving 247 patients in the thoracic radiotherapy group and 248 in the control group.\nMean interval between diagnosis and randomisation was 17 weeks. Median follow-up was 24 months. Overall survival at 1 year was not significantly different between groups: 33% (95% CI 27–39) for the thoracic radiotherapy group versus 28% (95% CI 22–34) for the control group (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69–1.01; p=0.066). However, in a secondary analysis, 2-year overall survival was 13% (95% CI 9–19) versus 3% (95% CI 2–8; p=0.004). Progression was less likely in the thoracic radiotherapy group than in the control group (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61–0.87; p=0.001). At 6 months, progression-free survival was 24% (95% CI 19– 30) versus 7% (95% CI 4–11; p=0.001). No severe toxic effects were recorded. The most common grade 3 or higher toxic effects were fatigue (11 vs 9) and dyspnoea (three vs four). (Slotman et al., 2015)\nThe authors concluded that thoracic radiotherapy in addition to prophylactic cranial irradiation should be considered for all patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer who respond to chemotherapy. (Slotman et al., 2015)\nThis is supported by a recent meta-analysis (Palma et al., 2016) that combined the RCT detailed above (Slotman et al., 2015) with an older RCT (Jeremic et al., 1999). Palma et al. (2016) examined the role of thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) in patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer. Overall, the delivery of TRT was associated with improved overall survival (HR 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.96; p=.014) and progression-free survival (HR 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.87, p<.001). Bronchopulmonary toxicity (grade 3 or higher) was similar in both groups (≤2%). Oesophageal toxicity (grade 3 or higher) was 6.6% in the TRT arm and 0% in the non-TRT arm (p<.001). The study concluded that TRT improves overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer, with a small incremental risk of oesophageal toxicity. Future randomised trials to identify possible survival benefits of TRT dose escalation in patients with extensive- stage small-cell lung cancer would assist clinicians in selecting the optimal dose while minimising oesophageal toxicity.",

Patients assigned to early palliative care had a better quality of life than patients assigned to standard care (mean score on the FACT-L scale [in which scores range from 0 to 136, with higher scores indicating better quality of life], 98.0 vs. 91.5; p=0.03). In addition, fewer patients in the palliative care group than in the standard care group had depressive symptoms (16% vs. 38%, p=0.01). Despite the fact that fewer patients in the early palliative care group than in the standard care group received aggressive end-of-life care (33% vs. 54%, p=0.05), median survival was longer among patients receiving early palliative care (11.6 months vs. 8.9 months, p=0.02). While a survival benefit from early involvement of palliative care has not yet been demonstrated in other oncology settings, substantial evidence demonstrates that palliative care when combined with standard cancer care or as the main focus of care leads to better patient and caregiver outcomes. These include improvement in symptoms, QOL, and patient satisfaction, with reduced caregiver burden. Earlier involvement of palliative care also leads to more appropriate referral to and use of hospice, and reduced use of futile intensive care. While evidence clarifying optimal delivery of palliative care to improve patient outcomes is evolving, no trials to date have demonstrated harm to patients and caregivers, or excessive costs, from early involvement of palliative care.

The majority of patients will require diagnostic tests (radiology, pathology) and depending on the treatment plan may require surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\nA population-based cost analysis (Luengo-Fernandez et al., 2013) illustrated the economic burden of cancer on the European Union (EU). In 2009, cancer is estimated to have cost the EU €126 billion, with healthcare costs accounting for €51 billion (40%). They found that lung cancer had the highest economic\ncost (€18.8 billion, 15% of overall cancer costs), followed by breast cancer (€15.0 billion, 12%), colorectal cancer (€13.1 billion, 10%), and prostate cancer (€8.43 billion, 7%).\nInpatient care was the major component of health-care costs in lung cancer (€2.87 billion, 68%). The highest productivity losses attributable to mortality were identified for lung cancer (€9.92 billion; 23% of the €42.6 billion in productivity losses because of all cancers). The costs of informal care were also highest for patients with lung cancer (€3.82 billion; 16% of the €23.2 billion total informal care provided). With lung cancer incidence expected to increase by 136% in females (Nordpred model) and 52% in males (NCRI, 2014), there could be a significant increase seen in healthcare costs per person in Ireland.\nMost of the recommendations in this guideline represent current standard practice and are therefore cost neutral. However, the GDG have identified areas that require change in practice to ensure full implementation of the guideline. The potential resource implications of applying these recommendations have been considered (Appendix 6: Budget Impact Assessment). However, it is important to note that the cost effectiveness analysis and the budget impact analysis are carried out separately from the generation of clinical recommendations. The methodology applied is documented in Section 3.8 Methodology and literature review. For areas where additional resources are required to implement the guideline the resources required will be sought through the HSE service planning process.",

The NCCP has developed general practitioner (GP) referral guidelines, standardised GP referral forms, and GP electronic referral for patients with lung cancer. The NCCP in partnership with the Irish Cancer Society has commenced a cancer survivorship programme. The main goal for the NCCP Survivorship Programme is to empower patients to achieve their best possible health while living with and beyond a diagnosis of cancer. This involves providing information, guidance and support to survivors and their families and healthcare\nprofessionals in relation to healthy lifestyle, disease prevention and control. It aims to promote a good quality of life and prolonged survival for people who experience cancer.\nThe NCCP has also a Lung National Clinical Leads Network with defined terms of reference. The output of this network includes the following: • Development and agreement of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), • Organising annual multidisciplinary Cancer Quality and Audit Fora, • Focus on cancer specific issues such as the development of information resources for patients and health professionals.\nPatient information booklets/leaflets covering various aspects of the cancer journey are available on the NCCP website.",

The literature was updated prior to publication. This necessitated a complete review and rewrite of the medical oncology section in July 2016. This is a live document, updates and reviews are carried out at three year intervals.\nA literature search for the budget impact assessment was performed using the SIGN economic filter (Table 11.

Each recommendation was assigned a grade by the GDG. The grade reflected the level of evidence upon which the recommendations were based, the directness of the evidence, and whether further research is likely to change the recommendation.

      "text": "The Guideline Development Group (GDG) undertook a literature search for evidence of clinical- and cost- effectiveness, cost and resource impact, including primary (research studies) and secondary (reviews) sources. The literature sources searched are specified in the literature search strategy and include relevant resources, such as trial/guideline registries and relevant citation databases. The economic literature review was undertaken using the same search terms as derived from the clinical literature review (available as a separate document) but with an economic filter applied. The results of this search were then refined by focusing on studies carried out in countries where the population, costs and treatment were considered similar to the Irish setting. All papers included (Figure 9) were subject to appraisal using the SIGN ‘Economic Evaluations: Methodology Checklist 6’ by a health economist and are deemed of acceptable quality unless otherwise stated.\nBudget impact of this National Clinical Guideline\nFor recommendations which affect resource requirements, the budget impact was calculated. Additional resources, where required, will be sought through the HSE service planning process.\nThe burden of cancer is growing, and the disease is becoming a major economic expenditure for all developed countries. In 2008, the worldwide cost of cancer due to premature death and disability (not including direct medical costs) was estimated to be US$895 billion. This is not simply due to an increase in absolute numbers, but also the rate of increase of expenditure on cancer. Several drivers of cost, such as over-use, rapid expansion, and shortening life cycles of cancer technologies (such as medicines and imaging modalities), and the lack of suitable clinical research and integrated health economic studies, have converged with more defensive medical practice, a less informed regulatory system and a lack of evidence-based sociopolitical debate. (Sullivan et al., 2011)\n“The cancer profession and industry should take responsibility and not accept a substandard evidence- base and an ethos of very small benefit at whatever cost.” (Sullivan et al., 2011) Sullivan et al. (2011) believe that value and affordable cancer care can be introduced into the cancer policy lexicon without detracting from quality, and that the management tools, evidence, and methods are available to affect this transformation across all developed countries.\nA population-based cost analysis (Luengo-Fernandez et al., 2013) illustrated the economic burden of cancer on the European Union (EU). In 2009, cancer was estimated to have cost the EU €126 billion, with healthcare costs accounting for €51 billion (40%). In Ireland, inpatient care costs were estimated to account for €417 million of cancer-related healthcare costs out of a total of €619 million. Drug expenditure accounted for a further €127 million, while primary, outpatient and emergency care were estimated at €32 million, €30 million and €13 million, respectively. Across the EU, lung cancer had the highest economic cost (€18.8 billion) when compared to breast (€15 billion), colorectal (€13.1 billion) and prostate (€8.43 billion) cancer. The cost of lung cancer related productivity losses and informal care were estimated at €9.92 billion and €3.82 billion, respectively (Luengo-Fernandez et al., 2013). Irish healthcare costs for the treatment of lung cancer were estimated to cost €13 per person (Luengo-Fernandez et al., 2013). In comparison the European average cost per person for the treatment of lung cancer was\nestimated to be €8. With cancer incidence expected to increase by 99% by 2040 (NCRI, 2014), there could be a significant increase seen in healthcare costs per person in Ireland.",

      "text": "The search strategy for economic literature is based on the search used in the clinical literature review, with the addition of a SIGN economic studies filter for Medline (Table 11. Economic literature review protocol) including the former Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (EED), Health Technology Assessment Database, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar.\nThe estimated costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) or life years gained (LYG) given in the following summaries are those reported within each study for the given year and national currency. These cost- effectiveness ratios have been complemented in brackets by euro estimates to correct for the exchange rate, purchasing power parity (PPP) between countries and health inflation to 2014 costs as per the Health Information and Quality Authority’s Economic Evaluation Guidelines (HIQA, 2014).\nThe following summaries report the conclusions regarding cost-effectiveness made by the authors of the reviewed literature. It is important to recognise that those conclusions are particular to the health systems in the countries in which the studies are conducted in and reflect medical practice and healthcare costs at the time the studies were undertaken. These practices and costs can differ significantly between countries, even between nations of comparable per capita income. Clearly current medical practice in Ireland may differ from the context of the original studies and care must be taken not to over-interpret the relevance of such evidence for Ireland. More specifically, it is important to note that cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) results can be highly contingent on what particular practices are compared and in what way. The conclusion that a given intervention is cost-effective in one setting may not hold true for another if the baseline standard of care against which that intervention is assessed differs between the two settings.\nAnother reason for conclusions on cost-effectiveness to differ between countries relates to the prevailing cost-effectiveness threshold. While Ireland has no explicit cost-effectiveness threshold for non-drug interventions, cost-effectiveness ratios falling within the region of €45,000/QALY are conventionally considered cost-effective in Ireland. As this threshold differs from the thresholds typically used in other countries the statements of cost-effectiveness made in other contexts are not necessarily applicable to Ireland. In all cases possible the relevant Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) have been reported, thereby permitting comparison to the Irish threshold rather than relying on the original conclusion of each study relative to any national norms of cost-effectiveness in each case. It should be noted that there are constraints regarding cost-utility and heterogeneity of practice.\nThe reported costs and cost-effectiveness ratios have been inflated to 2014 euro values and adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). Nevertheless, it is also important to remember that there may still be a number of other factors which mean that cost-effectiveness ratios from other countries are not necessarily directly applicable to the Irish setting. For example, Ireland’s discount rate is higher than that applied in the UK, so many interventions assessed in the UK would have less favourable ratios if the Irish discount rate was applied. Similarly, some analyses are conducted from the societal perspective and may account for more costs and benefits than are considered in Irish cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs), which only account for costs to the health sector and do not typically include non-health benefits. Accordingly, the euro-adjusted ratios reported here should only be considered broadly indicative of the level of cost- effectiveness rather than precisely adjusted estimates for the Irish health system.\nFinally, it should be noted that there is very little available literature on the cost-effectiveness of the interventions considered here. In most cases there is only one study per indication. This presents a considerable challenge in reaching conclusions regarding the likely cost-effectiveness of the interventions\nin question. It would be preferable to have a range of studies to compare in order to better judge evidence quality and to provide insight into the effects of methodological and empirical factors from each study on the conclusions reached. However, the absence of a rich evidence base means that health economic evidence should be considered tentatively and the findings should only be considered broadly indicative of what might apply in Ireland currently.",

In light of that the budget impact and pharmacoeconomic assessment for this guideline defers to that process.\nThe existing reimbursement process for new cancer drugs or new indications for existing cancer drugs is: The Department of Health agreed a pricing and reimbursement framework agreement with the Pharmaceutical industry, the 2012 IPHA agreement. That has been further enhanced by the enactment and commencement of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, and the 2016 IPHA agreement.\nIn the agreement, the Department of Health agreed processes with the pharmaceutical industry with clearly documented procedures and timelines for the assessment of new medicines (IPHA agreement) in as timely a fashion as possible. The Health Act places statutory responsibilities on the HSE in relation to pricing and reimbursement of medicines.\nThe HSE, in any considerations around pricing and reimbursement is required to follow the procedures outlined in the agreement and the Act.\nIn accordance with those procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducts Health Technology Assessments (HTA) which provide detailed information to the HSE on the potential budget impacts of the medicines and considers whether the medicines are cost effective at the current prices offered to the HSE.\nThe respective pharmaceutical companies submit dossiers to the NCPE which are examined in great detail in as short timeframes as possible. NCPE complete reports on the dossiers for the HSE and publishes its findings.\nThe NCPE reports are important inputs to assist decision making and are required to assist the HSE in ensuring that the most appropriate decisions are made.\nThe National Cancer Control Programme Technology Review Committee reviews proposals received from industry or expert groups in Ireland for funding of new cancer drugs, or expanded indications for existing cancer drugs or related predictive laboratory tests. Following appropriate deliberations, the Committee makes a recommendation on the introduction of the individual drug. When this is positive, the recommendation is then brought forward to the HSE Drugs Group for final decisions regarding funding.\nThe HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at decisions on the funding of each of the drugs that are clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. The HSE engages with each of the pharmaceutical companies to discuss the issues raised in the NCPE reports.\nThe Department of Health approves the annual HSE Service Plan which contains financial provisions for new medicines which the HSE is required to manage to the best of its ability so as to provide access to as wide a range of new medicines as possible in a clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable manner.\nPotentially relevant citations identified through literature search (n=237)\nExcluded citations (n=212)\nCitations retrieved for a more detailed evaluation (n=25)\nStudies included for review and appraisal by health economist (n=8)\nEconomic literature review results breakdown Figure 9.",

(2012) presents a systematic review of the use of positron emission tomography (PET) in the staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the management of solitary pulmonary nodules. Their overall conclusion is that although the evidence appears mixed, it seems PET is either cost-saving or cost- effective relative to other intervention strategies.\nThe analysis searched four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, NHS EED, and the Cochrane Health Technology Assessment Database) for literature on the cost-effectiveness of PET imaging. The authors assessed the identified studies against health economic analysis quality checklist and only included those studies with high scores in the primary analysis. In all, they identified 18 studies for review. Data including costs and effects were extracted from the studies and assessed. They also extracted the principal conclusion from each analysis. The review goes on to consider a number of other studies that are apparently considered relevant in the literature, but were either excluded due to low quality scores or not captured by the literature search.\nThe review notes that all of the analyses used decision analytic modelling to reach their findings. The review notes that results of the analyses are therefore contingent on the modelling assumptions made. It notes the heterogeneity of key assumptions regarding the test performance. The review draws particular attention to the number of studies interpreting the cost-effectiveness results incorrectly, primarily due to inappropriate comparisons between strategies. To correct for this they present revised interpretations of the cost-effectiveness ratios based on the reported costs and effects. It is important to note that there is great variety in the strategies compared, with different combinations of computed tomography and PET being considered. Despite this, the results show that strategies featuring PET are generally either cost-saving or have ICERs that are likely to be well within acceptable limits of cost-effectiveness. When the review considers the finding of other studies not captured by the search strategy, these other studies generally support the conclusion that PET imaging is either cost-saving or cost-effective.\nThe review process is well described and the abstracting of data and correcting of erroneously interpreted cost-effectiveness ratios are all strengths of this review. However, despite implementing a clearly described search strategy, this analysis also goes on to review a large number of studies that were not captured by the search string, which seems counter to the purpose of the systematic review. A further note of caution is that while the review indicates that PET imaging can be cost-saving or cost- effective, the results also show that PET imaging is not necessarily always cost-effective, as it depends on what particular combination of imaging is assessed. An additional caveat is that although the review by Cao et al. (2012) itself is relatively recent, the studies considered within the review date back to between 1996 and 2007. So the relevance of the findings to current clinical practice and service provision costs may now be limited. In conclusion, the overall finding from this review should be interpreted as a heavily qualified endorsement of PET imaging as likely to be a rational strategy.\nCost-effectiveness of initial diagnostic strategy for pulmonary nodules presenting to thoracic surgeons\nDeppen et al. (2014) present a cost-effectiveness model to examine the cost-effectiveness of computer assisted navigational bronchoscopy (NB) as an alternative to positron emission tomography (PET) as a diagnostic tool for patients with lung nodules. Their results suggest that NB is a cost-effective alternative to PET, although the differences in costs and effects appear relatively small.\nThe analysis uses a model to compare four diagnostic strategies: the current strategy of PET imaging; NB; computed tomogaphy guided fine needle aspiration (CT-FNA); and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical biopsy (VATS). VATS is used as follow-up diagnostic procedure in all strategies in which VATS is not the first test when the initial test fails to yield a diagnostic result. The principal analysis is conducted for nodules of between 1.5 and 2 cm in size and has a suspected lung cancer risk of 65% according to standard risk models in a 60 year old man with a history of smoking.\nThe results of the analysis find NB, CT-FNA and VATS all to be more costly and more effective than PET. NB and CT-FNA are found to be effectively equal in terms of costs and effects. VATS is dominated by NB and CT-FNA. The cost-effectiveness ratio of NB relative to PET is reported as $4,600/QALY (€3,945/QALY in 2014 in inflation and PPP adjusted euro). Accordingly, NB would be interpreted as a highly cost-effective intervention as its ICER is well within commonly applied thresholds, such as the €45,000/QALY threshold applied in Ireland. The NB strategy only provides 0.05 more QALYs than the baseline PET strategy and the increase in costs of approximately $200 is less than 2% higher.\nThe analysis is reasonably well described, but there is more detail in the model description and results that would have been beneficial. In particular, the analysis does not present many of the intermediary estimates such as the numbers of cases detected or numbers of false positives from the model, accordingly, it is not clear by what means the improved diagnostic performance leads to improved health outcomes. The analysis also did not apply discounting, which would have been appropriate in this case. While it seems unlikely that the application of discounting would result in the primary ICER estimate becoming greater than commonly applied cost-effectiveness thresholds, the failure to apply discounting is a concern as it signals methodological weakness. Similarly, the ICERs for dominated strategies are not reported correctly. Finally, the specific analysis to a given nodule size and estimated cancer risk means that it is unclear how the results presented here would apply to other cases more generally. Overall, while this study indicates NB is a cost-effective alternative to PET more evidence from other studies would be desirable.\nClinical effectiveness and cost-effectivenss of the diagnostic staging strategy of EBUS-TBNA combined with EUS-FNA compared with standard surgical staging techniques\nSharples et al. (2012) present a cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative diagnostic procedures for NSCLC as part of a broader clinical comparison of combined endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) as an alternative to conventional surgical diagnostic technique of mediastinoscopy. They find combined EUS- FNA EBUS-TBNA (endosonography) to have lower expected costs and higher expected effectiveness than mediastinoscopy, but do not find either of these results to be significantly different from zero.\nThe analysis is based on a randomised control trial (RCT) of the two approaches at four sites which followed patients for six months. The results of the RCT are combined with quality of life data gathered within the study in a Bayesian cost-effectiveness analysis of the data that permits an examination of uncertainty in the findings.\nThe analysis notes that the principal differences in costs arise due to both differences in the costs of the diagnostic procedure and differences in number of thoracotomies performed. The diagnostic costs were higher in the endosonography group, but this was partly offset by lower costs for thoracotomies. The resulting expected cost-effectiveness estimates find that endosonography dominates mediastinoscopy, but that the credible intervals for both incremental costs and effects estimates both cross zero.\nThis is a high quality study that is based on RCT evidence and directly elicited quality of life measures. The analysis is well documented and the results are clearly reported. The insignificant difference in costs and effects means it is difficult to strongly conclude in favour of endosonography. However, the conventional\napproach within cost-effectiveness is to base recommendations on expected values, therefore on this basis endosonography is the preferred strategy. Nevertheless, the differences in expected costs and QALYs between the two strategies are relatively small.",

This is relevant to recommendations 2.2.1.4 and 2.2.2.1 which discuss the clinical effectiveness of PET-CT as part of the clinical pathway.\nEUS-FNA combined with EBUS-TBNA is reported to have higher sensitivity and negative predictive probability, and so is expected to be slightly more effective and less expensive than using surgical staging alone.

      "text": "Cost associated with lobectomy performed thoracoscopically or via thoracotomy\nBurfeind Jr et al. (2010) conduct a cost-utility analysis comparing the two surgical methods for lobectomy. The conventional procedure is to use posterolateral thoracotomy (PLT), while the alternative is using thoracoscopy (TL). Their principal finding is that TL results in no less QALYs than PLT, but has statistically significantly reduced costs. Accordingly, the authors conclude that TL is a cost-saving procedure relative to standard PLT.\nThe analysis is primarily an observational analysis of 113 patients treated with either TL or PLT at a US medical centre between 2002 and 2004. The authors record the costs of surgery, including pre- and post-operative care for up to 30 days following the operation. The costs recorded are those incurred by the healthcare provider and relate to the direct use of resources. Patients completed quality of life questionnaires at four time points: preoperative, and 3, 6 and 12 month postoperatively to determine the differences in health related quality of life over a year following the operation. The procedures are considered equivalent in terms of overall survival from cancer, so there are no long term differences assumed for the costs of each intervention after the 30 days of observation. Discounting of costs and health effects was not applied because the differences in costs and effects of the procedures were only assessed over a short time span. Similarly, no adjustment is made for inflation. The analysis does not contain a sensitivity analysis as it is primarily an observational rather than a modelling study. It does clearly report error bounds on all the principal outcome measures reported.\nThe authors find no statistically significant difference in QALYs between the two procedures, hence they conclude them to be equally effective. They find the mean costs of PLT and TL to be $12,119 and $10,084 respectively (€17,700 and €14,700 respectively in 2014 in inflation and PPP adjusted euro). They find the difference between these two costs to be statistically significant, and so conclude that TL is cost- saving relative to PLT. The difference in costs between the interventions is largely attributed to lower pre- operative costs and reduced length of stay for the less invasive TL procedure.\nOverall this analysis appears well conducted and the conclusion that TL is cost-saving relative to PLT is credible. Nevertheless, there are some important limitations to this study that need to be recognised. The study does not feature randomisation between the two interventions. While this may raise concerns regarding the validity of the findings, it should also be noted that the study has demonstrated no difference in a range of patient characteristics between the intervention groups. More relevant to issues of external validity is the fact that the data for this study date from 2002 to 2004 and originate in the US, so the findings might not necessarily be representative of current care in Ireland. Notably, the quality of life measures employed failed to find a difference between the techniques, despite the finding of previous authors that TL is associated with reduced postoperative pain. This may be because the quality of life measure lacked sensitivity or was not employed at the relevant time point. However, this is not of great importance as it does not alter the conclusion that TL is a rational alternative to PLT given the evidence presented from this case.",

      "text": "Economic evaluation of first-line and maintenance treatments for advanced non-small cell lung cancer\nChouaïd et al. (2014) present a systematic review of cost-effectiveness analyses of treatments for non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall conclusion reached by the authors is that the available evidence shows that most modern treatments recommended or recently developed tend to have cost- effectiveness ratios that are in excess of what would currently be considered cost-effective.\nThis analysis systematically reviewed four databases (MEDLINE, NIHR Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, NHS HEED and PubMed). The search was run to assess the cost-effectiveness of first- line and maintenance therapy for NSCLC. A large number of treatment and treatment combinations are examined in the review. These include, cisplatin-pemetrexed, cisplatin-gemcitabine, carboplatin- paclitaxel, bevacizumab, cisplatin-vinorelbine, cisplatin-docetaxel, gemcitabine-vinorelbine, erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and crizotinib. While the review is systematically described, the data extraction and reporting are not. The results of the review are presented within the text rather than in tables. It broadly considers interventions with ICERs below $50,000/QALY (€46,200/QALY adjusted for inflation and PPP) to be cost-effective.\nThe report considers the reported costs and cost-effectiveness of the various treatment strategies, including alternative treatment combination used either in unselected patients or as targeted therapies. While the reporting is not consistent across the studies and a large number of ICERs are reported, most are in the hundreds of thousands of Euro or Dollars per QALY gained. Accordingly, these ICERs generally indicate that most of the therapies reviewed are not cost-effective.\nOverall this review does not appear to be of high quality. The unstructured reporting of results for many treatment combinations and patient subgroups does not present the relevant evidence in an accessible format. The lack of focus on any one particular therapy or patient subgroup means there is no clear message to report to decision makers. Furthermore, the review does not appear to critically appraise the reviewed studies or assess the validity of the reported ICERs. Consequently, some inappropriately interpreted cost-effectiveness ratios have been reported in the review (for example the ICERs reported from Handorf et al.). Despite this, the overall conclusion of the review that most recent treatments considered for NSCLC do not appear to be acceptably cost-effective appears broadly correct given the literature cited.",

      "text": "Cost-effectiveness analysis comparing conventional versus stereotactic body radiotherapy for surgically ineligible stage I NSCLC\nMitera et al. (2014) use a simple retrospective observational analysis to compare the costs and effects of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of stage I NSCLC. Their analysis indicates that SBRT is more costly and more effective than CFRT and has a cost-effectiveness ratio well within standard cost-effectiveness thresholds.\nThe analysis compares stage Ia and Ib NSCLC patients receiving CFRT or SBRT instead of surgical resection. The analysis is a retrospective analysis of costs and mortality of patients at a Canadian hospital. The analysis gives a detailed description of the costs captured in the analysis.\nThe results show that the patients receiving SBRT have mean survival of 3.8 years, while those receiving CFRT have a mean survival of 2.8 years. The analysis estimates that the costs of CFRT and SBRT are CAN$6,886 and CAN$8,042, respectively (€5,700 and €6,600 respectively in 2014 in inflation and PPP adjusted euro). The authors use these differences in costs and effects to report an ICER of CAN$1,120/LYG (€920/LYG). Accordingly, the low ICER estimate relative to commonly applied thresholds would suggest SBRT is a highly cost-effective alternative to CFRT.\nThe results of this study cannot be considered reliable, as it is unclear if the relatively large survival benefit of SBRT can be attributed to superior treatment effect or to differences in the patient characteristics between those receiving CFRT and SBRT. The introduction to the review itself notes that no randomised studies have demonstrated any difference between CFRT and SBRT. Furthermore, there are potentially relevant differences between the patient groups receiving each therapy, with more men and higher stage patients receiving CFRT than SBRT. No statistical testing is shown to examine the differences in the patient characteristics. Accordingly, the cost-effectiveness evidence presented in this study should be disregarded.\nComparison of surgical intervention and stereotactic body radiation therapy for stage I high-risk patients\nPuri et al. (2012) presents a model based cost-effectiveness comparison of surgical resection and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for high risk patients with stage I lung cancer. They conclude that while surgery is more costly than SBRT it is also more effective, supporting the cost-effectiveness of surgical resection rather than SBRT.\nThe analysis combines a retrospective analysis of high-risk patients receiving either surgery or SBRT with a simulation model. The observed recurrence rates from the observational study were adjusted using propensity score matching (PSM) with the aim of overcoming problems of selection bias between the two treatment groups. Using data from the PSM analysis they model the costs and effects of the two strategies. The effect estimates are not adjusted for quality of life, but rather are reported in life years gained (LYG). Costs and effects do not appear to be discounted.\nThe reported results show surgery to be somewhat more effective, with an expected LYG of 0.45. Surgery is found to be more costly too, with incremental costs of $3,476 (€3,200/LYG in 2014 in inflation and PPP adjusted euro) and the resulting ICER is $7,753/LYG (€7,200/LYG). This ICER is well within conventionally applied thresholds, such as the €45,000/QALY threshold commonly used in Ireland.\nOverall this is a well described study. The attempt to correct for selection bias using PSM is appropriate and the discussion gives a clear description of the possible limitations of this method. The principal potential problem is that SBRT candidates are expected to have greater morbidity than those allocated to surgery\nand PSM may not be fully able to correct for this. The lack of discounting is a notable methodological flaw and means the reported ICER is likely to be somewhat of an underestimate. However, given the relatively short amount of remaining life expectancy in most cases it is not likely that the discounted ICER would be so much higher as to rise above commonly applied thresholds. The study authors recognise the limits of the study design employed and suggest that prospective randomised studies are required to enhance confidence in the results reached. In conclusion, this report provides evidence of moderate quality supporting the cost-effectiveness of surgical resection rather than SBRT in high risk stage I lung cancer patients.\nCost-effectiveness analysis comparing conventionally fractionated radiotherapy versus stereotactic body radiotherapy for stage I NSCLC\nSher et al. (2011) presents a CEA of three alternative therapies for patients with early stage NSCLC not suitable for surgery. The analysis relates to peripheral tumours rather than those in the proximal bronchial tree. They compare radiofrequency ablation (RFA), three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). They found 3D-CRT to be subject to extended dominance and SBRT to be the most costly and most effective, with a cost-effectiveness ratio relative to RFA that is within commonly applied thresholds.\nThe analysis employs a model to combine estimates from the literature on disease progression rates, costs, and health related quality of life related to the three strategies. Parameters that are particularly important to the model are local recurrence rates under each of the three therapies. The model gives particular consideration to adverse effects associated with the SBRT therapy. The analysis includes a detailed costing from the health payer perspective. The analysis also presents a range of sensitivity analyses.\nThe results show that RFA is the least costly and least effective treatment. 3D-CRT is more costly and more effective, but subject to extended dominance, meaning it will never be a preferred strategy from the cost-effectiveness perspective. SBRT is the most costly and most effective strategy. SBRT is estimated to yield an incremental QALY gain of over half a QALY relative to RFA, which is a large gain proportional to remaining life-expectancy in this case. The ICER of SBRT relative to RFA is $14,100/QALY (€12,500/QALY in 2014 in inflation and PPP adjusted euro). Accordingly, SBRT would clearly be considered cost-effective relative to the thresholds of $50,000/QALY applied in the US and €45,000/QALY commonly applied in Ireland. Sensitivity analyses never find 3D-CRT to be the preferred strategy and almost always find SBRT to be the preferred strategy.\nThis is a well presented study. The model is described adequately and the relevant costs and effects are accounted for. Discounting is applied appropriately. That 3D-CRT is dominated by other strategies is not reflected clearly in the paper and the reporting of an incorrect ICER for this strategy is one notable problem with the presentation of results but it does not affect the study’s conclusions. The base case results and sensitivity analysis all support the conclusion that SBRT is likely to be cost-effective. The analysis notes that 3D-CRT may be the preferred strategies for tumours in the centre of the chest, where SBRT is less well tolerated.",

The relationship of an attribute to the disease is examined by comparing the diseased and nondiseased with regard to how frequently the attribute is present or, if quantitative, the levels of the attribute, in each of the groups. (CEBM website)\nA group or series of case reports involving patients who were given similar Case Series treatment. Reports of case series usually contain detailed information about the individual patients. This includes demographic information (for example, age, gender, ethnic origin) and information on diagnosis, treatment, response to treatment, and follow-up after treatment. (CEBM website)\nThe analytic method of epidemiologic study in which subsets of a defined Cohort study population can be identified who are, have been, or in the future may be exposed or not exposed, or exposed in different degrees, to a factor or factors hypothesized to influence the probability of occurrence of a given disease or other outcome. The main feature of cohort study is observation of large numbers over a long period (commonly years) with comparison of incidence rates in groups that differ in exposure levels. (CEBM website)\nThe extent to which a variable or intervention measures what it is supposed Validity to measure or accomplishes what it is supposed to accomplish. The internal validity of a study refers to the integrity of the experimental design. The external validity of a study refers to the appropriateness by which its results can be applied to non-study patients or populations. (CEBM website)\nA systematic review may or may not include a meta-analysis, which is a Meta-analysis quantitative summary of the results. (CEBM website)\nAn epidemiological experiment in which subjects in a population are Randomised trial randomly allocated into groups, usually called study and control groups, to receive or not receive an experimental preventive or therapeutic procedure, maneuver, or intervention. The results are assessed by rigorous comparison of rates of disease, death, recovery, or other appropriate outcome in the study and control groups. (CEBM website)\nThe application of strategies that limit bias in the assembly, critical appraisal, Systematic review and synthesis of all relevant studies on a specific topic. Systematic reviews focus on peer-reviewed publications about a specific health problem and use rigorous, standardised methods for selecting and assessing articles. A systematic review may or may not include a meta-analysis, which is a quantitative summary of the results. (CEBM website)",

Validating cohort study with good reference standards” “ ”; or CDR tested within one clinical centre. 1b ** Absolute SpPins (specificity) and SnNouts (sensitivity)” “. 1c Systematic review (with homogeneity ) of Level >2 diagnostic studies. 2a * Exploratory cohort study with good reference standards; CDR after deviation, or validated only on 2b ** split-samples or databases. §§§ Systematic review (with homogeneity ) of 3b and better studies. 3a * Non-consecutive study; or without consistently applied reference standards. 3b Case-control study, poor or non-independent reference standard. 4 Expert opinion without explicit critical appraisal, or based on physiology, bench research or first 5 principles.\n* By homogeneity we mean a systematic review that is free of worrisome variations (heterogeneity) in the directions and degrees of results between individual studies. Not all systematic reviews with statistically significant heterogeneity need be worrisome, and not all worrisome heterogeneity need be statistically significant. As noted above, studies displaying worrisome heterogeneity should be tagged with a “-” at the end of their designated level. ” Clinical Decision Rule (these are algorithms or scoring systems that lead to a prognostic estimation or a diagnostic category). ** Validating studies test the quality of a specific diagnostic test, based on prior evidence. An exploratory study collects information and trawls the data (e.g. using a regression analysis) to find which factors are ‘significant’. ” “ ” Good reference standards are independent of the test, and applied blindly or objectively to applied to all patients. Poor reference standards are haphazardly applied, but still independent of the test. Use of a non-independent reference standard (where the ‘test’ is included in the ‘reference’, or where the ‘testing’ affects the ‘reference’) implies a level 4 study. ” “ An “Absolute SpPin” is a diagnostic finding whose Specificity is so high that a positive result rules-in the diagnosis. An “Absolute SnNout” is a diagnostic finding whose Sensitivity is so high that a negative result rules-out the diagnosis. §§§ Split-sample validation is achieved by collecting all the information in a single tranche, then artificially dividing this into “derivation” and “validation” samples.\nGrades of recommendations for diagnostic studies (Oxford CEBM, 2009) Table 14 Consistent level 1 studies. A Consistent level 2 or 3 studies; or B Extrapolations from level 1 studies. Level 4 studies; or C Extrapolations from level 2 or 3 studies. Level 5 evidence; or D Troublingly inconsistent or inconclusive studies of any level.\nExtrapolations are where data is used in a situation that has potentially clinically important differences than the original study situation.\nLevels of Evidence for interventional studies (SIGN grading system 1999-2012) Table 15 High quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a very low risk of bias. 1++ Well conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews, or RCTs with a low risk of bias. 1+ Meta-analyses, systematic reviews, or RCTs with a high risk of bias. 1- High quality systematic reviews of case control or cohort studies. 2++ High quality case control or cohort studies with a very low risk of confounding or bias and a high probability that the relationship is causal.
