En innovation der anerkendes af EMA, der tilkendte Sotorasib en konditionel marketingsautorisation grundet det betydelige unmet need som Sotorasib adresserer. Vi er derfor overordnet tilfredse med at medicinrådet vurderer, at de anvendte studier afspejler dansk klinisk praksis, samt at de anvendte metoder muliggør en sundhedsøkonomisk evaluering.\nDer er dog forhold i denne vurderingsrapport, som Amgen ønsker at benytte muligheden for at kommentere på:",

Dette på trods af, at sammenlignende tabeller over disse var udarbejdet og vedlagt ansøgningsmaterialet, samt at det er muligt at inkludere disse i den sundhedsøkonomiske model. I denne konkrete sag er det vanskeligt at vurdere om uønskede hændelser forårsages af Sotorasib i Codebreak 100, eller om de forårsages af tidligere behandlingslinjer, hvilket også kommenteres i rapporten. Det kunne have været yderligere belyst, hvis der også var taget stilling til uønskede bivirkninger.\nSotorasib forårsager færre uønskede bivirkninger af grad 3+ i Codebreak 100 (20,6%) sammenlignet med Docetaxel i SELECT-1 (30%) på trods af, at patienter i Codebreak 100 var på aktiv behandling i mere end dobbelt så lang tid som i SELECT-1, havde modtaget flere tidligere behandlingslinjer, og patienter i SELECT-1 har bedre performance score end patienterne i Codebreak 100. Vi er opmærksomme på, at en sammenligning af uønskede bivirkninger kan introducere en vis bias, da dette er investigatorbedømt, men i denne konkrete sag vil det nuancere vurderingen yderligere.",

      "text": "Herunder findes citater fra medicinrådet i denne konkrete sag, hvor vi vurderer at argumentationen ikke er konsistent i rapporten.\n” Medicinrådet vurderer, baseret på klinisk erfaring, at ansøgers valgte ekstrapolering for docetaxel er for optimistisk, da det er usandsynligt, at ca. 4 % af patienterne forsat er i live ved docetaxelbehandling efter 5 år. Derfor ændrer Medicinrådet ekstrapoleringen af OS for docetaxel til eksponentiel fordeling, se den orange kurve i Figur 4. Dette skyldes, at den eksponentielle fordeling har det bedste statistiske fit (jf. AIC/BIC) af de tre fordelinger (Weibull, Gompertz og eksponentiel), der vurderes at være klinisk plausible. Medicinrådet ekstrapolerer ligeledes OS for sotorasib med eksponentiel fordeling, da der ikke er kliniske argumenter for, at den parametriske fordeling bør variere mellem de to behandlingsarme. ”\nPublic\nTidligere i ansøgningen har medicinrådet fremført følgende argument baseret på det danske lungecancer register:\n” Femårsoverlevelsen for den samlede patientgruppe med uhelbredelig NSCLC er 2-3 % (patienter diagnosticeret i 2015 ) ”\nSiden 2015 er IO behandling rykket i første linje for hele patientpopulationen, hvilket med rimelighed kan antages at forbedre femårsoverlevelsen fremover. Medicinrådssekretariatet vælger altså at reducere overlevelsen for begge behandlingsarme betragteligt på baggrund af en usikkerhed vedrørende 1% i komparatorarmen. Dette underbygges i nogen grad af årsrapporten fra DLCG 2021, hvor der ses en markant 1 øgning af 5 årsoverlevelsen for patienter fra 2016 sammenlignet med 2015 (fra 3.7-5.3), dette indikere en betydelige forbedring i overlevelse på området.",

Medicinrådet ændrer derfor administrationsomkostningerne for docetaxel til et administrationsbesøg. Hertil anvendes enhedsomkostningen på 2.180 DKK, svarende til 2022 DRG-taksten (04MA98) MDC04 1- dagsgruppe, pat. mindst 7 år), jf. Interaktiv DRG med diagnosekode: ’Kræft i lunge og procedurekode: Med icingivning med intravenøs injektion’ .\nUden at forholde sig til om den nævnte takst over- eller underestimerer ressourceforbruget ifbm. behandling med docetaxel, kan det da retfærdiggøres at reducere en takst med +15.000 kr på baggrund af at taksten skulle inkludere et lægemiddel der koster 150 kr per dosis?\nHvis medicinrådet er usikre på risikoen for dobbelttælling, som det beskrives her, så burde løsningen, på baggrund af denne argumentation, være at reducere lægemiddelomkostningen for docetaxel til 0 istedet.\nSet i lyset af at Amgen her har dokumenteret valget af denne takst, ved at konsultere to kliniske eksperter på forskellige hospitaler, der har adspurgt relevant personale på deres respektive afdelinger om hvilke takster der anvendes ifbm. administration af docetaxel - og at disse klinikeres kontaktoplysninger er delt med medicinrådet - så finder vi ikke ovenstående argumentation fyldestgørende.",

There are several approved treatments targeting specific driver mutations in NSCLC that have improved patient survival significantly compared with non-targeted treatments for patients with an actionable mutation(1). However, currently, no approved treatment is available that specifically targets the KRAS G12C driver mutation in NSCLC. Standard of care treatment for KRAS G12C mutated NSCLC is currently the same as for patients with non- targetable mutations. This includes PD-(L)1 inhibitors (with or without platinum chemotherapy) for first-line (1L) treatment of advanced NSCLC. Nearly all patients progress on these treatments and receive limited benefit from SOC cytotoxic chemotherapy treatments in subsequent lines of therapy. Most patients experience a decline in performance status during 1L therapy that limits their tolerance for and the effect of second line and beyond (2L+) chemotherapy. Therefore, this patient group (KRAS G12C NSCLC) has a particularly high unmet need for effective and tolerable therapies, that can improve survival outcomes without compromising health-related quality of life (HRQoL) including toxicity.",

Evidence from CodeBreak 100 indicates that sotorasib is highly effective when used in line with its indication as a second- or subsequent-line therapy. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.8 months, and median overall survival (OS) was 12.5 months in the trial.\nThere is a lack of head-to-head trial data specifically considering KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC. However, indirect treatment comparisons using robust data sources and methods provide plausible early evidence of clinically meaningful improvements in survival outcomes for patients treated with sotorasib compared with the current standard of care, non-targeted therapy. For Docetaxel, the SELECT-1 trial was identified as the data basis in KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC 2L patients. Median PFS X and median OS was X OS in SELECT-1 for docetaxel monotherapy.\nThe clinical value of sotorasib compared to docetaxel is best demonstrated by the critical outcome measures PFS and OS. The results from the matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) for PFS, demonstrate that sotorasib provides X gain in median PFS compared with docetaxel monotherapy (X This exceeds the minimal clinically important difference of 3 months in median PFS(7) set by the Danish Medicines Council (DMC). For OS, the MAIC indicates that sotorasib provides a X gain in median OS compared with the primary comparator docetaxel monotherapy (X. This exceeds the minimal clinically important difference of 3 months in median OS(7) set by DMC. Safety outcomes were compared narratively and were limited by the fact that exposure times in the available evidence were not comparable between the sotorasib and docetaxel. The median duration of treatment was 5.5 months for sotorasib and 2.4 months for docetaxel. Sotorasib presented a lower occurrence of grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) (20% vs 30%) and a lower numerical rate of treatment discontinuations due to AEs (9% vs 14.5%). Patients with NSCLC generally report high symptomatic burden and impaired physical function and quality of life(8, 9). Health-related quality of life was investigated in CodeBreak 100 using the EORTC QLQ-C30 measure. Patients treated with sotorasib generally sustained or improved compared with baseline. Sotorasib is expected to be safer and more tolerable compared to docetaxel, aligning with the clinical expectation of safety of a targeted therapy compared to chemotherapies. In conclusion, sotorasib can address the significant unmet need for a targeted, more effective, tolerable, and convenient treatment that improves clinical outcomes for patients with KRAS G12C -mutated NSCLC compared to the current standard chemotherapy option.",

Lung tumors differ widely in terms of growth rates and response to treatment (10-12). However, metastatic lung cancer is almost uniformly and rapidly fatal (10). Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are essential to improve the prognosis of patients with lung cancer. While the survival of lung cancer patients has been steadily increasing the last half decade, likely due to introduction of immunotherapy and targeted therapies for managing advanced NSCLC in Denmark(4), lung cancer still remains the leading cause of cancer mortality in Denmark, representing 21.9% of cancer related death for males and 23.5% for females between 2015 and 2019(13). Data from the Danish Lung Cancer registry showed that the observed 2-year survival for patients on palliative treatment was 23.2%, an increase of 10% from 2014 (12.7%). While the observed 5-year survival for patients on palliative treatment was 4% for the latest cohort.\nIn 2020, 4876 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer in Denmark(4). NSCLC accounts for approximately 87.5% of lung cancer cases in Denmark(4) and comprises several histological subtypes, which can be categorized into squamous and non-squamous. Approximately 79% of NSCLC is non-squamous, adenocarcinomas (~ 48%) (4), represents the most common subtype of NSCLC in Denmark. Adenocarcinomas develop from the mucus-producing cells of smaller airways along the periphery (outer edges) of the lung (14, 15). Although adenocarcinomas mostly occur in current or former smokers, they are also the most common type of lung cancer in people who have never smoked (15). The remainder of the non-squamous NSCLC tumors are rare subtypes and non-small cell carcinoma and other specified carcinomas (52.1%)(4). Brain metastases are found in approximately 10% of patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC and 26% of patients with stage IV disease (16). Other common sites of metastases include the liver, adrenal glands, and bones. The distribution of types of lung cancer by histology in Denmark is shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1.

Lung adenocarcinomas also have a very high tumor mutation burden (~ 8.9 somatic mutations per megabase) (20-22), and more than 50% of lung adenocarcinomas have at least 1 genetic mutation, rearrangement, fusion, and/or amplification that is known to initiate and drive tumor growth (23). The introduction of genomic testing and drug therapies targeting specific driver mutations represent major breakthroughs in the treatment of NSCLC (24). Currently, targeted therapies are approved by EMA for NSCLC tumors with alterations in anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ), B-Raf proto-oncogene ( BRAF ), epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ), mesenchymal-epithelial transition gene ( MET ), rearranged during transfection ( RET ), c- ros oncogene 1 ( ROS1 ), and neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 ( NTRK1 ) genes (25). Comprehensive molecular testing at NSCLC diagnosis is recommended to optimize the use of tissue for testing and to inform treatment selection for metastatic disease in Denmark(2, 3). The timely identification of patients who are candidates for targeted therapies and administration of appropriate therapy has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in NSCLC (1, 26-28). However, oncogenic driver mutations still remain for which no targeted therapy has been successfully developed. These include KRAS mutations, of which the most frequently occurring in NSCLC is the KRAS G12C mutation (29).",

Mutations in KRAS genes can disrupt the processes involved in the proliferation and survival of tumor cells. Of the KRAS mutations, an estimated 80% occur at codon 12. The KRAS gene with a mutation resulting in a G12C amino acid substitution ( KRAS G12C mutation) in codon 12 is a single guanine to thymine substitution that results in a glycine to cysteine substitution at amino acid position 12. This structural change in the protein results in a defect in the association of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which reduces the normal hydrolysis of GTP by GTPases, and resulting in the accumulation of KRAS proteins in the ‘active’ state . The resulting accumulation of active, GTP-bound KRAS proteins disrupts the process of apoptosis and promotes tumor proliferation and survival (31). The KRAS G12C mutation is therefore an oncogenic driver and KRAS\nmutations are generally acknowledged as negative prognostic factors for both treatment response and survival outcomes in patients with NSCLC, as well as other solid tumors (32, 33).",

Approximately two-thirds of patients with NSCLC have advanced disease at diagnosis (39), when curative treatment is not possible. Advanced NSCLC is highly symptomatic, with most patients experiencing symptoms related to the location and size of the tumor, such as shortness of breath, cough, and pain, as well as constitutional symptoms, such as fatigue (40, 41).

This equates to 292 KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC cases in Denmark in 2020. The estimated incidence of the KRAS G12C mutation is similar to the incidence suggested by two Danish clinical experts within NSCLC(2, 3). The two clinical experts suggested an annual incidence of 250-300 KRAS G12C mutations eligible for 1L treatment.

      "text": "Tumor-targeted therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC with molecular alterations in EGFR , ALK , BRAF , ROS , and RET proteins . However, the KRAS G12C mutation rarely occurs at the same time as these other actionable mutations, meaning that existing tumor-targeted therapies are not an option for patients with KRAS G12C mutation (58-61). Patients with KRAS G12C- mutated NSCLC are therefore managed in the same way as those without an actionable mutation.\nIn line with the current treatment guidelines from the DLCG (6), clinical experts (2, 3) confirmed that an increasing majority of patients in Denmark with NSCLC without currently actionable mutations now receive anti- PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy or as monotherapy in the first- line of therapy. Clinical experts confirmed that sotorasib would be used as an alternative to docetaxel monotherapy following recurring disease after frontline therapy with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy(2, 3). The proposed positioning of sotorasib, in line with its licensed indication, is therefore as a second or subsequent line therapy following prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and/or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. This positioning is aligned with the pivotal clinical trial data supporting the conditional EU regulatory approval (CodeBreak 100) and confirms that the relevant comparator for sotorasib is docetaxel monotherapy. Further, as docetaxel monotherapy is recognized in the DOLG guideline as the second- and subsequent-line option in NSCLC, docetaxel is deemed the appropriate comparator for this appraisal (6).\nDocetaxel has not been approved as standard treatment for NSCLC by the DMC and according to the DMC guidelines if this is the case companies should develop CUA that estimates the cost-effectiveness of the chosen comparator against either placebo or BSC. This has not been developed as there are no clinical data enabling a CUA between docetaxel and placebo/BSC for the relevant patient population. Furthermore, we consider docetaxel to be the most relevant and cost-effective comparator. In current clinical practice, the majority of patients in 2nd line who are candidates for treatment will be offered treatment with docetaxel.\nWe find it very unlikely that patients will be offered an inferior treatment, such as placebo or BSC, in that docetaxel is both a cheap treatment regimen with demonstrated efficacy and is an established treatment in current Danish and international clinical practice. This is also supported by the fact that in the recent assessment of selpercatinib for non-small cell lung cancer, the Medicine Council concluded that active treatment, including docetaxel, was the appropriate comparator to address the decision issue.\nWe find it very likely that docetaxel will be a cost-effective alternative in a comparison with either placebo or BSC. As mentioned above, recent changes in frontline treatment means platinum-based chemotherapy is now a relevant treatment alternative for patients with PD-L1>50% in 2L that has been given checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy in 1L.\nAmgen is not aware of specific clinical trials investigating the efficacy of platinum chemotherapy as a 2.L treatment for the relevant patient population after first-line immunotherapy, and therefore it has not been possible to include platinum-based chemotherapy as a comparator arm in an appropriate manner in the application.\nAs there is no relevant data for platinum-based chemotherapy to address the decision question, we have consulted a clinical expert and validated that Docetaxel is also a relevant comparator across PD-L1>50% levels for NSCLC as a chemoalternative. Docetaxel is also referred to in the DMCG clinical guidelines for the treatment of 2L NSCLC.\nWe expect that the cost-effectiveness of sotorasib versus platinum-based chemotherapy will be equal to the cost-effectiveness versus docetaxel, since these are low-cost treatment regimens, both of which have a very limited clinical efficacy. The expected incremental costs as well as effects for sotorasib versus platinum-based chemotherapy as well as docetaxel are therefore assumed to be comparable. The best alternative to assessing cost-effectiveness versus platinum-based chemotherapy is to use data from the Flatiron database (Appendix L - Flatiron). These data are based on a basket of chemotherapy regimens, including platinum-based chemotherapy which is the most common regime in the basket ( Table 60 ). This analysis was performed as a confirmatory analysis to validate the primary MAIC analysis of sotorasib versus docetaxel monotherapy using a basket of chemotherapies as a source to represent docetaxel. However, given that the most common chemoregimen in the basket of chemotherapy regimens in the Flatiron dataset was platinum-based chemotherapy the analysis also represent a pragmatic approach to show that the result of sotorasib versus platinum-based chemo does not differ significantly from the comparison of sotorasib vs docetaxel.\nThe analysis using the Flatiron chemobasket as a comparator was included as a scenario analysis. The dataset for the comparator arm can be changed in the CE model.",

Patients who are eligible for further treatment in 2L or subsequent-line therapy receive docetaxel as also described in the clinical guideline by the DLCG (6). Sotorasib, is therefore expected to displace docetaxel in 2L treatment. Sotorasib is an inhibitor of the KRAS G12C-mutated protein. It forms an irreversible covalent bond highly- specifically with the unique cysteine of KRAS G12C, locking the protein in an inactive state that inhibits downstream signaling, inhibits cell growth, and promotes apoptosis in KRAS G12C tumor cell lines (62). No other wild-type or mutant protein or receptor has been identified to which sotorasib binds, nor has any effect been observed in cells without the KRAS G12C mutation. As the KRAS G12C mutation only has been found in tumor tissues, and not in normal tissue (63, 64), sotorasib has the potential to be highly tolerable compared with standard of care chemotherapy.\nAs an inhibitor of KRAS G12C, the presence of a KRAS G12C mutation must be confirmed using a validated test prior to initiation of therapy with sotorasib. In Denmark, KRAS testing is part of regional standards for NGS panels used as part of the diagnosis of NSCLC patients. Therefore, no additional tests beyond the routine diagnostic workup and management of patients with NSCLC are required alongside the introduction of sotorasib.

This approach is deemed feasible as the global SLR was broader and will therefore have included all studies relevant for the scope of this application. The local adaptation was conducted to restrict the literature included in the global SLR to studies with either sotorasib or docetaxel in adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated in 2L+. The local adaptation only included comparator studies with sufficient sample size and reporting to allow for a MAIC, which was necessary as the primary evidence for sotorasib was a single-arm trial. These selection criteria were applied to the studies as they reflect the EMA-indication and proposed scope of the application for sotorasib for KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC in Denmark. In brief, an SLR was commissioned to identify RCTs that report clinical effectiveness and safety of 2L therapies licensed in the United States and the EU.

The SLR conformed to published guidelines issued by the Cochrane Collaboration (1) and the Centre for Reviews & Dissemination (CRD; York, UK) and followed the methodological requirements of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), UK. Reporting was in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) (66), and the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and statements (66-70). The SLR search was initially conducted in June 2020, and an updated search was conducted on 26 January 2021. Details of the search strategies used are presented in Appendix A - Literature search for efficacy and safety of intervention and comparator(s) . Searches were conducted in Embase, Medline, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), for the original and updated searches.\nA total of 61 references were included in the global SLR for safety and efficacy (both RCT and single-arm studies). Based on the references included at the full-text level for the global SLR, Amgen made a local adaptation to the Danish context using the detailed PICOS-criteria described in Appendix A - Literature search for efficacy and safety of intervention and comparator(s), which included a total of two references from two studies. Studies in\nthe full-text screening from the global SLR with docetaxel as the comparator were excluded, which either 1) had too small a study population, 2) did not include the correct population, or 3) held insufficient information to conduct a MAIC analysis. Only the SELECT-1 study was deemed feasible to conduct a MAIC and is consequently the only study used to derive comparative efficacy estimates. Additional sources of evidence have been added to support the application, as some results were not reported in the primary publications of the studies(71).\nA full PRISMA diagram outlining the selection process in the global SLR and local adaption is given in Appendix A - Literature search for efficacy and safety of intervention and comparator(s) .",

CodeBreak 100 (73) is an open-label, multi-national, single-arm, phase II study evaluating the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability in adult subjects with locally advanced or metastatic KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC who are\ncandidates to 2L or a subsequent-line of therapy. All patients were required to have experienced disease progression after the receipt of anti – PD-1 or anti – PD-L1 immunotherapy or platinum-based combination chemotherapy or after the receipt of both immunotherapy and platinum-based combination chemotherapy. Study design and baseline characteristics of the study population are respectively presented in Table 11 and Table 12. SELECT-1 (72) was identified as the appropriate study to be used as the comparator study, where patients receive docetaxel. SELECT-1 is a multi-national, randomized, phase III study evaluating the clinical efficacy of selumetinib in combination with docetaxel as second-line therapy for advanced KRAS -mutant NSCLC. SELECT-1 included placebo plus docetaxel as a comparator arm, this comparator arm will form the data basis for the clinical evidence of docetaxel in this appraisal. All patients were required to have radiological documentation of disease progression following 1L or subsequent anti-cancer therapy. Study design and baseline characteristics of the study population are respectively presented in Table 11 and Table 12.\nThe study designs might affect the comparison of outcomes as CodeBreak 100 is an open-label single-arm study and SELECT-1 is a randomized placebo-controlled study. Further, CodeBreak 100 include patients with prior anti- PD-1 treatment, whereas there were no patients with prior PD-1 treatment included in SELECT-1. Although CodeBreak 100 included patients with 1-3 prior therapies, restricting matches to only patients with 1 prior therapy, as were included in SELECT-1, would reduce the available CodeBreak 100 trial population by 57%, which would have significant implications for the precision of any relative treatment effect estimates. The inability to robustly match for number of prior lines of therapy or prior use of immunotherapy is a potential limitation that arises due to limited comparator trial data specifically in KRAS-mutant NSCLC. However, PFS and OS outcomes are likely to be worse for patients with each successive line of therapy. Given that CodeBreak 100 included 57% of patients with 2 or more prior lines of therapy, a comparison of PFS and OS data from the whole of the CodeBreak 100 NSCLC population against PFS and OS data from patients in SELECT-1, who had received only one prior line of therapy, is likely to be conservative. This assumption is further validated as subgroup analysis from CodeBreak 100 showed median OS in patients that received only 1 prior line of therapy was 17.7 months (7.9, NE) (Amgen data on file)\nTable 8 patient subgroups by prior lines of therapy (Amgen data on file) N mOS Patient subgroups (OS) months (95% CI)",

Instead, the relative efficacy of two treatments can often be estimated using indirect treatment comparisons for OS and PFS. In this analysis, the relative efficacy was assessed using an unanchored MAIC, a method that allows assessment of efficacy benefit between treatments when a common comparator is missing by adjusting for population-level differences present in different data sources (74).\nThe MAIC used data from two clinical studies: the CodeBreak 100 trial for sotorasib and the SELECT-1 trial for docetaxel. Comparability of the data sources, and hence the feasibility and appropriateness of performing a MAIC, was assessed through a review of the design and population profiles of the studies involved in the analyses. The MAIC for OS and PFS is presented in section 7.2.1. Details of the comparison of studies, populations, and methods used in the studies are presented in Appendix K - MAIC . As for the safety outcomes of interest, no MAIC analysis has been conducted, and data is therefore presented narratively in section 7.2.2. A comparison of HRQoL was not feasible as the relevant data was not available and SELECT-1 used a different patient reported outcomes-tool for the docetaxel arm.

CodeBreak 100 is an open-label Phase II study which evaluated the safety, tolerability, and clinical efficacy of sotorasib in (n = 126) subjects with NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation.\nDocetaxel is a current standard of care for this patient group in Denmark and was therefore chosen as the comparator. A comparison of the CodeBreak 100 and SELECT-1 studies is presented in Table 11. A feasibility analysis is presented in Appendix K - MAIC .\nBoth CodeBreak 100 and SELECT-1 were multicenter studies and had similar inclusion and exclusion criteria, which included subjects with confirmed locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (stage IIIB – IV) who had failed one prior line of therapy (LOT). The enrolled population in the CodeBreak 100 study is slightly wider than that of SELECT-1, as patients who have failed two (35%) or three (21%) prior LOTs were also included Patient-level baseline characteristics and outcomes data for NSCLC patients treated with sotorasib were taken from the CodeBreaK 100 trial (March 2021 data cut). Data on docetaxel-treated patients was taken from the SELECT-1 Phase 3 RCT of patients randomized to selumetinib plus docetaxel or docetaxel plus placebo (Janne et al, 2017). As patient-level data was not available for docetaxel, baseline patient characteristics and Kaplan – Meier PFS and OS curves were digitized and pseudo-patient-level data were created using the algorithm of Guyot et al. (Guyot P. et al, 2012).\nCodeBreak 100 and SELECT-1 reported PFS and OS as primary or secondary endpoints. In SELECT-1, PFS was measured by RECIST 1.1 every 6 weeks by the investigator. In CodeBreak 100, PFS was also measured by RECIST 1.1 every 6 weeks for the first 8 assessments, and every 12 weeks subsequently. PFS was assessed by both independent central review and by an investigator. The latter (investigator-based PFS) was used in the base-case of the MAIC analyses, as it is aligned with the progression assessment reported in the SELECT-1 trial. CodeBreak 100 is a single-arm Phase II study, whereas SELECT-1 is a randomized placebo-controlled phase III study. These differences in the trial design may confound the outcomes; this potential issue is not adjusted for in the MAIC.\nTable 11.

Adjusting for all available variables would have resulted in a small bias, but also in a very low precision, with stochastic uncertainty causing results to be imprecise and inaccurate. Therefore, the number of variables adjustment for was restricted, keeping the variables that are most likely to remove bias. Variables that were considered less important in terms of bias, but would still increase stochastic uncertainty, were considered for removal. Variables identified as relevant prognostic variables were included for the base-case analysis.

The distribution of patients between the two studies is similar in terms of age, with median ages of 63 and 61 years reported, respectively. Gender distribution is balanced in CodeBreak 100 and is slightly skewed towards males in the SELECT-1 study. Approximately 82% of subjects are white in CodeBreak 100, with comparable estimates higher in SELECT-1 (where 95% of patients are white).\nAdjustment for brain metastases was not possible as they were not reported for SELECT-1. KRAS G12C mutation status could not be used for the adjustment, as all CodeBreak 100 patients were KRAS G12C patients, and for the docetaxel arm in SELECT-1, there was no patient-level data available. CodeBreak 100 includes patients with prior anti-PD-(L)1 treatment, whereas SELECT-1 patients did not. This difference is accounted for as anti-PD-(L)1 therapies were not yet approved for treatment when SELECT-1 was conducted. Adjusting for anti PD-(L)1 treatment in prior lines would result in the removal of 91% of CodeBreak 100 patients and was therefore unfeasible. For prior lines of therapy, 57% of patients included in CodeBreak 100 had 2 or more prior line of therapy, while all patients in SELECT-1 only received one prior line of therapy. Adjusting for prior line of therapy would results in a loss of 43% of patients in CodeBreak 100, a substantial loss in effective sample size, and therefore not feasible. The effect estimates for sotorasib are therefore likely to be conservative as confirmed in subgroup analysis (data on file), as prior lines of therapy would be considered an important indicator of poor prognosis.\nTable 12.

Outcomes are reported in terms of HRs and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for the different MAIC models. Parameter uncertainty was quantified based on robust standard errors.\nThe starting list of candidate prognostic covariates was based on literature reviews and informed by discussions with experienced NSCLC physicians in the UK. These discussions involved separate interviews with physicians experienced in treating advanced NSCLC patients who have a robust understanding of the current NSCLC treatment landscape. The literature was also reviewed to better understand what the most important confounding factors are (for prognosis), and to consider their inclusion in the matching algorithm/propensity score analysis. A total of six individual interviews were conducted via teleconferences with two physicians from Canada and one each from the US, Germany, France, and the UK. Pre-read documents (including a questionnaire) were circulated to the physicians; their corresponding responses and individual summary reports were shared with each of them for validation. Further details about the elicitation are provided in a supplementary document (76). Five covariates were considered very important, and 13 were considered as somewhat important. Three additional prognostic covariates were added to the list based on their inclusion in recently conducted MAICs in treatment interventions in the NSCLC disease area, as noted by the expert clinicians (Amgen data on file 2020). Additional covariates related to race, ethnicity, and histology at baseline were also considered. These covariates had been included in previously reported MAICs conducted in NSCLC (77-79). Details of the identification of these studies are presented in the MAIC protocol (80). The covariates considered in the various MAIC analyses are presented in Table 13.\nPD-L1 protein expression at baseline was excluded as it is only a relevant prognostic factor for anti-PD-(L)1 treatment. However, for treatment with sotorasib and docetaxel, based on clinical expert feedback PD-L1 protein expression was not regarded as an important predictor.\nTable 13.

For OS, matching adjustment indicated that sotorasib provided a Xmonth gain in median OS compared with the primary comparator docetaxel monotherapy, exceeding the minimal clinically important difference of 3 months median OS, previously defined by the lung cancer expert committee at DMC(7).

The estimated hazard ratios for OS and PFS were similar between the unadjusted analysis and base-case MAIC analysis (X). The primary MAIC analysis focused on available covariates of prognostic importance, and the matching preserved an effective sample size of over 106 patients. This represented a small loss of data compared with the pre-adjusted sample size. Sensitivity analysis, and the fact that the analyses could not be adjusted for the greater negative prognostic factors in the sotorasib trial population, suggest these estimates may be conservative. Given the phase 2 single-arm trial data currently available in support of sotorasib, and the lack of data for the relevant comparators specifically in KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC, every effort has been made to derive the most robust possible indirect estimates of relative efficacy for this innovative therapy. These analyses indicate that sotorasib is a highly effective therapy that plausibly provides clinically meaningful improvements in survival outcomes compared with current, non-targeted standard of care therapies (docetaxel). Sotorasib, therefore, provides a much-needed targeted treatment option in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC.",

      "text": "® The economic evaluation was developed using a cost-effectiveness framework in Microsoft Excel . A partitioned survival analysis was used based on three distinct health states (Figure 6): progression-free, progressed disease, and dead. All patients entered the model in the progression-free state and were at risk of progression of disease or death. Transitions to the death state occurred from either the progression-free or progressed disease health states. Death was an ‘absorbing state’, where once entered, patients reside for the remainder of the model time horizon.\nFigure 6. Partitioned survival analysis model\nThis model structure is fully aligned with the primary objectives of treatment in oncology and NSCLC, namely avoiding disease progression and prolonging life. Furthermore, the structure and health states selected are typical of modelling in oncology and have been used in previous NSCLC technology appraisals.\nThe model contains the three most relevant disease related health states: • Progression-free: Patient disease is in a stable or responding state and not actively progressing. Patients in this state are assumed to incur costs associated with treatment, administration, medical management of the condition and the management of grade 3/4 adverse events. • Progressed: Patient disease has progressed. This health state is associated with costs of disease management in post-progression. • Death: This is an absorbing state. The proportions of patients in each health state at the beginning of each model cycle are calculated from the PFS and OS survival functions from relevant clinical trials as follows, where PF(t) is the proportion of patients who are progression-free at time (t), Dead(t) is the proportion of patients who are not alive at time (t) (1 – OS)\nand PP(t) is the proportion of patients who are not progression-free and who are still alive at time (t). In the model, all patients start treatment in the progression-free health state:\nThe estimated time on treatment for each treatment in the analysis was used to inform acquisition costs and related administration costs. Additional costs included in the analysis include disease management costs per health state and subsequent treatment cost. As discussed in Section 8.5.2.3, costs associated with genetic mutation testing are not required to be captured in the model because KRAS G12C testing is routinely funded as part of panel testing at diagnosis. It is therefore assumed that all patients entering the model have a KRAS G12C mutation-positive status. The progression-free health state typically reflects a relatively higher HRQoL associated with disease before progression, where patients are receiving benefit from an active treatment, whereas the progressed disease state is designed to capture the relatively poor HRQoL following disease progression. As the use of progression- status based utilities is common practice within oncology modelling, this have been chosen as the base-case in the model. However, as previous studies have shown NSCLC patients to have markedly decreased utilities towards the end of life, the measurements included in the model as a scenario analysis were informed by a time- to-death analysis (81). This approach has been used in previous NICE TAs (82-84).\nTime-to-death sub- health states were therefore implemented to capture patients’ quality of life as a function of how much lifetime patients had left until they eventually died as predicted in the model. The use of time-to- death sub-health states was implemented considering four health states: less than 1 month before death, 1 – 3 months before, 3 – 6 months before, and more than 6 months before death. This time-to-death approach was explored in a scenario analysis. The analyses were conducted from a restricted societal perspective and are consistent with DMC guidelines(85). The model uses a 7-day cycle length, with a half-cycle correction applied and a time horizon of 20 years. This aligns with the maximum life expectancy of the cohort predicted by parametric survival analysis and was considered appropriate by clinically experts given that it is highly unlikely for patients with NSCLC with the KRAS G12C mutation with advanced or metastatic disease to survive beyond this time point. The impact of the selection of the time horizon on results is explored in a sensitivity analysis. A discount rate of 3.5% per annum was applied for costs and outcomes. The perspective chosen, time horizon assessed, and the discount rate used are all in line with the DMC guidelines.",

Comparability of the data sources – and hence the feasibility and appropriateness of performing a MAIC – was assessed through a review of the design and population profiles of the studies involved in the analyses. Details of the comparison of studies, populations and methods used in the studies are presented in Appendix K - MAIC . Please consult section 7.2.1 for full details and the results of MAIC. For extrapolation, parametric curves were fitted to the MAIC-weighted time-to-event data. A variety of options were assessed which considered alternative distribution functions, i.e., consideration of independently versus jointly fitted parametric models. As per the NICE decision support unit (DSU) guidance, extrapolations were assessed using goodness-of-fit statistics, visual match between the parametric fittings and the Kaplan-Meier (KM) data, and the clinical plausibility of long-term outcomes (88). For the given MAIC-weighted data, the proportional hazards assumption and the presence of accelerated failure time were assessed. This was done based on log cumulative hazard plots, Schoenfeld residuals, and QQ plots. The proportional hazards assumption was found not to be certain for either OS or PFS. Aligned with these findings and based on goodness-of-fit, a restricted and jointly fitted model was selected as the input for the cost- effectiveness model, with details provided for OS in Section 8.3.2 and for PFS in Section 8.3.3.\nThe extrapolations were assessed for visual match between the parametric fittings and the KM data, goodness- of-fit statistics and the clinical plausibility of long-term outcomes, in line with NICE DSU guidance (TSD 14) (88). In addition to the MAIC vs. SELECT-1, the Flatiron real-world data were used for sensitivity analysis. Here, a real- world chemotherapy-basket served as a proxy for docetaxel treatment. The rationale for this confirmative\nanalysis was first, that the SELECT-1 population was anti PD-(L)1 naïve. Second, as CodeBreak 100 is a single-arm trial, this alternative approach was applied to demonstrate the robustness of the results.

The unrestricted model fit statistics were presented so that the fit statistics (AIC/BIC) could be meaningfully compared between independent fitted and joint fitted models ( Table 23 ).\nFor the unrestricted models, any information relating to treatment arm does not inform the shape of the parametric distribution. In consequence, the curves of both treatment arms do not only differ in terms of a location parameter, but also the parameters that determine the shape are being estimated independently. In contrast, for the restricted model the treatment difference in both parameters depends solely on a location parameter. The shape determining parameters are estimated jointly. For the generalized gamma, log-logistic and log-normal distribution, the restricted model corresponds to an accelerated failure time model. For the Gompertz and the Weibull distribution the implemented restricted time to event corresponds to a proportional hazards model.

The log-cumulative hazards and the Schoenfeld residuals plot for sotorasib and docetaxel indicated that the proportional hazards assumption may stand true. The log-cumulative hazards plots for the first few months converge and form a kink at the 5 months mark; with a different slope apparent beyond 5 months (Figure 7). Most of the time, the point-wise CIs of the Schoenfeld residuals included zero; however, at around two months, the non-significance was borderline (Figure 8). Considering the slope, and the sample size, the validity of the proportional hazard’s assumption was considered uncertain.

Further, the diagnostic plots suggest that the proportional hazards assumption is likely to be violated and that an accelerated failure time model is appropriate.\nOne factor adding to the difficulty of fitting a parametric curve to PFS was that PFS data were not being collected at a truly continuous level. As progression was not continuously assessed, but only measured at certain points\nof times, the Kaplan – Meier curves were less smooth than those for OS. However, the Kaplan – Meier curves, did not provide justification for assuming different parametric functions or for fitting curves independently. Therefore, PFS was modeled based on a jointly fitted restricted model with log-normal distribution which is consistent with the distribution selected for OS and supported by the visual inspection versus the observed data. nd rd The 2 and 3 best performing distributions (jointly fitted [restricted] generalized gamma and log-logistic, respectively) were considered for sensitivity analyses.",

This approach, however, compared to the HR approach, is more complex but less accurate: The HR approach is based on a single parameter from a single trial. In contrast to OS and PFS, where time-to-event data of two trials are being combined, for TTD SELECT-1 based KM curves do not exist. Adding MAIC weights across trials would add complexity but not accuracy. Furthermore, more degrees of freedom plus the selection of a parametric distribution would be required. The HR approach better reflects the high causal relationship between PFS and TTD, as most patients discontinue treatment at progression. Independently fitted curves may unnecessarily yield misalignment. And given that more than 80% of patients had discontinued sotorasib by the March 2021 data cut snapshot there is low uncertainty related to the estimate We believe there is a strong statistical case to “tether” TTD to PFS and this is consistent with the clinical use of sotorasib. Therefore, the HR approach sufficiently accounts for the strong relationship between TTD and PFS. These two curves should not be modelled independently. Comparing the modelled curves with the corresponding KM curves shows the approximated relationship is reasonable. Furthermore, There is a strong precedent based on previous NICE submissions (and acceptance by appraisal committees) for methods that “tether” TTD to PFS for oncology medicines where this reflects how the treatment will be used – i.e. where TTD tends to be around PFS but not the same. For example: • In NSCLC it is common to assume TTD=PFS if this is in-line with the licence and SmPC wording or otherwise tether TTD to PFS by either applying a HR or adding a mean number of cycles of treatment at progression in the model (i.e. if TTD is slightly higher than PFS).

Clinical experts consulted for the NICE appraisal by Amgen verified that a treatment-specific disutility for docetaxel and would be appropriate to capture in the base-case analysis.

Sotorasib should therefore be made available as early as possible to address the high and urgent unmet needs of these patients, as real-world evidence suggests that the current prognosis for these patients is poor. As the standard 2L treatment of advanced KRAS G12C- mutated NSCLC in Denmark, docetaxel was selected as the appropriate comparator.\nSotorasib was investigated in a single-arm clinical trial, CodeBreak 100. No direct head-to-head evidence was available to compare the clinical efficacy of sotorasib and docetaxel. In such circumstances, the relative efficacy of two treatments can often be estimated using indirect treatment comparison methods for OS and PFS. In this analysis, the relative efficacy was assessed using an unanchored MAIC. This method allows assessment of efficacy between treatments when a common comparator is missing by adjusting for population-level differences present in different data sources (74).\nThe MAIC used data from two clinical studies: the CodeBreak 100 trial for sotorasib, and the SELECT-1 trial for docetaxel. Comparability of the data sources, and hence the feasibility and appropriateness of performing a MAIC, was assessed through a review of the design and population profiles of the studies involved in the analyses.",

For OS, matching adjustment indicates that sotorasib provides a X gain in median OS compared with the primary comparator docetaxel monotherapy (X), exceeding the minimal clinically important difference of 3 months in median OS(7).\nSafety outcomes were compared narratively and were limited by incomparable exposure times between sotorasib and docetaxel evidence. The median duration of treatment varied from 5.5 months for sotorasib to 2.4 months for docetaxel. Sotorasib presented a lower rate of treatment discontinuations due to AEs (8.7% vs. 14.5%), and lower occurrence of grade 3 or worse TRAEs (20.6% vs 30.0%).

In the context of a disease with no other targeted therapies, high and urgent unmet needs, and with limited available data, the evidence in support of sotorasib is compelling.

The lack of a direct trial comparison between sotorasib and docetaxel, necessitates the need to conduct an unanchored MAIC to estimate the relative treatment effect. An unanchored MAIC is based around a strong assumption that all effect modifiers and prognostic factors can be accounted for. The proportion of patients with stable brain metastases (both trials excluded patients with active brain metastases) was not reported in SELECT-1 and was 21% in CodeBreak 100 pre-matching (18% post matching). The analysis is potentially conservative for the comparative efficacy of sotorasib vs. docetaxel in this regard, as the presence of brain metastases is a negative prognostic factor, whereas in other previously treated NSCLC RCTs, the proportion of patients with stable brain metastases was consistently lower than in CodeBreak 100, suggesting there were potentially fewer patients with brain metastases in the SELECT-1 trial. As PFS and OS outcomes are likely to be worse for patients with each successive line of therapy, the comparison is likely to be biased in favor of docetaxel due to the differences in the patient population between CodeBreak 100 and SELECT-1. The SELECT-1 trial only included patients with one previous line of therapy. This compares with 57% of patients having had more than one line of therapy in CodeBreak 100. Furthermore, there is limited data for either sotorasib or docetaxel in patients with squamous KRAS G12C- mutated cancer. The CodeBreak 100 trial excluded patients at or above ECOG performance status 2, who would be particularly likely to benefit from sotorasib ’ s superior safety profile compared with docetaxel.",

The health economic analysis demonstrates that sotorasib is a novel and clinically effective treatment option for 2L+ NSCLC patients with the KRAS G12C mutation, which significantly improves life-years and QALYs compared with docetaxel. In the base-case analysis, the ICER for sotorasib versus docetaxel was X DKK/QALY and on life- years, the ICER was X DKK/LY. This would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of DKK 750,000 per\nQALY. Results of the probabilistic sensitivity analyses are consistent with the base-case results, indicating that the base-case results are robust to parameter uncertainty. The PSA estimated a X% probability that sotorasib is cost-effective compared to docetaxel at the given threshold of DKK 750,000 per QALY. The BIM suggested that the estimated budget impact of recommending sotorasib as standard treatment in Denmark was X million DKK in year 1 and X million DKK in year 5, when assuming 125 new patients would be eligible for treatment with sotorasib each year.\nThe most clinically plausible extrapolations of PFS and OS data were selected for the base-case analysis and extensive scenario analyses were conducted to assess the impact of alternative modeling choices with only a small impact on the results of the analyses.\nA key strength of the analysis is that given the similarity of patient populations, the risk of bias is expected to be low. However, due to the highly pre-treated population of CodeBreak 100, the potentially remaining bias most likely favors docetaxel. Therefore, the outcomes of the MAIC analysis can be considered conservative. Secondly, the model appears to be robust to parameter uncertainty and structural uncertainty.

The indirect treatment comparison suggests that sotorasib provides a superior treatment option for these patients compared to docetaxel, providing PFS and OS gains which exceed the minimally clinical important differences of 3 months, previously defined by the lung cancer expert committee at DMC(7). Health economic analysis demonstrates that sotorasib is a more effective and more costly treatment option compared to docetaxel that would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 750,000 DKK per QALY. The interpretation of the current clinical evidence is somewhat limited by the current lack of a direct comparison between sotorasib and docetaxel. This limitation will be addressed in the future with results of the ongoing phase 3 randomized, active-controlled CodeBreak 200 study, where sotorasib and docetaxel are compared head- to-head. Survival and additional clinical benefits of sotorasib will be confirmed in this trial. Similar or perhaps better efficacy estimates may be seen in the ongoing Phase III study.",

The following electronic databases were searched via the OVID platform: • Embase, 1980 to present day • MEDLINE®, incorporating: o MEDLINE®, 1946 to present day o MEDLINE® In Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations o MEDLINE® Epub Ahead of Print and MEDLINE® Daily • The Cochrane Library, incorporating; o the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Cochrane Reviews) o the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) The database search strings identified relevant studies (full papers or conference abstracts) indexed in Embase, and were modified to perform the searches in MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library, to account for differences in syntax and thesaurus headings. Searches include terms for free text and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms. The search strategy for each database, and associated number of hits, are presented below for the June 2020 and the January 2021 update.",

In total, 1240 relevant publications were identified from electronic searches as part of the SLR update and 522 as part of the SLR re-screen. We included 626 publications for double-blind full text review from SLR Update and SLR Rescreen combined. Additionally, 8 abstracts from congress searches and 5 clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. As a result, 38 publications and 5 clinical trials identified through electronic and supplementary searches were included for data extraction.

      "text": "Method of analysis PFS is the primary endpoint. However, the study has been sized to characterize the OS benefit of selumetinib 75mg bd in combination with docetaxel. Approximately 500 KRAS mutation positive tumor patients will be randomized between the two treatment arms to obtain approximately 325 death events (65% maturity). The final analysis of PFS will take place on a pre-specified date when it is predicted that 325 death events will have occurred. The exact date will be predicted by modelling the blinded death rate data. If the true OS hazard ratio (HR) for the comparison of selumetinib 75mg bd in combination with docetaxel 75mg/m2 vs. placebo in combination with docetaxel 75mg/m2 is 0.72, this number of events will provide at least 80% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference for OS, assuming a 2% 1-sided Type I error. This OS HR corresponds to an approximate 2-month improvement in median OS over an estimate of 5.2 months (estimated from D1532C00016) for placebo in combination with docetaxel, assuming proportional hazards and exponential data distribution. A 2-month improvement in median OS is regarded as clinically meaningful. The smallest treatment difference that would be statistically significant at the final analysis is an OS HR of approximately 0.80 (0.796 if exactly 325 OS events). Efficacy data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis using randomized treatment. PFS, OS, and time to symptom progression using the ASBI will be analyzed using a stratified logrank test. The results will be presented in terms of the HR, associated two- sided confidence interval (CI), and p-value. Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots of PFS, OS, and time to symptom progression will also be presented. ORR and symptom improvement rate using the ASBI will be analyzed using a logistic regression adjusted for the stratification factors WHO Performance Status (1/0) and tumor histology (squamous/non-squamous). In order to describe the nature of the benefits of selumetinib treatment, PFS, OS, ORR, time to symptom progression, and symptom improvement rate will be tested at a 2-sided significance level of 5%. However, in order to strongly control the type, I error at 2.5% 1- sided, a multiple testing procedure (MTP) with an alpha-exhaustive recycling strategy (Burman et al 2009) will also be employed across the primary endpoint (PFS) and key secondary endpoints (i.e., OS and ORR). Safety data will be summarised and listed for all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment (selumetinib/placebo) based on the treatment received. No formal statistical testing will be performed on the safety data. Adverse events will be summarised by preferred term and system organ class (using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA]). Summaries of AEs by causality and CTC grade will also be presented.\nSubgroup analyses Prespecified subgroup analyses will be conducted comparing PFS between treatments in the subgroups of the full analysis set defined by the stratification factors WHO PS and histology, plus the following factors: • Gender (Male vs. Female) • Age at randomisation (< 65 vs. = 65) • Smoking status (smoker vs. non-smoker (never smoker) • Status of disease (Locally advanced vs. Metastatic) The purpose of the subgroup analyses is to assess the consistency of treatment effect across expected prognostic factors but from the results observed in Phase II (D1532C00016) it is not expected that these factors will be predictive factors for a qualitatively different treatment effect. No adjustment to the significance level for testing will be made since all these analyses will be considered supportive of the primary analysis of PFS.\nMedicinrådet Dampfærgevej 27-29, 3. th.

The systematic literature reviews described in Appendix A sought to identify clinical trials of therapies conducted in patients with KRAS - mutant NSCLC, and identified only one RCT (SELECT-1) that provided sufficient PFS and OS data for docetaxel monotherapy (the primary comparator) in a population of patients with KRAS -mutated NSCLC (including G12C and non- G12C mutations) (127). Several published observational studies in Western (European, Australian and US) populations show that survival in patients with KRAS G12C -mutated NSCLC is similarly poor as that in patients with other KRAS mutations or wild type disease who are not eligible for existing targeted therapies (72, 128, 129). The SELECT-1 trial itself showed that survival outcomes were highly consistent for those with KRAS G12C-mutated and those with other KRAS -mutated NSCLC (129). On this basis, the PFS and OS data for docetaxel from the SELECT-1 trial in patients with KRAS -mutant NSCLC (including G12C and non- G12C mutations) is considered to be sufficiently reflective of PFS and OS in patients with KRAS G12C -mutated NSCLC who receive placebo plus docetaxel. The SELECT-1 trial was therefore considered to be a candidate to provide comparator data for the primary comparison of sotorasib vs. placebo plus docetaxel. This approach was agreed as reasonable by the five UK clinical experts attending an Amgen advisory board meeting in February 2021 for the NICE submission (130).",

CodeBreak 100 specifically enrolled patients with KRAS G12C mutations, whereas SELECT-1 enrolled patients with KRAS mutations at codon 12, 13 or 61 (131). CodeBreak 100 enrolled patients with 1 to 3 prior therapies, whereas SELECT-1 included patients with 1 prior therapy. Both studies excluded subjects with active brain metastases although both permitted inclusion of stable brain metastases. The two studies reported PFS and OS as primary or secondary endpoints.

The distribution of patients between the two trials is similar in terms of age, disease stage and histology, and the majority of patients had ECOG/WHO performance status of 1.

In addition to differences in KRAS mutation status, CodeBreak 100 included patients taking 1-3 prior therapies and a high proportion of patients had prior use of PD(L)-1 inhibitors, reflecting the current treatment pathway for patients with KRAS G12C -mutated NSCLC in Denmark. In contrast, the SELECT-1 trial were conducted before the evidence base supported front-line use of immunotherapy, included patients taking 1 prior therapy only and no PD(L)-1 inhibitors.\nTable 56.

      "text": "Despite some differences between CodeBreak 100 and SELECT-1, UK clinical experts considered these were the best and most relevant sources of data available with which to make indirect comparisons for sotorasib in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC in the NICE submission. The data are considered adequate to reflect PFS and OS outcomes with sotorasib and placebo plus docetaxel following prior therapy in this population of patients. A propensity score weighted analysis approach such as MAIC requires the matching of prognostic patient characteristics to generate robust comparative treatment effect estimates. Due to missing data or other differences between the trials it would not be possible to match across all trials for KRAS G12C mutation status, brain metastases, prior lines of therapy or prior use of PD-L1 inhibitors. Given that PFS and OS outcomes are similar in the absence of targeted therapies, irrespective of KRAS status, the inability to match by specific KRAS status is unlikely to lead to biased estimates. Patients with brain metastases were excluded from SELECT-1 trial whereas CodeBreak 100 permitted enrolment of non-active brain metastases; however, as brain metastases are an important prognostic characteristic, the inclusion of patients with brain metastases in the CodeBreak 100 trial but not in the SELECT-1 trial may lead to conservative estimates of relative treatment effects for sotorasib. Although CodeBreak 100 included patients with 1-3 prior therapies, to match only patients with 1 prior therapy, as per SELECT-1 would effectively reduce the available CodeBreak 100 trial population by 57%, which would have significant implications for the precision of any relative treatment effect estimates. The inability to robustly match for number of prior lines of therapy or prior use of immunotherapy is therefore a potential limitation that arises due to limited comparator trial data specifically in KRAS-mutant NSCLC. However, PFS and OS outcomes are likely to be worse for patients with each successive line of therapy. Given that CodeBreak 100 included 57% of patients with 2 or more prior lines of therapy, a comparison of PFS and OS data from the whole of the CodeBreak 100 NSCLC population against PFS and OS data from patients in SELECT-1, who had received only one prior line of therapy, is likely to be conservative.\nMedicinrådet Dampfærgevej 27-29, 3. th. DK-2100 København Ø +45 70 10 36 00 medicinraadet@medicinraadet.dk\nOn balance, in the context of this rare disease with limited available comparator trial data, an indirect comparison using these data sources is feasible and appropriate. The patient population in SELECT-1 appears to be closely aligned with the CodeBreak 100 trial population. On this basis, any formal indirect comparison using propensity score weighting approaches, which requires matching of patient characteristics, a robust comparison is likely to be achieved using CodeBreak 100 and SELECT-1.

The following weighting and average baseline characteristics will be balanced for the sotorasib-treated patients and the docetaxel-treated patients. Weights will be derived using an MAIC, a form of propensity score weighting (132). The propensity score logistic regression model estimates the odds of being enrolled into the CodeBreak 100 trial or the SELECT-1 trial. For this, a method of moments will be used to allow a propensity score logistic regression model to be estimated without patient-level data for the comparative evidence sources. The model will be estimated on the basis of individual patient data available for the sotorasib-treated patients and the published summary data available for the SELECT-1 trial. Following estimation of the weights, it is necessary to explore their distribution. Re-scaled weights will be explored via the use of histograms to determine whether specific patient(s) or groups of patients (based on covariate values) will be over- or underrepresented in the analysis. The use of scaled weights aids interpretation; a scaled weight of > 1 means that an individual carries more weight in the re-weighted sample than in the original sample, and a scaled weight of < 1 means that an individual carries less weight.",

Likewise, robust standard errors were generated using the weighted Cox models.\nThe HR and corresponding 95% CI for the different MAIC models are presented in section 7.2.1.4. The base-case model for use in the cost-effectiveness analyses includes the following covariates: ECOG, disease stage and smoking status. The rationale is that this model includes all variables identified as at least somewhat important in the physician insights report, with the exception of PD-L1 expression and number of prior lines of therapy. These two variables are excluded on the basis that they lead to a significant reduction in the effective sample size.\nFurther rationale for excluding the PD-L1 protein expression is that PD-L1 expression was indicated to be a strong predictive factor for treatments with anti-PD- (L)1 only, as detailed in the physician’s insight report (76). Moreover, physicians mentioned three expression groups relevant to treatment decisions (<1%, 1-49%, >= 50%). In SELECT-1, however, aggregate data were presented for the expression groups <5% and ≥ 5% only; therefore, it was not possible to perform the matching based on the categories identified as relevant by the physicians.",

The following section outlines the key strengths and limitations of the MAIC analysis.\nMedicinrådet Dampfærgevej 27-29, 3. th. DK-2100 København Ø +45 70 10 36 00 medicinraadet@medicinraadet.dk\n• Both CodeBreak 100 and SELECT-1 had similar inclusion/exclusion criteria and had similar criteria for measuring PFS (both using RECIST 1.1 every 6 weeks), which lowers the risk of bias for this comparison. Key differences were the type of KRAS mutation (any for SELECT-1, G12C only for CodeBreak 100), and the type and number of prior lines of therapy (only one prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy for SELECT-1, between 1 and 3 prior lines of treatment for CodeBreak including an anti- PD-(L)1 AND/OR a platinum-based chemotherapy. • Current evidence and expert opinion suggest there is no difference in prognostic between KRAS G12C and other KRAS mutations, which limits the risk of bias (133-135) • CodeBreak 100 subsects were more heavily pre-treated than SELECT-1 subjects. This is a conservative limitation for the comparative effectiveness as a more heavily pre-treated population is generally associated with poorer clinical outcomes. • Most patients in CodeBreak 100 had received an anti-PD-(L)1 regimen in prior lines whereas no patient received it in SELECT-1. There is limited evidence that the use of anti-PD-1 therapies in prior lines can enhance the tumor response on subsequent chemotherapy (including docetaxel). However, so far, no significant difference has been found in terms of PFS or OS. • One limitation is that it was not possible to adjust on all key characteristics due to either a lack of overlap (KRAS G12C, anti-PD-1 in prior line, number of prior lines) or lack of data (% with controlled brain metastases, presence of other targetable mutations). • The presence of other targetable mutations is very low in CodeBreak 100 (3%) and expected to be very low as well in SELECT-1 as the presence of other targetable mutations is very rare in KRAS mutated patients. • The proportion of patients with controlled brain metastases (both trials excluded patients with active brain metastases) was not reported in SELECT-1 and was 21% in CodeBreak 100 pre-matching (18% post matching). The analysis is potentially conservative for the comparative efficacy of sotorasib vs. docetaxel in this regard, as the presence of brain metastases is a negative prognostic factor, whereas in other previously treated NSCLC RCTs, the proportion of patients with controlled brain metastases was consistently lower than in CodeBreak 100, suggesting there were potentially fewer patients with brain metastases in the SELECT-1 trial.\nMedicinrådet Dampfærgevej 27-29, 3. th.

The database identified NSCLC patients with a positive test for KRAS G12C mutation and recorded their treatment patterns and clinical outcomes. Although some patients (<20%) in the Phase II trial have not received an anti-PD-(L)1-based treatment in any previous line, it is expected that at the time of sotorasib launch, most patients eligible to receive sotorasib will have been treated with a prior anti PD-(L)1 therapy in the majority of countries. To reflect current and future practice, PD-1 therapy is not included and the treatment basket in the matched historical cohort included patients treated with chemotherapy only. The inclusion of the database was done to address the key limitations of the MAIC using the outcomes observed in real world practice and to help demonstrate the robustness of the analysis using an alternative approach.",

      "text": "The propensity score weighting analysis (PWSA) was conducted to qualitatively compare the benefit of sotorasib vs. chemotherapy-based standard of care treatments. The approach attempted to mimic the effect of randomization by creating a balance between the sotorasib treated and the chemotherapy-treated real-world patients with respect to important available baseline covariates that determine both the propensity for a patient to be treated (with the treatment under evaluation) and a patient’s prognosis. To m imic the treatment effect compared to a hypothetical comparator arm in the CodeBreak 100 trial, the ATT was calculated, assigning weights to the subjects in the comparator arm (Flatiron propensity weighting score analysis). The advantage of utilizing a propensity score analysis is to create a balance across multiple observed factors that are thought to affect prognosis between the sotorasib -treated subjects in the Phase II portion of CodeBreak 100 and a historical comparator arm comprised of patients from the FIH-FMI CGDB. Such a balance, if adequately achieved, would limit bias and thus reinforce the validity of a statistical comparison of the clinical outcomes of sotorasib treated subjects vs. patients treated with chemotherapy-based standard of care.\nDue to sample size restrictions, and based on clinical expertise, the comparator cohort captured 206 patients with any KRAS mutation; including 85 patients with KRAS G12C . The rationale for restricting this analysis to chemotherapy-based treatment was to achieve a comparison most relevant for future reimbursement situations. In particular, PD-(L)1 therapy was disregarded from the comparator arm, as it is normally used in 1L in current clinical practice (clinical advisory board (11 February 2011) conducted by Amgen (138). For validity assessment, a Cox regression model was also run where the comparator cohort was restricted to KRAS G12C patients only. The intention of this analysis was to demonstrate the consistency of the results with the KRAS-mutant cohort and to demonstrate the implications on stochastic uncertainty. Due to the small\nMedicinrådet Dampfærgevej 27-29, 3. th. DK-2100 København Ø +45 70 10 36 00 medicinraadet@medicinraadet.dk\neffective sample size of 17.8 patients in the comparator arm, the KRAS-p.G12C cohort was not suitable for parametric curve fitting. Similar to the MAIC analyses, data with DCO 15 March 2021 from the CodeBreak 100 trial were used. The Flatiron database covered the period from 01 January 2011 to 30 September 2020. To allow for a minimum follow up of 6 months, patients were included in the analysis if their index date (start date of selected line of therapy) was on or before 31 March 2020,",

For the exploratory ‘p.G12C - only’ analysis, the propensity score model included the same covariates as the ‘KRAS mutant’ analysis, plus BMI at baseline, and presence of liver metastases at baseline.

The analyses described in this report are based on the 15 th March 2021 data cut.\nPhase 2 of Study 20170543 was a single-arm clinical trial (with AMG 510 as monotherapy), where quality of life data was collected from subjects using the following patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs): EORTC QLQ- C30, EORTC QLQ-LC13, NSCLC SAQ, PGIC, PGIS, EQ-5D-5L, and PRO-CTCAE. Utilities for health states are required for health economic modelling; therefore, the overall objective of this analysis was to provide such estimates. Additional objectives were to explore utilities over time and within subgroups. Estimates in this report are based on Denmark-specific utilities.",
