      "text": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for up to 85% of all lung cancers. The last few years have seen the develop- ment of a new staging system, diagnostic procedures such as liquid biopsy, treatments like immunotherapy, as well as deeper molecular knowledge; so, more options can be offered to patients with driver mutations. Groups with specific treatments account for around 25% and demonstrate significant increases in overall survival, and in some subgroups, it is important to evaluate each treatment alternative in accordance with scientific evidence, and even more so with immunotherapy. New treatments similarly mean that we must reconsider what should be done in oligometastatic disease where local treatment attains greater value.\nKeywords NSCLC · Chemotherapy · Immunotherapy · Targeted therapies · Radiotherapy\n* 2 M.
