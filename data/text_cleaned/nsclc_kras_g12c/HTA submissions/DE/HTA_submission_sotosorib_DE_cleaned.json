      "text": "The pharmaceutical company submitted a dossier for the early benefit assessment of the active ingredient sotorasib (Lumykras) on 14 February 2022. For the resolution of 4 August\n2022 made by the G-BA in this procedure, a limitation up to 1 July 2023 was pronounced. At\nthe pharmaceutical company's request, this limitation was shortened until 1 February 2023 by the resolution of the G-BA of 5 January 2023.\nIn accordance with Section 4, paragraph 3, No. 5 Ordinance on the Benefit Assessment of\nPharmaceuticals (AM-NutzenV) in conjunction with Chapter 5 Section 8, paragraph 1, number\n5 VerfO, the procedure for the benefit assessment of the medicinal product Lumykras recommences when the deadline has expired.\nThe pharmaceutical company submitted the final dossier to the G-BA in accordance with\nSection 4, paragraph 3, number 5 of the Ordinance on the Benefit Assessment of\nPharmaceuticals (AM- NutzenV) in conjunction with Chapter 5 Section 8, paragraph 1, number\n5 VerfO on 31 January 2023. The G-BA commissioned the IQWiG to carry out the assessment\nof the dossier. The benefit assessment was published on 2 May 2023 on the G-BA website\ntherefore initiating the written statement procedure. In addition, an oral\nhearing was held.\nThe G-BA came to a resolution on whether an additional benefit of sotorasib compared to the appropriate comparator therapy could be determined on the basis of the dossier of the\npharmaceutical company, the dossier assessment prepared by the IQWiG and the statements submitted in the written statement and oral hearing procedure. In order to determine the\nextent of the additional benefit, the G-BA has evaluated the data justifying the finding of an additional benefit on the basis of their therapeutic relevance (qualitative), in accordance with\nthe criteria laid down in Chapter 5 Section 5, paragraph 7 VerfO. The methodology proposed\nby the IQWiG in accordance with the General Methods 1 was not used in the benefit assessment of sotorasib.\nIn the light of the above, and taking into account the statements received and the oral hearing, the G-BA has come to the following assessment:\n2.1 Additional benefit of the medicinal product in relation to the appropriate\ncomparator therapy\n2.1.1 Approved therapeutic indication of Sotorasib (Lumykras) in accordance with the\nproduct information\nLumykras as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS G12C mutation and who have progressed after at least one\nprior line of systemic therapy.\nTherapeutic indication of the resolution (resolution of 3 August 2023):\nsee the approved therapeutic indication",

As comparator therapy, medicinal products or non-medicinal treatments for which the\npatient-relevant benefit has already been determined by the G-BA shall be preferred.\n4. According to the generally recognised state of medical knowledge, the comparator\ntherapy should be part of the appropriate therapy in the therapeutic indication.\nJustification based on the criteria set out in Chapter 5 Section 6, paragraph 3 VerfO:\non 1. In terms of authorisation status, the active ingredients cisplatin, docetaxel, etoposide,\nifosfamide, mitomycin, paclitaxel, pemetrexed, vindesine, vinorelbine, afatinib, erlotinib, nintedanib, atezolizumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab and ramucirumab are\navailable for the treatment of advanced NSCLC.\nMedicinal products with an explicit marketing authorisation for the treatment of treatable mutations or for molecularly stratified therapy (directed against ALK, BRAF,\nEGFR, Exon-20, METex14, RET or ROS1) are not listed.\nApart from sotorasib, there are currently no other approved medicinal therapies that are explicitly used in adults with a KRAS p.G12C mutation.\non 2. For the present therapeutic indication, it is assumed that the patients have no\nindication for definitive local therapy. Therefore, a non-medicinal treatment cannot be\nconsidered in the present therapeutic indication.\non 3. For pretreated advanced NSCLC, resolutions of the G-BA on the benefit assessment of\nmedicinal products with new active ingredients according to Section 35a SGB V on the active ingredients afatinib, atezolizumab, nintedanib, nivolumab, pembrolizumab and\nramucirumab are available.\nMedicinal products with an explicit marketing authorisation for the treatment of treatable mutations or for molecularly stratified therapy (directed against ALK, BRAF,\nEGFR, Exon-20, METex14, RET or ROS1) are not listed.\nAnnex VI to Section K of the Pharmaceuticals Directive - Prescribability of approved medicinal products in non-approved therapeutic indications (off-label use):\nCarboplatin-containing medicinal products for advanced non-small cell lung cancer\n(NSCLC) - combination therapy on 4. The generally recognised state of medical knowledge was illustrated by a systematic\nsearch for guidelines as well as reviews of clinical studies in the present indication and is presented in the \"Research and synopsis of the evidence to determine the\nappropriate comparator therapy according to Section 35a SGB V\".\nThe scientific-medical societies and the Drugs Commission of the German Medical\nAssociation (AkdÄ) were also involved in writing on questions relating to the comparator therapy in the present indication according to Section 35a, paragraph 7\nSGB V.\nAmong the approved active ingredients listed under 1., only certain active ingredients\nwill be included in the appropriate comparator therapy, taking into account the\nevidence on therapeutic benefit, the guideline recommendations and the reality of health care provision.\nAt this time, it is assumed that no other molecularly stratified therapy (directed against\nALK, BRAF, EGFR, exon-20, METex14, RET or ROS1) will be considered for patients at the time of therapy with sotorasib. It should be noted that there is no higher quality\nevidence for the treatment of NSCLC related to the KRAS p.G12C mutation. So far, there\nare no other approved medicinal treatments besides sotorasib that are explicitly used in the presence of a KRAS p.G12C mutation according to the marketing authorisation.\nAccording to the scientific-medical societies involved and the European Public\nAssessment Report (EPAR), the treatment standards correspond to those of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer without specifically treatable oncogenic driver mutations.\nFor the present therapeutic indication, it is also assumed that the patients are generally eligible for active antineoplastic therapy, which is why best supportive care is not\nconsidered as an appropriate comparator therapy in the present case.\nIn the second-line treatment, depending on the first-line therapy, a distinction is made between a) patients with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody monotherapy pretreatment, b)\npatients with cytotoxic chemotherapy pretreatment and c) after first-line therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with a platinum-containing chemotherapy or after\nsequential therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and a platinum-containing chemotherapy as pretreatment. In the present procedure, patients with cytotoxic chemotherapy\npretreatment (patient group b) and patients after first-line therapy with an anti-PD-\n1/PD-L1 in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and platinum-containing chemotherapy (patient\ngroup c) are relevant.\nb) Following first-line therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy\nFor patients with NSCLC for whom further antineoplastic therapy is indicated after firstline chemotherapy, several treatment options are available on the basis of the available evidence with the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents docetaxel and pemetrexed, in\neach case as monotherapy, docetaxel in combination with nintedanib and the immune checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, partly only under\ncertain conditions.\nWith docetaxel and pemetrexed, both as monotherapy, two established chemotherapeutic agents are available for second-line chemotherapy, although\npemetrexed is unsuitable for predominantly squamous histology. For the combination\nof docetaxel and nintedanib, which is indicated for adenocarcinoma histology, an indication of a minor additional benefit was identified in the benefit assessment\ncompared to docetaxel monotherapy (resolution of 18 June 2015). In the guidelines,\ndocetaxel in combination with nintedanib is recommended alongside the other chemotherapy options, but is not regularly preferred over them. Based on the available\nevidence and corresponding therapy recommendations in the guidelines, docetaxel and pemetrexed, each as monotherapy, as well as docetaxel in combination with\nnintedanib, are considered therapeutically comparable, subject to tumour histology and the different side effect profile.\nFor nivolumab for the treatment of adults after prior chemotherapy and squamous tumour histology, an indication of a major additional benefit was identified in the\nbenefit assessment compared to docetaxel (resolution of 4 February 2016). For\nnivolumab for the treatment of adults after prior chemotherapy and non-squamous tumour histology, an indication of a major additional benefit was also identified in the\nbenefit assessment compared to docetaxel (resolution of 20 October 2016).\nFor pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, used after prior chemotherapy, the benefit assessment also found an indication of a major additional benefit compared to\ndocetaxel (pembrolizumab: resolution of 2 February 2017, atezolizumab: resolution of\n16 March 2018). According to the marketing authorisation for the present therapeutic\nindication, pembrolizumab is only indicated for patients with PD-L1 expressing tumours\n(TPS ≥ 1%).\nNivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab each lead to a significant prolongation in overall survival compared with docetaxel and also to a significant reduction in side\neffects. Accordingly, the guidelines regularly prefer immune checkpoint inhibitors over\ncytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. However, PD-L1 negative tumours are a\nfundamental exception. In these cases, the guidelines predominantly do not\nrecommend a regular preference of immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, in PD-L1 negative tumours, alternative cytotoxic\nchemotherapeutic agents are also determined as an appropriate comparator therapy for the immune checkpoint inhibitors.\nFor ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel, no additional benefit was shown in the benefit assessment compared to docetaxel (resolution of 1 September 2016).\nLikewise, no additional benefit was identified in the benefit assessment of afatinib compared to docetaxel (resolution of 20 October 2016). Taking into account that\nbenefit-assessed medicinal treatments with an additional benefit are available in the present indication, the treatment options ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel\nas well as afatinib, for which no additional benefit could be determined in each case, are not considered as an appropriate comparator therapy.\nIn the overall assessment, the G-BA determined docetaxel, pemetrexed, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab and docetaxel in combination with nintedanib as equally\nappropriate comparator therapies for this patient group. The additional benefit can be\ndemonstrated compared to one of the treatment options mentioned.\nThe appropriate comparator therapy determined here includes several therapeutic alternatives. In this context, individual therapeutic alternatives only represent a\ncomparator therapy for the part of the patient population that has the patient and disease characteristics specified in brackets. The therapeutic alternatives are only to be\nconsidered equally appropriate in the therapeutic indication, where the patient populations have the same characteristics.\nc) Following first-line therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with a platinum-containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti-PD-\n1/PD-L1 and a platinum-containing chemotherapy\nTh\ntre\nThe treatment setting addressed in the present case may include patients who have either already received a platinum-containing chemotherapy in combination with an\nanti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy as part of first-line therapy or have received a platinumcontaining chemotherapy and an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy sequentially in the first and second line of therapy (regardless of which of the therapies was administered first).\nFor both the treatment setting after platinum-containing chemotherapy in combination with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and for further treatment after sequential therapy\nwith a platinum-containing chemotherapy and an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in the first and second line of therapy, there is no higher-quality evidence based on clinical studies.\nAccording to the guidelines, patients in the present therapeutic indication are eligible for antineoplastic subsequent therapy, taking into account the prior therapy and\ntumour histology, with docetaxel, pemetrexed, docetaxel in combination with ramucirumab or nintedanib, erlotinib and afatinib being named as treatment options.\nThe recommendation of further therapy with a (different) anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 does not emerge from the available evidence.\nFor the combination of docetaxel and nintedanib, which is indicated for adenocarcinoma histology, an indication of a minor additional benefit was identified in\nthe benefit assessment compared to docetaxel monotherapy (resolution of 18 June\nFor ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel, no additional benefit was shown in the benefit assessment compared to docetaxel (resolution of 1 September 2016). The\nbenefit assessment showed no additional benefit for afatinib for the treatment of adults with squamous cell histology compared to the appropriate comparator therapy\ndocetaxel (resolution of 20 October 2016). With regard to the above-mentioned benefit\nassessments, however, it should be noted that they were based on the treatment setting of a second-line therapy after prior platinum-containing chemotherapy and\nthus, on an indication that deviated from the present treatment setting with regard to the prior therapy.\nOverall, in view of the limited evidence for the present treatment setting, the G-BA determined a patient-individual therapy as the appropriate comparator therapy, taking\ninto account the prior therapy and histology, selecting afatinib, pemetrexed, erlotinib, docetaxel, docetaxel in combination with ramucirumab and docetaxel in combination\nwith nintedanib as well as vinorelbine.\nThe specific appropriate comparator therapy comprises a selection of different active ingredients and combinations of active ingredients that can be considered for the\npresent therapeutic indication according to the authorisation status of the medicinal products and the recommendations in the guidelines.\nhe findings in Annex XII do not restrict the scope of treatment required to fulfil the medical eatment order.",

      "text": "In summary, the additional benefit of sotorasib is assessed as follows:\nb) Adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS p.G12C mutation after\nfirst-line therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy\nAn additional benefit is not proven.\nJustification:\nFor adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS p.G12C mutation after\nfirst-line therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy, the pharmaceutical company does not submit data for the assessment of additional benefit. Therefore, an additional benefit is not proven.\nc) Adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS p.G12C mutation after\nfirst-line therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and platinumcontaining chemotherapy\nc1) Adults for whom docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy\nHint of a non-quantifiable additional benefit.\nJustification:\nFor the proof of an additional benefit of sotorasib, the pharmaceutical company presents the still ongoing randomised, open-label and multicentre phase III CodeBreak 200 study\ncomparing sotorasib versus docetaxel. The study has been conducted in 148 study sites in\nAsia, Australia, Europe and North and South America since 2020.\nThe study enrolled adult patients with locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic NSCLC with molecularly diagnosed KRAS G12C mutation. Patients had to have disease progression\nduring or after at least 1 prior systemic therapy for advanced or unresectable stage of the disease. Prior therapy should include combined or sequential platinum-containing\ncombination chemotherapy and an anti-PD-1/PD-L1. A total of 334 (96.8%) patients in the\nstudy received prior treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and platinum-containing chemotherapy (in combination or sequentially). For enrolment in the study, patients should\nhave a general condition according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance\nStatus (ECOG-PS) ≤ 1, no relevant limitations in renal and liver function and no haematological limitations.\nThe total of 345 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either treatment with sotorasib (N\n= 171) or docetaxel (N = 174), stratified by number of prior lines of therapy in advanced stage of the disease (1 vs 2 vs > 2), descent (Asian vs non-Asian) and brain metastases at the time of\nrandomisation (yes vs no).\nThe treatment with sotorasib or docetaxel complied with the specifications of the product information with restrictions regarding a renewed intake of sotorasib after vomiting or\nregarding a permitted dose reduction of docetaxel to 55 mg/m2body surface area and, if required, a second dose reduction to 37.5 mg/m2 body surface area during the course of the\nstudy. Treatment with study medication continued until disease progression, intolerance of\ntreatment, initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up or death. If certain criteria were met according to the principal investigator's assessment, further\ntreatment with sotorasib or docetaxel was possible even after disease progression. Under\ncertain conditions, e.g. the patients were not allowed to have started any other cancer\ntherapy, a change of therapy from docetaxel to sotorasib was possible at the doctor's discretion.\nThe primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival according to a blinded, independent central review. Other patient-relevant endpoints included overall survival and\nendpoints on symptomatology and health status. In addition, endpoints of the categories\nhealth-related quality of life and side effects were collected.\nThe pharmaceutical company presents results of the 1st data cut-off from 02.08.2022.\nImplementation of the appropriate comparator therapy\nThe CodeBreak 200 study presented is a single-comparator study in which all patients in the comparator arm received docetaxel as monotherapy. Thus, the CodeBreak 200 study does\nnot implement the appropriate comparator therapy, which provides for a patient-individual selection from several named treatment options. In the submitted dossier and in the context\nof the statement, the pharmaceutical company justifies the choice of docetaxel with advantages over the other options of the appropriate comparator therapy, in particular\ndocetaxel in combination with ramucirumab or docetaxel in combination with nintedanib, and additionally cites the lack of global availability of individual therapy options.\nWithin the framework of the written statement procedure, the scientific-medical societies describe the therapy of pretreated NSCLC with docetaxel as a particularly relevant therapeutic\nalternative in view of the previous therapy for patients without contraindications. The other\ntherapy options included in the appropriate comparator therapy play a particularly relevant therapeutic alternative. The other therapeutic alternative included in the appropriate\ncomparator therapy also play a role.\nEven taking into account the statements, the G-BA considers the CodeBreak 200 study as a whole to be a sufficiently suitable evidence base to make an assessment with regard to the\nsub-population of patients for whom docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy.\nConsequently, a separate assessment is made for patients for whom docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy (patient group c1)) and patients for whom a therapy\nother than docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy (patient group c2)).\nExtent and probability of the additional benefit c1) Adults for whom docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy\nHint for a non-quantifiable additional benefit\nMortality\nThe endpoint of overall survival was defined in the CodeBreak 200 study as the time from the date of randomisation to death from any cause. There is no statistically significant difference\nbetween the treatment arms here.\nWith regard to overall survival, an additional benefit of sotorasib compared to docetaxel is therefore not proven.\nMorbidity\nProgression-free survival (PFS)\nProgression-free survival (PFS) is defined in the study as the time from the date of randomisation until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first.\nFor the PFS, there is a statistically significant difference to the advantage of sotorasib compared to docetaxel.\nThe PFS endpoint is a combined endpoint composed of endpoints of the mortality and morbidity categories. The endpoint component of mortality is already assessed via the\nendpoint of overall survival as an independent endpoint. The morbidity component is\nassessed according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1) and thus predominantly by means of\nimaging procedures. Taking into account the aspects mentioned above, there are different\nopinions within the G-BA regarding the patient-relevance of the endpoint PFS. The overall\nstatement on the extent of the additional benefit remains unaffected.\nProgression of central nervous system (CNS) metastases\nThe endpoint of progression in the CNS is defined in the CodeBreak 200 study as the time from randomisation to radiological evidence of disease progression in the CNS (endpoint\nassessment only for patients who already had CNS disease at the time of enrolment in the study). The assessment is based solely on imaging procedures and does not take into account\nthe symptomatology perceived by patients. Thus, the endpoint is not directly patient-relevant\nand is not presented. In addition, only patients who already had CNS disease at the time of\nenrolment in the study were included in the analysis. Patients without previous CNS disease\nor with first-time occurrence of CNS metastases were not included in the evaluation.\nCross-endpoint assessment of patient-reported endpoints (PRO) data:\nWith regard to the endpoints assessed in the CodeBreak 200 study using the EORTC QLQ-C30,\nEORTC QLQ-LC13, BPI-SF, FACT-G GP5, and PGI-C questionnaires, IQWiG noted in the addendum to the dossier assessment that there was a differential percentage of patients\nincluded in the evaluation between the treatment arms for all corresponding endpoints of >\n15 percentage points each, which is why IQWiG assessed the data as unsuitable overall. For\nthe present assessment, the results for the respective endpoints, in particular the effect estimator, the confidence interval and the percentage of patients included in the evaluation\nin the treatment arms, are also taken into account in order to assess the extent to which these data are suitable or completely unsuitable for deriving statements on the additional benefit.\nSymptomatology\nIn the endpoint category of morbidity, the CodeBreak 200 study recorded symptomatology using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC-13 questionnaires, the endpoints of worst pain and\nimpairment due to pain using BPI-SF items 3 and 9a-g, respectively, and the endpoint of therapy burden using the single item GP5 from the FACT-G questionnaire.\nHealth status\nIn the CodeBreak 200 study, health status was assessed both with the PGI-C questionnaire\n(change in physical condition via the symptoms of cough, chest pain and shortness of breath) and via the EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS). With regard to the evaluations of the VAS of\nthe EQ-5D, a statistically significant difference to the advantage of sotorasib over docetaxel is shown for the endpoint of health status.\nSymptomatology\nAs a result of the above assessment of the data, the present assessment assumes an overall positive effect of sotorasib on symptomatology compared to docetaxel. This assessment is\nsupported by the consistent and, in some cases, very significant effects on several endpoints on symptomatology as well as the statistically significant difference to the advantage of\nsotorasib in the endpoint of health status (EQ-5D VAS). Notwithstanding the fact that the\ndifferential percentage of > 15 percentage points per se results in a high risk of bias and a resulting large uncertainty, an overall advantage can thus be derived for sotorasib with regard\nto symptomatology.\nConclusion on morbidity endpoints:\nIn the overall analysis of the results, an advantage of sotorasib can be determined with regard to morbidity, the extent of which cannot be quantified.\nHealth-related quality of life\nThe health-related quality of life of the patients in the CodeBreak 200 study is assessed using the functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. As a result of the above\nassessment of the data, the large uncertainty predominates based on a weighing of the extent of the differential percentage of patients included in the treatment arms in the evaluation and\nthe magnitude of the effects on the quality of life endpoints. Therefore, an effect on the\noverall quality of life cannot be assumed with sufficient certainty. The result is that the data\nare not assessable.\nSide effects\nAdverse events (AEs) in total\nIn the CodeBreak 200 study, AEs occurred in both treatment arms in almost all study participants. The results were only presented additionally.\nSerious AEs (SAEs), severe AEs and discontinuation due to AEs\nThere is no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms for each of the endpoints of SAEs, severe AEs and discontinuation due to AEs.\nSpecific AEs\nInterstitial lung disease (severe AE)\nThere was no statistically significant differences between the treatment arms for the specific\nAE of interstitial lung disease.\nLiver disorders (severe AEs)\nFor the specific AE of liver disorders (severe AEs), there is a statistically significant difference to the disadvantage of sotorasib versus docetaxel.\nOther specific AEs\nFor the specific AEs of stomatitis (AE), peripheral oedema (AE), peripheral neuropathy (AE), alopecia (AE), blood and lymphatic system disorders (AE), fatigue (AE), fever (AE) and\ninfections and infestations (AE), there was a statistically significant difference to the advantage of sotorasib versus docetaxel.\nFor the specific AE of chest pain (AE) and diarrhoea (AE), there was a statistically significant difference to the disadvantage of sotorasib versus docetaxel.\nFor the AEs of fever (AE) and infections and infestations (AE), there is an effect modification by the age characteristic in each case. With regard to the AE of fever, there was a statistically\nsignificant difference for patients < 65 years of age to the advantage of sotorasib, whereas for patients ≥ 65 years of age there was no statistically significant difference between the\ntreatment arms. With regard to the AE of infections and infestations (AE), there was a\nstatistically significant difference for patients ≥ 65 years of age to the advantage of sotorasib, whereas for patients < 65 years of age there was no statistically significant difference between\nthe treatment arms.\nThis effect modification is not evident in other endpoints. Overall, the significance of the\navailable subgroup results is considered insufficient for the assessment of the additional benefit.\nPatient-reported Outcome - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE)\nIn the CodeBreak 200 study, side effects were also recorded with the PRO-CTCAE instrument.\nHowever, it is not clear from the available documents on what basis the events were selected from the PRO-CTCAE system. More detailed information on the procedure was not provided\nby the pharmaceutical company. It is also not possible to tell whether the side effects of\nsotorasib and docetaxel are adequately shown. Overall, the results of the PRO-CTCAE cannot\nbe used.\nIn the overall assessment of the results on side effects, neither an advantage nor a disadvantage for treatment with sotorasib compared to docetaxel can be found.\nOverall assessment/ conclusion\nFor the assessment of the additional benefit of sotorasib in adults with advanced NSCLC with\nKRAS p.G12C mutation after first-line therapy with an anti-PD 1/PD-L1 in combination with\nplatinum-containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti-PD 1/PD-L1 and platinum-containing chemotherapy, results on mortality, morbidity, health-related quality of\nlife and side effects are available from the open-label, randomised, controlled phase III\nCodeBreak 200 study.\nIn the CodeBreak 200 study, sotorasib was compared to docetaxel.\nFor the endpoint of overall survival, no statistically significant difference was detected between the treatment arms.\nWith regard to the endpoints of symptomatology and health status, which were assessed in the CodeBreak 200 study by means of the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-LC13, BPI-SF, FACT-G\nGP5, and PGI-C questionnaires, there are uncertainties resulting from the differential percentage of patients of > 15 percentage points included in the evaluations between the\ntreatment arms. With regard to the evaluations of the EQ-5D VAS, there is a statistically\nsignificant difference for the endpoint of health status to the advantage of sotorasib over docetaxel. In the overall analysis of the results, an advantage of sotorasib can be determined\nwith regard to morbidity, the extent of which cannot be quantified.\nNo assessable data are available for the endpoint category of health-related quality of life assessed using the functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire.\nIn the overall assessment of the results on side effects, neither an advantage nor a disadvantage for treatment with sotorasib compared to docetaxel can be found.\nIn the overall assessment, therefore, a non-quantifiable additional benefit over docetaxel is identified for sotorasib as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with advanced NSCLC with\nKRAS p.G12C mutation after first-line therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with\nplatinum-containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and platinum-containing chemotherapy for which docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual\ntherapy.\nReliability of data (probability of additional benefit)\nThe present benefit assessment is based on the results of the randomised, open-label phase\nIII CodeBreak 200 study.\nThe risk of bias across endpoints at the study level is rated as generally low for the CodeBreak\n200 study. However, there are uncertainties regarding the implementation of the criteria\nspecified in the context of the appropriate comparator therapy for the treatment decision for the use of docetaxel as an appropriate patient-individual therapeutic alternative.\nThe risk of bias of the results for the endpoint of overall survival is rated as high. This is justified\nby the high percentage of patients who switch from the docetaxel arm to the sotorasib arm during the course of the study and due to the unclear percentage of censoring at the start of\nthe study.\nAt the endpoint level of the endpoint category of side effects and for the endpoint of health status, the risk of bias is classified as high due to the differential percentages of patients\nincluded in the evaluations between the treatment arms.\nFor the endpoints of health status, discontinuation due to AEs, non-severe and non-serious specific AEs, the lack of blinding additionally contributes to the high risk of bias of the results.\nOverall, a hint is derived for the reliability of data of the additional benefit identified.\nc2) Adults for whom a therapy other than docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy\nAn additional benefit is not proven.\nJustification\nFor the sub-population of adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS p.G12C mutation after first-line therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with\nplatinum-containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and platinum-containing chemotherapy and for whom a therapy other than docetaxel is the\nappropriate patient-individual therapy, no statements on the additional benefit can be made taking into account the CodeBreak 200 study. Since only results with a comparison to\ndocetaxel were presented for the benefit assessment, no usable data are available overall. An\nadditional benefit of sotorasib is therefore not proven for sub-population c2).",
