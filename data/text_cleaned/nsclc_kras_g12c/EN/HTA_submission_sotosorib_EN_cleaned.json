The results suggest that, after platinum-based chemotherapy, sotorasib increases the time before the cancer gets worse and how long people live compared with current treatment.\nSotorasib likely meets NICE's criteria to be a life-extending treatment at the end of life. But there is uncertainty in the clinical evidence. Sotorasib has the potential to be cost effective, but more evidence is needed to address the uncertainties before it can be recommended for routine use.\nThe evidence on sotorasib is promising. But, more data is being collected from the primary clinical trial and from an ongoing randomised controlled trial comparing sotorasib with docetaxel. Collecting additional data through the Cancer Drugs Fund may resolve some uncertainty in the clinical evidence. So, sotorasib is recommended for use in the Cancer Drugs Fund.\n© NICE 2024.

Some covariates identified as 'very important' by clinical experts were excluded from matching by the company because of missing data or trial differences. The ERG noted that excluding brain metastases affected prognosis identified by subgroup analysis. The company mentioned that active brain metastasis was excluded from the trials. The proportion of people with brain metastases was higher in CodeBreaK100 than in LUME-Lung 1. The company stated that if the proportion of inactive brain metastases in SELECT-1 was similar to CodeBreaK100, any bias would favour the docetaxel arm and result in conservative results. The ERG highlighted that an analysis including KRAS mutation status would be informative. But, it acknowledged the company's reasoning that overall survival and progression-free survival are similar in the absence of targeted therapies in the overall KRAS and KRAS G12C-specific population. However, it explained that it could have been possible to select KRAS G12C mutation data from SELECT-1 data. The ERG considered that the company's supplementary analysis using a PSWA may be less biased than the MAIC. It explained that the Amgen Flatiron Health real-world evidence data was adjusted to make it more comparable to the CodeBreaK100 population, and that there was little difference in the effective sample size compared with the MAIC. It also noted that the PSWA was adjusted for 13 covariates including brain metastases. However, the ERG highlighted that there remains considerable uncertainty in this approach. It noted that a PSWA limited to docetaxel-only data from the Flatiron study would have been informative. The committee agreed that using SELECT-1 instead of LUME-Lung 1 for the unanchored MAIC was appropriate. This is because the trial population was more comparable to CodeBreaK100, and it is also a more recent trial.

This was because a company-sourced UK advisory board confirmed that a MAIC was 'unlikely to be appropriate'. The ERG highlighted the uncertainty with not applying adjustments to ECOG, WHO or smoking status when these differed in SELECT-1 and LUME-Lung 1. It also mentioned that the model's overall survival curve was not in line with the Kaplan–Meier curve in LUME-Lung 1, with an unlikely major increase in mortality in the first 6 months. That is, the modelling implied a worse survival for docetaxel plus nintedanib compared with docetaxel alone. The Kaplan–Meier curve showed a slight benefit of docetaxel compared with docetaxel plus nintedanib in the first 4 months, which then transformed into a greater than 1 year survival benefit for docetaxel in the modelled overall survival curves. The clinical expert mentioned that in clinical practice, docetaxel is not expected to be better than docetaxel plus nintedanib in the first 6 months. The clinical expert also highlighted that nintedanib has greater toxicity so more people may stop treatment earlier, but added that this is unlikely to be a major driver. The company suggested a possible explanation of the curve could be that nintedanib is anti-angiogenic, so it prevents the formation of blood vessels that support tumour growth. Therefore, it can take more time to have an effect and possibly explain the delay in survival. In addition, the ERG suggested using 1 cut-off point at 6 months rather than 2 at 6 and 26 months because this did not show a good fit. Therefore, the ERG preferred a hazard ratio of 1 between 0 to 6 months. The company disagreed with invalidating LUME-Lung-1, a 2-arm phase 3 trial.

From the CodeBreaK100 March 2021 data-cut, 81.7% of people had discontinued treatment, about 40% were alive and about 20% had not yet progressed. The company stated that half the people who were alive will have kept taking sotorasib at that point. Because sotorasib is taken until progression or unacceptable toxicity in CodeBreaK100, applying treatment effect waning could lead to biased cost-effectiveness estimates. The clinical expert suggested that it was difficult to know how the treatment effect waning should be applied for sotorasib. However, they suggested that sotorasib should be considered in a similar way to other oral treatments for NSCLC. The clinical lead for the Cancer Drugs Fund referred to an example of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors showing high response rates. They noted that the disease can progress and people remain relatively well for some time before having symptoms. The clinical expert agreed with this. The company highlighted that sotorasib is not a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and that its mechanism of action and response rate would be different. The ERG disagreed with the company's assumption that sotorasib would have a continued benefit and highlighted that the evidence is still immature. In its base case, the ERG preferred to apply treatment effect waning at 2 years and gradually decrease the hazard ratio to 1 over 5 years. This was considered optimistic by the ERG. In addition, the ERG carried out additional scenario analyses with treatment effect waning at 3 and 5 years after starting treatment with no gradual decrease in the hazard ratio. This is in line with some other NSCLC appraisals. The committee noted that no direct trial evidence after the latest follow up at 15 months means that the treatment effect beyond this period is uncertain.

This was because the ERG said that the time-to-death utilities did not seem well informed and they were comprised of a small sample size, especially near death. The committee understood that the health-related quality of life data was from the September 2020 data-cut, therefore it was more immature. The ERG noted that the health-state utility approach means that each health state is populated with more people. The committee noted that for a health- state utility approach, the proportion of people in the progressed state that are closer to death are not apparent because averages are taken. The clinical expert highlighted that people need to be well enough to assess quality of life after progression. Therefore, the average is more likely representing people who recently stopped treatment. The committee considered that if a randomised controlled trial was done, the health-related quality of life in both arms should be the same at the start of treatment. Therefore, this may need to be considered in the approach to modelling health-related quality of life in the future. The company mentioned that it is open to using health-state utilities if there is a difference for sotorasib compared with chemotherapy after progression.

The ERG said it was not opposed to a treatment-related disutility for intravenous administration but highlighted the lack of justification for the size of disutility. It also considered the exclusion of any potential disutility associated with sotorasib dosing and frequency as an issue. This is because sotorasib is taken as 8 tablets once a day compared with docetaxel that is administered intravenously once every 3 weeks. In its submission, the company assumed equal on-treatment progression-free survival utilities for a targeted therapy compared with chemotherapy. It acknowledged that a differential is seen in other NICE appraisals. The company identified a progression-free survival utility of 0.687 from LUME-Lung 1, resulting in a decrement of 0.047 after applying the progression-free survival base-case utility. As a result, the company determined that scenarios with a health-state utility approach and either 0.025 or 0.04 progression-free survival on-treatment utility differential were appropriate to explore.

The committee discussed the arrangements for the Cancer Drugs Fund agreed by NICE and NHS England in 2016, noting NICE's Cancer Drugs Fund methods guide (addendum). The company has expressed an interest in the technology being considered for funding through the Cancer Drugs Fund. The clinical lead for the Cancer Drugs Fund mentioned that sotorasib needs to have plausible potential to be cost effective. The committee acknowledged that some of the clinical uncertainty may be addressed by collecting data on sotorasib through the Cancer Drugs Fund. The company explained that the phase 3 CodeBreaK200 trial, comparing sotorasib with docetaxel in a KRAS G12C mutation-positive population, is currently ongoing. It stated that this trial will measure overall and progression-free survival, and health-related quality of life. It will also collect data from people with previously treated disease. The committee agreed that some uncertainty may be resolved with data from the CodeBreak200 trial. The committee recalled its conclusion that the current cost-effectiveness results were highly uncertain. It agreed that, with longer follow-up data from CodeBreaK100 on mean overall and progression-free survival, and direct comparative evidence with docetaxel from CodeBreaK200, sotorasib has the potential to be cost effective. Also, that additional evidence may change the preferred modelling assumptions outlined in section 3.13. The committee concluded that sotorasib met the criteria to be considered for inclusion in the Cancer Drugs Fund. So, it recommended sotorasib for use within the\n© NICE 2024. All rights reserved.

This means that, if a patient has previously treated KRAS G12C mutation-positive advanced NSCLC and the doctor responsible for their care thinks that sotorasib is the right treatment, it should be available for use, in line with NICE's recommendations and the Cancer Drugs Fund criteria in the managed access agreement. Further information can be found in NHS England's Appraisal and funding of cancer drugs from July 2016 (including the new Cancer Drugs Fund) – A new deal for patients, taxpayers and industry.\nChapter 2 of Appraisal and funding of cancer drugs from July 2016 4.2 (including the new Cancer Drugs Fund) – A new deal for patients, taxpayers and industry states that for those drugs with a draft recommendation for use in the Cancer Drugs Fund, interim funding will be available (from the overall Cancer Drugs Fund budget) from the point of marketing authorisation, or from release of positive draft guidance, whichever is later. Drugs that are recommended for use in the Cancer Drugs Fund will be funded in line with the terms of their managed access agreement, after the period of interim funding. The NHS England and NHS Improvement Cancer Drugs Fund list provides up-to-date information on all cancer treatments recommended by NICE since 2016. This includes whether they have received a marketing authorisation and been launched in the UK.\nThe Welsh ministers have issued directions to the NHS in Wales on 4.3 implementing NICE technology appraisal guidance when the drug or treatment, or other technology, is approved for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund. When a NICE technology appraisal recommends the use of a drug or treatment, or other technology, for use within the Cancer Drugs Fund, the NHS in Wales must usually provide funding and resources for it within 2 months of the first publication of the final appraisal document or agreement of a managed access agreement by the NHS in Wales, whichever is the later.\n© NICE 2024.
