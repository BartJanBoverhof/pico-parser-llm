      "text": "The evaluation concerns the reimbursement of sotorasibu in the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NDRP) with the presence of a p.G12C mutation in the KRAS gene (English: Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) who have not received at least one prior line of treatment in an existing treatment program B.6 Correct treatment for lung cancers (ICD-10: C34) and interstitial optic cancer (ICD-10:C45) . Currently, there is no targeted therapy for the mutation KRAS G12C, and patients are receiving treatment in the program B6. In comparison with docetaxel (NIN+DOC) and chemotherapy based on two platinum derivatives (P-CTH), it has been demonstrated that docetaxal and pemetrexed used as monotherapy have comparable efficacy. Taking into account the results of clinical analyses, the use of sotorasibu in patients with NDRP and KRAS mutation may be more effective compared to DOC in terms of, for example, survival without progression (PFS), overall response to treatment (ORR), disease control index (RDC) or quality of life. However, there are no statistically significant differences between the two therapies in the overall survival rate (OSR). However, there are no statistically significant differences between the therapies in terms of overall survival (OS). Clinical analysis does not provide evidence enabling direct comparison of the evaluated technologies with the majority of comparators, i.e. nintedanibem in combination with docetakselem (NIN+DOC), chemotherapy with a two-way split of platinum derivative (P-CTH), pemetrexed (PMX) are currently the most commonly used therapeutic options in these indications. According to the economic analysis of the incremental cost usefulness index (ICUR) from the perspective of the NFZ, there is a high probability of profitability, which is due to the fact that according to the analysis, the impact on the budget, reimbursement of the Lumykras drug, production of public expenditures, can vary between October I and October II of the recession. Guidelines indicate the possibility of applying the drug in the second line treatment of patients with NDRP mutation KRAS G12C (PTOK 2022, ESMO 2023, NCCN 2023 v2). Taking into account the opinion of the Council of Elders and the potential health benefits, the President of the Agency suggests the possible reimbursement of the Lumniykrascic (sotorasib) therapeutic product in the existing cancer treatment program in the new cancer group without any further conditions.",

      "text": "The term lung cancer (code C34 according to classification ICD-10) describes a group of cancers localized in the bronchi (dróg oddechowych) and miąższu płucnym. Two typical symptoms include: ograniczenie wydolności oddechowej lub duszność, ból w klatce piersiowej, krwioplucie lub częste zapalenia płuc. Pierwotny rak płuca is a tumor originating from komórek nabłonkowych. The most commonly recognized are 4 histological types: • gruczołowy rak (45% - wzrost częstości w ostatnim okresie); • rak płonabłonkowy (30%); • drobnokomkowy rak (15%); • wielkokomorkowy Rak (10%). Drobnomrokomnokomrokowy rak (DRP) differs from other types of tumors due to its biological and clinical characteristics (dementia, proliferative disease, exceptional chemotherapeutic indications, and increased prevalence of chronic diseases). NDRP differs from other histological types in that it develops more slowly and is characterized by limited chemical sensitivity. Mutations in the EGFR gene, ALK gene rearrangement and mutations in ROS1 gene are considered molecular changes of clinical significance. Lung cancer is the most frequently occurring cancer in Poland and the first cause of cancer deaths. In men and women, all deaths caused by cancer (in 2018 - respectively about 16 000 and 8 000 deaths). In 2020 74,5 thousand patients with lung cancer were recorded 26 thousand deaths. The overall 5-year survival rate is ~ 10% of patients, in whom diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (operated and non-operated łącznie).

      "text": "Sotorasib is a selective, inhibitor of KRAS G12C (homolog of viral oncogene mięsaka szczura Kirsten), which is co-inactivated and non-reversibly associated with the specific cysteine KRASG12C. Inactivation of KRasG12c by sotorasibe blocks the signaling and survival of cancer cells, inhibits cell growth, and selectively induces apoptosis in cells containing a mutation in KRas G12c, a factor that stimulates oncogenesis. The evaluation of efficacy (clinical and practical) and safety consists of the collection of data on the health consequences (effectiveness and safety) resulting from the use of a new therapy in a given health problem and other therapies which at a given time are financed from public funds and constitute an alternative treatment available in a particular health problem. A subsequent evaluation requires the determination of the reliability of the collected data and the comparison of the results concerning the efficacy and safety of the new therapy with respect to therapeutic treatments already available for the treatment of the given health issue. On the basis of this evaluation, the effectiveness or safety assessment must provide an answer to the question about the magnitude of the health effect (equivalent efficacy, safety and safety), which should be taken into account when considering the choice of another therapy. The efficacy and safety assessment of sotorasibu (SOT) used in the treatment of adult patients with non-robot colorectal cancer (NDRP) with KRAS G12C mutation was based on a clinical analysis involving randomized fourth-stage III studies: • CodeBreaK 200  evaluation of the efficacy or safety of Sotorasib in comparison with docetaxel (DOC).  number of patients: 171, DOC 174; median observation: 17.7  Celem portion of the proposed technological comparator (n = SOZ in zetaxel, chemotherapy or optical therapy) was 100  i/ ii, compared with the placebo-controlled clinical studies:  I/ II,  code of efficacy. • CodeBreaK 100  I/ II phase, randomized, evaluation of the efficacy and safety of the use of sotorasibu (SOT. number of patients: phase I 48, phase II 126; median observation period: phase II: 15.3 months.

      "text": "Economic evaluation, including estimation of the costs of the health effects obtained The economic evaluation consists in estimating and allocating the costs and health effects which may be associated with the use by an individual patient of a new therapy instead of a therapy already reimbursed. The costs of therapy are estimated in terms of our country's currency, while health effects are most often expressed in the number of years of life (LYG, life years gained) or in the length of life lived in full health (QALY, quality adjusted life years) as a result of the use of therapy. Estimation of values concerning the cost and effects related to the application of new therapy and comparison of their cost and effect of therapies already repaid after obtaining a satisfactory answer to the question, What is the effect of a single treatment on a patient's health? The maximum cost of a new therapy, which may be related to the best individual health effect (1 LYG or 1 QALY) of the two already available therapies, should not exceed three times the PKB per capita. The current projected cost-effectiveness is 175 926 PLN/QALY (3 58 x 642 PLN). The total cost of health care services is estimated at no more than a lifetime and can only be assessed by doctors on the basis of the therapeutic relationship. It does not determine the value of life, it can only evaluate the quality of life on the basis of the choice of therapy associated with the potentially best. An analysis of the usefulness of costs (CUA) in the life time horizon from the perspective of the public payer is carried out by the entities obliged to finance services from public funds, i.e. the National Health Fund (NFZ) and the Common Fund (pacjenta).

U. z 2022 r. poz. 2555 z późn. zm.) Jeżeli analiza kliniczna wnioskodawcy nie zawiera losowanych badań klinicznych dowodzących wyższości nad medami technologicznymi dotychczas rewanymi kosztami zdrowia, to urdowozędowa cenaby sztupowania leku musi być wprowadzona w taki sposób, aby wyższe koszty leku wyższego zastosowania technologii zdrowotnej były obniżone, to the extent that the cost of the application of the medicinal product was not significantly reduced by the effect of the use of the technology, the clinical evaluation of the proposal shall be carried out in accordance with the procedure provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article. The evaluation of the impact on the healthcare system, including on the public budget, consists of two main parts. Firstly, in the analysis of the budgetary impact, it is possible to estimate the potential expenditures associated with the financing of new therapies from public funds. The estimates of the costs associated with new therapy (scenario jutro) are based on the fact that we are currently experiencing a serious health problem (health scenario dziśliwa). The evaluation of the impact on the health care system in the second part addresses the question of how the decision to finance a new therapy may affect the organization of the provision of services (particularly in the context of adapting the requirements for the implementation of a new treatment) and the availability of other health care services. The results of the analysis of the effect on the budget of the proposal were presented in the last hourly timeframe from the perspective of the public health service (ZNF) and from the shared patient perspective (zNF + W). Wyniki basic analysis indicates that the reimbursement of the Lumykras medicinal product will be associated with public expenditures of approximately: • in I year, • in II year reimbursability. The reimbursment of the lumykras to Koszty sotorasibu treatment will vary depending on the number of patients using the proposed technology in the current scenario. In addition, the analysis of the sensitivity of the variation in the amount of the budgetary impact of the analysis does not take into account all the indicated comparators for the proposed technologies. Also indicate uncertainty regarding the likelihood of the population that would use the proposed therapy, as well as the predicted proportions of those affected. These values were based on, among others, the opinions of clinical experts. The actual number of patients with the presence of the p.G12C mutation in the KRAS gene is unknown at the current frequency of genetic testing among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NDRP). The cost of additional genetic testing in the case of obtaining a reimbursement is also covered by public expenditures. The limited reliability also affects the limited clinical and economic analysis. Attention should be paid to the proposed instrument for the determination of potential risks.",

One of the experts pointed out that the decision on the non-inclusion of a patient in the treatment programme due to the co-occurrence of other tumours should be taken by the doctor. The record of the exclusion of co-existence of other tumors is one of the eligibility criteria for the analyzed treatment programme. The subject of the rationalisation analysis is to identify the mechanism, the introduction of which will result in the release of public funds in an amount corresponding to at least the increase in costs resulting from the adoption of a positive decision on reimbursement of the requested technological measure. In the preliminary rationalization analysis, the applicant proposed a solution consisting in the omission of recommendations issued in other countries with respect to the evaluated technology. There were 3 clinical recommendations related to the proposed indication issued by: • Polskie Towarzystwo Onkologii Klinicznej (PTOK 2022); • National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN 2023 v2). • European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO 2023).

In this group, consideration may be given to the use of chemotherapy (docetaksel or pemetrexed), docetakselu in the treatment of nintedanibem, EGFR inhibitors in patients who have not received these medications in the first line, or ozymertynibu in patients previously treated with first-generation EGFR blockers, ALK inhibitors for the detection of ALK gene reactions, immunoassay (niwolumab or atezolizumab), palliative radiotherapy or progressive symptoms. Positive recommendations NICE 2022 restricts the use of Lumykras only within the framework of the funduszu walki z rakiem (English: Cancer Drugs Fund). The provision of data from the CodeBreaK100 and CodeBreakK200 studies can reduce uncertainty in the scope of estimates concerning the cost-effectiveness. Positive Recommendations are conditioned by the need to obtain a positive opinion on the provision of final results of studies for sotorasib. In negative decisions, attention is drawn to uncertainties in the analysis of the effectiveness and usefulness of the costs. According to information presented by the applicant, LUMykras (sotorasib) is financed in the EU and EFTA (to 30 indications).",
