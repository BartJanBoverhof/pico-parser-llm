      "text": "Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide (excluding non-melanocytic skin neoplasms) and a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Globally, only 18% of patients will survive 5 years or more after diagnosis of the disease. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage (not curable), because the incidence and mortality rates are very similar. Lung cancer usually is diagnosed after the age of 65 years, with a median age of diagnosis around 70 years. Tobacco is still the main risk factor, causing 85 to 90% of lung cancer cases. In countries that have implemented effective anti-tobacco measures, the rate of new cases of lung cancers is decreasing over the male sex (as is the case with a decreased incidence of carcinoma type 1 in women) and has not reached such a high level in some countries, although this is not the case in Europe. A decrease in the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma has reached a plateau in women; although this does not occur in some countries of southern Europe. A WHO estimate that in Portugal were diagnosed in 2020 5284 new cases of lung cancer, representing a third neoplasia most frequent in the country (fourth in women). An estimated prevalence of the disease over a period of 5 years is 5 304 cases. The data of the Registro Oncológico Nacional de referem 4 424 new case of cancer of the trachea and bronchi in 2018. The data on lung cancer are fractionated based mainly on studies from the Norte do País. An active viral mutation of sarcoma Kirsten rat (KRAS) is found in 25 to 30% of non-small cell CPNs, but represents the prevalence in no CPN. The CPNAS KRAS is a molecularly heterogeneous and heterogeneously diverse group of mutated CPNS. Among all KRAS mutations, a mono-nucleotide KRAS p.G12C variation, with glycine substituted by cysteine without codon 12, is the most frequent variant, with a prevalence of approximately 7 to 12% without CPNPC and 13% in adenocarcinomas.",

      "text": "LUMYCRAS (sotorasib) is a covalent and irreversible cysteine inhibitor of KRAS G12C. An inactivation of the KRASG12C by sotorasib blocks a signalisation, inhibits growth and promotes a selective apoptosis in tumors carrying KRASg12C, with minimal detectable activity outside this target. The treatment is, to date, the only KRAS g12C inhibitor approved by the European Medicines Agency, with a dosage: 960 mg/day PO, until disease progression or toxicity cannot be measured. As the biology of lung cancer has been known, new drugs have been developed that are effective in specific components of cancer. These mutations initiate the oncogenic process and activate signaling pathways that the tumor needs to survive. By blocking this signaling, apoptosis and tumor regression can be induced. This is the framework for the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced CPNPC, such as KRAS G12C mutated, oral therapeutics and with the possibility of sequential use after chemotherapy or immunotherapy. In case of progression, a second line of treatment for advanced CNPPC consists of monotherapy with docetaxel, or with pemetrexed or docetaxil + nitroglycerin combination, or in PD-L1 inhibitors such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab or osbimab followed by tubulin dissemination, followed by Oxytocin, which is an anti-tumor agent that promotes the release of a drug that reduces blood pressure. O nintedanib is a triple angiocinase inhibitor that blocks the activity of the kinase kinase in the receptors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR 1-3), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR α e ß) and fibroblast cell growth factor 12 (FGFR 1-3). It is a combination therapy made with docetaxel. Posology: Nanib 200 mg PO 12/12 h 20/21 [can not be taken daily]; Docetaxel 1 mg: 75 mg IV/21; Adenosine kinase inhibitors are one of the main enzymes responsible for the progression of various metabolic disorders. Nivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody to immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) (HuMAb), which binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptors and blocks interactions with PD-L1 and PD- L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of immune responses of T cells. However, only recently, it has been possible to robustly assess the prevalence of the p.G12C mutation in patients with CPNPC. To do this, it is necessary to use data from the AACR GENIE registry, an international registry containing information from 19 of the main cancer treatment centers in the world. In this registry (Lumykras (Sotorasib)), there were a total of 13,243 patients with cPNPC, of which 29,0% (n = 3838) had a KRAS mutation and 12,16% (n= 12,048) had specifically a PPNPC mutation. It is possible to conclude that, of the 4,603 cases of CPNPC diagnosed annually, 557 (12,1%) will be KRAS p.G12C positive. Using the national data of the Instituto Português de Oncologia do Porto Francisco Gentil, referring to the period between 2012 and 2016, 82,7% of patients with stadium-relevant information were diagnosed in advanced stages (III/IV) of CNPPC. Applying this additional filter to the previous estimate, it is concluded that, yearly, approximately 462 patients will be diagnosed with CPNPN KRAS P.G 12C positive in advanced stage in Portugal.",

All studies were considered relevant for the present evaluation, namely the CodeBrea K 100 and 200 studies with data on safety and efficacy, the study on indirect comparisons, and the codeBreak 200 trial for efficacy analysis. no treatment of patients with advanced CPNPC with KRAS p.G12C positive previously treated with at least one systemic therapy. The inclusion criteria were adult patients (age equal to or greater than 18 years) with diagnosis of CPNCC KRAS P.G 12C positive, in advanced or metastatic stage (III-IV); ECOG PS of 0 or 1; disease progression after prior treatment with anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 agents, in monotherapy or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, or platinum based chemotherapies. The main response criteria were: number of prior treatment lines greater than three, presence of active brain metastases. Patients were allocated to a single treatment regimen, a combined daily dose of 960 mg. The study included an exploratory analysis of QoL, using questions from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), Quality of life Questionnaire Lung Cancer 13 (ORETC QlQ LC13) and the visual analytical scale (VAS) of Euro 5-Level 5 (Level EQD-5L). For the efficacy indicators related to treatment response, all the indications of adverse drug reactions were evaluated with a lower initial dose and were identified with the lowest initial dose. The SG and safety indicators were evaluated in all patients receiving at least one dose of concomitant treatment. A blinded and independent evaluation committee monitored the study for efficacy. A planned inclusion of 105 patients in phase II of the CodeBreaK 100 study, to obtain a 90% power of detection of an objective response (primary indicator) greater than 23%, with a significance level of 5%. This pre-specified value of 23% was derived from the objective response observed in the ramucirumab treatment arm, in combination with docetaxel, in the REVEL phase III study. The study was monitored for futility to perform continuous form analyses with a predictive probability of failure, starting after 25 weeks of completion of the 7-week trial and occurring after 10 weeks of continuous dosing to be evaluated for a suspicious response. The intervals for the SG and SLP targets were summarised using the Kaplan-Meier estimates and 95% confidence intervals. The diagram describing the flow of patients in the CodeB 100 study is presented in Figure 1. A systematic review of the literature and an indirect comparison study3,4 For two RSLs conducted with the objective of identifying all clinical trials evaluating therapies approved in Europe and the United States (excluding directed therapeutic treatments) in patients with advanced CPN with KRPC GAS12 RSC previously treated with mutated methods. A selection of locally controlled adults (including Phase III or Phase IV patients) who were eligible to receive treatment with less advanced methods were included in Phase II (SCLC) Phase III (NSC-IV) randomised controlled trials. The results of the studies included survival (including overall survival, survival without progression and survival with no events), time to progression, time to next treatment, response rates, disease control rate, duration of treatment, adverse event statements. The studies were identified by searching electronic databases, reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and other supplementary sources. RSL RSL met the public guidelines issued by the Cochrane Collaboration and the Centre for Reviews & Dissemination (PRD, York, UK) and was in conformity with the methodological requirements of the UK National Institute for Health and Excellence (NICE), the Consolidated Methods and Preferred Methods for Health Reporting (CONSCRIS) and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Therefore, only the SELECT-1 study met the requirements for conducting an indirect comparison between docetaxel and sotorasib in a population of patients with positive KRAS. However, none of the studies fulfilled the requirements to conduct an indirect comparaison through non-anchored MAIC, the two comparators contemplated in the initial evaluation proposal (docetaxel + nitendanib; pemetrexedo; nivolumab; pembrolizumab, atezolizumab; dupletos de platina) faced a sotorase (CodeBK 100). The main reasons identified were the absence of additional comparators of interest (76.5%, n=13); the lack of information crucial for the realization of the MAIC in the population of interest (KRAS G12C), or in an enlarged population of mutated KRAS (23.5%, n =4) Thus, the only viable indirect comparison in patients with CPNPC advanced KRAS or mutated Kras G12c, previously treated, was of sotorasib versus docetaxel, based on the results of the studies AtuBreak 100 (sotarasib) and SELECT-1 (docetaxel). However, no SELECT-1 study was limited to only one prior treatment, in contrast to the CodeBreaK 100 study, which allowed up to three lines of prior treatment. In addition, patients in the SELECT-1 study did not receive prior treatment with immunotherapy, contrary to what was seen in the majority of patients from the Code BreaK-100 study. These two factors may have been associated with one way of comparison, being reasonably assumed to be more likely to favour docetaxel. However, of a total of 21 potential covariates, only four were selected, according to their availability in studies and the level of prognostic significance in patients treated with sotorasib or docetaxel. These variables were ECOG OS in initial evaluation (0.1); presence of metastases in initial assessment (sim, non); age; and taboo habits. Other covariate models considered were two of sensitivity analysis (Model 1: expression of protein PD-L1%, sex (female), histology in initial review (non-male), racial/ethnic origin (male/female); number of samples in the study and level of predictive significance for patients receiving treatment with Sothorazeb or Docetaxel; size of the original sample: 108, 126, 129, 126); reduction of the mean size of a sample to 14% (average) as a result of the previous analysis. The resulting effective sample size (ESS) was 108.9, representing a mean reduction of 14% compared to the original sample size of 126 patients. In relation to overall survival, an estimated reduction in risk of death of 39% (HR= 0. 611; 95% CI: 0. 451; 0. 829) was estimated, which translates into an extension of the median survival time of 7. 2 months (15. 3 versus 8.1 months) (Figure 3). no risk of progression or death and an extension of 3.5 months no median time to event (6.3 versus 2.8 months) (Figure 4) Figure 4. Kaplan-Meier curves (adjusted) of the treatment with docetaxel no indicator PFS evaluated by investigator As sensitivity analyses present values of HR slightly more advantageous for the treatment but a reduction in ESS was superior (58% no 1 model 65% and no 2 model), affecting an accuracy of the estimates obtained. On the other hand, 30% of patients suffered an adverse reaction that led to their hospitalization. Relative to rates of discontinuation of therapy due to toxicity, no CodeBreaK 100 study, as well as therapeutic withdrawals due to emergent adverse reactions occurred in 11 (8.7%) patients, however, only in 9 (7.1%) patients these withdraws were associated with treatment-related adverse events. No SELECT-1 study, occurred a total of 37 withdrawal events in the docetaxel treatment arm, corresponding to 15% of the treated population. The study was planned for study centers around the world, including approximately 330 patients. Continued treatment with sotorasib or docetaxel after disease progression is allowed at the discretion of the investigator, as well as crossover from the docetaxal group to the sub-drug group, as pre-specified conditions. (1 vs 2 vs 2), race (asiática vs não asiática) e história de envolvimento do sistema nervoso central (SNC) (presente ou ausente). As previous therapeutic lines were evaluated using the criteria: a quimiorradiação para doença localmente avançada e irressecável é considerada uma linha de terapêutica por doença avançada se a progresão ocorrer dentro de 6 meses após o final do tratamento. A quimiirradiació seguida de terapia sistémica planeada (including inhibitor de checkpoint) ou vice-versa sem progresão interveniente documentada é considerada 1 linha de terapia se a progrão ocurrir no prazo de 6 months depois o final da tratamento. An adjuvante line therapy is considered uma terapéutica para doenças avançadas se ocorrer nos 6 meses seguintes ao tratamento final. Each systemic treatment for locally advanced and irresolvable disease is considered a line of therapy for advanced disease if a progression occurs within 6 months after the end of treatment. Each new systemic therapy for progressive disease progressiva e irresecável is considered an intravenous method of metastatic metastasis or a new treatment regimen is not considered a maintenance regimen of line therapy. Adjustments of the chemotherapy regimen for intolerability are not considered a new line of therapy. Tumor evaluations were performed during screening every 6 weeks from cycle 1 day 1 up to week 49 and, subsequently, at intervals of 9 weeks until independent central confirmation of progression, initiation of other anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, loss of follow-up or death, whichever occurred first. Examinations of patients should be subjected to independent central confirmation of progress at the time of the first progressive disease. Patients who received treatment for progression or docetaxel crosslinking for suppression continued to receive examinations after confirmation for the first progressing disease. A tumour response and evaluation were confirmed by the BICR; these evaluations of the progression and response of the disease were based on knowledge of the primary attributions of the alei, according to the RIST1 serology, and are consistent with the use of a dose-response analysis. Knowledge of the randomization attributes, according to RECIST v1.1, is being used for a primary analysis of the parameters. Eligible participants were 18 years of age and CPNPC locally advanced and untreatable or metastatic with KRAS p.G12C mutation documented histologically and no other known oncogenic mutation for which an approved target therapy exists. They must have received and progressed or experienced recurrence of the disease during or after receiving at least 1 prior systemic therapy for advanced disease, including a double platinum-based quotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor, as well as a linear or individual course of therapy, unless there was a contraindication for this therapeutic trial. Measurable disease should be analyzed according to the RECIS v1.1 criteria, a Primary Performance Criterion of the European Group on Fossil Metabolism (EGFS) on Performance of PFS (PFS) A230-A230 When no active events were observed on the cerebral plane. A primary analysis of PFS for superiority should occur when approximately 230 PFS events were observed. An interim PFS analysis for superiorité should be conducted when approximately 70 (160 events) of the total PFS event had been observed from both groups, or when an inclusion of patients had been completed and the last randomized individual had had an opportunity to have 6 weeks of follow-up, or which occurred later. The available study report includes results from a date when the first individual was randomized (04 June 2020) to date of cut-off of the data for this primary PFS review (02 August 2022). A primary global survival analysis should occur at least when at least 198 events (approximately 60% of) were considered superiority had been analyzed, but a RSI (Sykras Lumor) was not present at the time of the final PFS evaluation for this randomized participant, or at least 12 weeks after the last participant had been presented with a significantly maturing or maturing PFS. A total of 616 participants were selected for inclusion in this study and, of these, 345 were included and randomised for sotorasib (171 subjects) or docetaxel (174 subjects). Twenty-five patients (7.2%) never received the experimental product (2 [1.2%] no sotorashib group, 23 [13.2%] non-docetaxel group); 320 patients (92.8%) received at least 1 dose of experimental drug (169 [98.8 %] sotorasaib, 151 [86.8%] docetaxil). A total of 290 patients (84. 1%) discontinued treatment with the experimental product (147 (86. 0%) with sotorasib, 143 (82.2%) with docetaxel), being the main reasons in both treatment groups for disease progression (103 [60. 2%) sotorashib, 95 [54. 6%] docetaxels) and adverse effects (29 [17. 0] sotoratib, 25 [14. 4%) docetaxil). A total of 247 patients (71. 6%) discontinued the study for the following reasons: death (104 [60. 8%] sotorasib, 126 [72. 4%] docetaxel), withdrawal of consent (12 [7. 0%] soturasib; 39 [22. 4%) docetaxels) and loss of follow-up (5 [2. 9%] soterasib and 2 [1. 1%] Docetaxel). Overall survival measurements were based on data from 203 OS events, including 109 patients (64% no sotorasib group) and 94 patients (54% no docetaxel group). A median OS of 10.6 months (IC 95%: 8.9; 14.0) was observed for patients treated for 11 months and 95% for those treated for 3 months. A median follow-up time (IC 95) for SG was 17.71 months (16.95; 19.15) in the sotorasib group and 16.33 months (16,07; 17,08) in the docetaxel group. The median follow-up time (95% CI) was 15.24 (14.85; 17.31) months for sotorasib and 6.87 (5.42; 12.52) months for docetaxel.The benefit observed in PFS resulting from the intervention as compared to docetaxil was consistent across all pre-specified subgroups, including history of CNS involvement, presence of hepatic metastases, number of prior therapeutic measures and level of PD-L5 (see Figure 5.1).

An initial evaluation matrix was defined as comparators of docetaxel, Docetaxel + nitendanib (for adenocarcinomas), pemetrexedo (for histology not predominantly squamous), nivolumab, pembrolizumab (for tumors that express PD-L1 with a TPS >=1%), atezolizumab, dupleto de platina. Additionally, data were presented from the interim analysis of an ongoing, randomized, open, actively controlled phase 3 randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of sotorasib versus docetaxel in patients with locally advanced CPNPC and previously treated, irreversible or metastatic mutation KRAS p.12GC confirmed centrally. In terms of comparative efficacy, the indirect comparative data based on the MAIC methodology provided suggest that sotorasib is associated with a 39% reduction in the risk of death (HR=0.611; 95% CI 0.451-0.829) and an increase in the median survival time of 7.2 months; and a 56% decrease in risk of progression or mortality (HR 0.442, IC95% 0.342-0.571), with an increase of 3.5 months in the time to median death. • A rate of objective response was better in the sotorasib group (28.1% [95% CI: 21.5, 35.4] vs 13.2% [95%CI: 8.6, 19.2], respectively; p<0.001) • The overall state of health/ quality of life presented stability in individuals on docetaxel, while a deterioration was verified in the subgroup, with a modification in the mean square doses for 12 weeks at baseline of 6.93 (96.63% CI: 3.65%), 10.19% of the participants in the non-sotoracib group survived without progression comparatively to 10.1% in the no-docetaxel group. • Overall survival was not different between the groups. Considering overall safety data, sotorasib showed an acceptable profile. No phase III clinical trial showed an incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events, and serious adverse event fatalities were higher in any group treated with sotorashib.",

The evaluation criteria defined by INFARMED included an evaluation of the additional benefits of sotorasib compared to alternatives comparing docetaxel, docetaxil and nitendanib, pemetrexed; nivolumab, pembrolizumab; atezolizuma b and platinum duplet. TAIM submitted a single-arm, phase I/ II, systematic review of the literature, an open-label comparison study by MAIC, and interim data from a randomised phase III clinical trial that allowed a comparison of the treatment with methotrexate and somatically mutated CPNPC in adults with any other advanced treatment. In terms of comparative efficacy, data from the interim analysis of the phase III clinical trial indicate that treatment with sotorasib resulted in an improvement in progression-free survival of 1.1 months and a 34% reduction in the probability of progression or death compared to docetaxel (HR 0.66 [95% CI: 0.51, 0.86], p-value=0.002), with an improvements in evaluation of progress at 12 months (24.8% vs 10.1%) and objective response rates (28.1% [95% IC: 21.5, 35.4] vs 13.2% [95%CI: 8.6, 19.2]). Overall survival was not different between the groups. Considering overall safety data, sotorasib showed an acceptable profile. Conclusions Additional benefit of Lumykras (sotorasib) was evaluated in the indication for treatment of adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (CPNPC) with a KRAS G12C mutation who had progressed after at least one line of previous systemic therapy It was concluded that there was no demonstrated additional benefit of sotorashib compared to standard therapy with docetaxel, however this conclusion was not substantiated in this indication. This conclusion was based on the following facts: • The data from the internal analysis of the Phase III clinical trial of CodeBrea 200K showed no difference in survival between the overall treatment groups, having observed a survival difference of at least 12 months compared to an alternative progression of 1.15% (9.00% vs. 0.56%), compared to 0.001% (9.6%) at 12 months; • There are no data to allow comparison of sotorasib with any of the remaining comparator alternatives indicated in the evaluation matrix. • The therapeutically additive relationship or additional benefit of Lumykras (sotorasib) in the indication of treatment of adults with advanced non-small cell lung (NSCLC) response as KRAS G12C mutated and who have dido, after at least one month, a line of prior systemic therapy alternative that has not demonstrated an additional benefit for sotorashib compared to docetaxel therapy, which was not included in this comparator indicator. • There is a difference between the observed safety improvement rate of 35.1% vs. 12.5% in the following adult treatment groups:",

Compared to the comparator docetaxel, the drug sotorasib did not demonstrate an increased therapeutic value, although it was not funded for this indication. The safety profile of the study showed no difference in overall survival among groups of patients treated, with an observed difference in free survival of 1.1 month compared to comparative alternatives (0.66% [91, 0.865%-0.002% CI=0.002), allowing for an improvement of 12.5% (28.8% vs. 10.1%) compared to the remaining indicative doses of any other alternative medicines.",
