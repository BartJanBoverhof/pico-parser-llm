      "text": "In 2019, the incidence of malignancies in Germany is likely to be 2,882 men and 16,999 women of lung cancer. In Austria, there were 2,483 men and 1,567 women in 2018, while in Switzerland, there were a total of 10,024 men and 6,302 women in the five-year period 2014-2018. Thus, lung cancer is still by far the most common cause of cancer death among men and the second most common among women in the three countries. According to the incidence, mortality rates in Germany are also higher than in Switzerland and Austria (see Table 5). Table 9: Age-standardised death rates by gender in international comparison, ICD-10 C33 – C34, 2017 – 2018 (age Europe standard) Age-standardised mortality rate in 2017-2018 Women Men Switzerland 19,0 33.3 Austria 21,2 40,1 Germany 22,1 43,4 Source: Centre for Cancer Register Data in Robert Koch Institute 3 Trend d Trend The incidence of malancies in Germany reached its peak in the late 1980s. Since then, the incidence rate among women continues to increase continuously (Source: Report on Cancer in Germany, 2016). However, the incidence of the incidence among women in Austria is still declining in the two years.\n\nSocioeconomic status Lung cancer risk is not only inversely correlated with socio-economic status [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. The incidence of lung cancer is higher in low-income population groups, low occupational status and low educational level [5]. To a large extent, the higher prevalence of smoking in people with low socio-economic status contributes to their higher lung cancer risk. In addition, however, there is often also an unfavourable constellation of interacting determinants such as diet and exposure to carcinogenics in the environment [9] or at work, the influence of which is difficult to quantify [10]. At regional level in Germany, the incidence of lung cancer is only increased in men in areas with low socio-economic status [4]. In women, with small-scale data, no significant relationship between regional socioeconomic status and lung cancer can be established. One explanation would be that socio-economic differences in smoking behaviour in women are only later, towards the end of the 20th century [4]. Finally, the socioeconomic status with higher survival is also associated with lower mortality rate [6].",

Although there were still significantly more men (30 percent) smoking than women (20 percent) in the German adult population, smoking rates between the sexes, due to an increase in female smokers, were largely aligned. In 2015, about 10 percent of the male and female adolescents aged 12 to 17 years [20]. The average age in which girls and boys smoked their first cigarette was between 13 and 14 years of age in 2015. In a European study [21], there was an increase in the risk of smoking among men for current cigarette smokers, 24 times the risk of lung cancer than for life-long non-smokers. Ex-smokers had a 7.5-fold higher risk. The corresponding risk estimates for women were found to be greater than for female smokers and 2 significantly for female smokers.\n\nIn the case of long-term exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure\n\nThe proportion of the population living in the municipality is higher than the proportion of the population living in the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of the municipality of that municipality.\n\nIn particular, during the so-called ‘wild years' from 1946 to 1955 there was a very high exposure to ionizing alpha rays. Almost all of the BK cases for ionizing radiation (BK 2402) were reported by the population of Wismut AG. The exposure for working persons in waterworks, healing centres and radon baths was significantly lower. The actual exposure data for radon exposure are estimated at the Federal Office for Radiation Protection's radon chart, which is available online.jpg?_blob=poster&v=12. The maximum annual dose of radiation is 6.2 mSv. The additional flight staff is exposed to more than 1 7 risik kofakto oren 46 mSv per year in the case of cosmic radiation.\n\nFor example, in the United States of America, the number of cancers reported in the United States, Poland, and Germany is increased by up to 1.5 times the relative risk of lung cancer in regions with elevated concentrations of air pollutants [40]. In the meantime it is clear that this increase is mainly due to particulate air pollution In the air suspended particles are very heterogeneous, both in terms of their formation and their chemical composition and size. PM2.5 is almost twice as high at road-related measurement stations as in the urban-rural background. In particular diesel vehicles cause high emissions from fine and ultrafine (<0.1 μm) carbon particles. At their large surface organic substances are adsorbed as e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The current knowledge on the relationship between mortality in adults and long-term exposure is based on the number of females and the number of females.\n\nThis is estimated to be the majority of the population of the population of the population.

The anti-cancer effect of the anti-cancer activity was attributed to the water-soluble nickel compounds. The MAK commission classified metal nickel and nickel in water-insoluble compounds in the form of breathable dusts as carcinogenic in humans in 1972. Since 2001 the water-soluble compounds in the form of aerosols have also been associated with this activity. The dichlorodimethylether, monochlorodimethylether, are used as intermediate products for the synthesis of organic substances in the chemical industry and in the preparation of ion-exchange resins in the meantime. The incidence of lung carcinoma in men who have been exposed to dichlorodiphenyl ether or monochlorodiphenyl ether has been increased by up to 8 % in the factor [61].\n\nIn the case of the epidemiological clarification of a possible dose-effect relationship, it is essential to know which exposures usually occur during hard metal processing.

Consensus Epidemiological studies (Hiroshima and Nagasaki, occupational and medical exposures) have clearly demonstrated in the dose range above 100 mSv. This additional cancer risk, as well as the genetic risk generated by ionising radiation, is called stochastic radiation. According to the current state of knowledge [91], the lung is considered to be one of the relatively highly radiation sensitive organs. A detailed description of the correlations can be found in the chapter \"Epidemiology\". Based on the linear-non-threshold hypothesis, the epidemiological study is considered as the top radiation principle.\n\nIn the case of radiographs, for example, if a doctor steps away from the patient to be examined (from about 30 cm to 1 m), the dose is already reduced by the factor 10. • Screening should be used. For example, in the case of X-ray radiation, a lead apron may reduce the dose depending on the radiation quality between a factor 10 and 100. Thus, in the case of children and adolescents, children in the mother's womb are only exposed to the emergency situation of the mother's radiation. The radiation risk is not strongly dependent on the age of exposure. For this reason, special protective measures are allowed for the unborn child.\n\nIn May 2005, following the evaluation of all available health studies on radon, it was found that from the range of 100 to 200 Bq/m3 there was a statistically significant increase in the rate of lung cancer caused by radon.",

In the case of occupational activities in the environment of natural sources of radiation (cosmic, terrestrial radiation, natural radioactive substances) the radiation doses above 1 mSv are to be determined by the radiation exposure, the radiation exposure is to be enriched.\n\nIn a major European study, however, a summary analysis of 7 cohorts of vitamin 2 was found to have a significant protective effect on either [102] or [103] of the intake of fruits and less of the consumption of vegetables.

Isothiocyanates are metabolites of glucosinolates that occur in high concentrations in cross-flower plants. Similar to this type of vegetables, the risk of lung cancer was lower in increased intake or urine levels of isothiocyanates [118], [119], [120]. Similarly, there is sufficient evidence that flavonoids, in particular quercetin, may lead to a similar weis of a reduction in lung cancer rate [121], [122], [123] (evidenceg 3a) is also responsible for the presence of a high level of sulphon cancer in respect to which there is a high incidence.",

Both the large Dutch-Belgian NELSON study as well as the significantly smaller German LUSI study and the 10-year post-evaluation of the Italian MILD study were able to confirm the positive results of the NLST and also a significant reduction of the baseline carcinoma-related mortality.\n\nThe analysis of the initial screening round of 5 British pilot centres showed a prevalence of lung cancer of 2.2% (250/11.148 screened individuals) and compared with 8 randomized-controlled studies of more favourable rates regarding false-positive findings (2.0%; 291/11.148) and resection of benign findings (0.07%; 8/11.148) to [155]. In view of the intended establishment of a national lung cancer screening program in Germany, a reassessment of the data situation was required. As the first decisive step in October 2020, the evidence assessment carried out on behalf of the G-BA was submitted by the Institute for Quality and Economicality in Health Care (IQWIG). In its final report, the IQWIG identified a benefit of the low-dose-CT screening against no screening and thus that for (former) strong female and female smokers the benefit of low-dose-CT lung cancer screening was assessed [149].

It is intended to be used in symptomatic patients, in curative therapy indications of higher grade NSCLC and SCLC as well as in SCLC prior to prophylactic brain radiation, since it is superior to the CT. Because the MRI tends to be more meaningful for the differential diagnosis of liver lesions and adrenal glands than the CT, it is particularly suitable for the far-reaching clarification of focal lesions found in routine diagnosis of these organs. Also, it is considerably superior to the CT in musculoskeletal imaging, so that clinically conspicuous findings in bones and soft parts should also be examined b negative CT findings for reliable metastasis exclusion by MRI.

To this end, the status of the educational process should be documented in a comprehensible manner. Consensus-based recommendation examined 2024 Prior to the communication of the information, the patient should be asked with what knowledge, with which ideas, hopes and fears in connection with his illness the patient goes into the discussion. Consensus-based recommendation examined 2024 members should be perceived and appreciated in their role as supporters and co-affected persons. They should be asked about their needs and, if necessary, encouraged to accept support offers. Consensus background As soon as the diagnosis of a lung carcinoma is secured, the patient should be informed by the treating physician. In this context, the patient should be given the discretion of the patient, whether the partner, family member or third party should be involved. Sponsors of the discussion are actively listening and the expression of empathy, and the patient should nevertheless inform the patient's opinion on how to express his or her feelings.\n\nIt is necessary to inform the patient of the outcome of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event, to inform the patient of the event and to the patient of the event.\n\nIn addition to providing an opinion on the subject, the discussion on the subject of the patient's treatment should also be conducted in conjunction with an opinion on the treatment of the patient.

Consensus-based recommendation is examined 2024 The expression of a patient's death/death wish with an unhealable cancer should be met with empathy and willingness to talk about it. Consensus background \"Talk about dying and death are among the major challenges in the treatment of patients with an unhealable cancer. Investigations have shortcomings in the communication on the topics \"Prognosis, End of Life and Death are shown [509], [510], [512], [513], [514]. Most patients want to talk about the meaning of this conversation content early and repeatedly in the course of the disease [5] [5] want to offer an open conversation about dying in all dimensions.\n\nThe following are some of the following: • e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e@ e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e-mail: e@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@www.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end.end\n\nIn view of the importance of 2 conz ept d of the early integration of palliative care, patients were treated with a pre-explanatory schedule of treatment (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment) (pre-explanatory schedule of treatment).\n\nAs a side effect, it was noted that the early inclusion of palliative structures reduced costs For the recommendation of an early integration of palliative care, the study situation for metastatic lung cancer is exemplary, since at the time of diagnosis 40% of all patients with lung carcinoma have remote metastases. The symptom load is high and often diagnostic. The median survival time of the overall group is also only –1222--- 18 months for palliative chemo and radiation therapy. Compared to a 5-year period (2007 to 2009) the overall survival rates for NCLC have slightly increased (men: +0.8%, women: +0.6%) [540] [541]. Thus, maintaining or improving the quality of life constitutes an essential therapy/intervention goal. The recognition of the benefit of an early integrative concept between oncological standard therapy and palliative treatment has already led to 8.2 concept of early integration of palliative care in the USA.",

Here, following the introduction of the defined trigger criteria, positive indications for a successful previous integration of palliative co-sufficiency [551] were identified. As a primary trigger for the integration of specialised palliative care patients, the following criteria were identified by Ferrell et al.

In addition, there was a decrease in the incidence of Relapse 15% vs. 19% [616].

(Evidence Level 2a) All the above-mentioned studies showed a decrease in the incidence of pain [611], a decrease in the incidence of Relapse 15% vs. 19% [612], and a decrease in the incidence time of complications in the VATS.\n\nIn the case of patients who had been diagnosed with the disease, the incidence rate was estimated at 8.4%, the incidence rate was estimated at 8.4%, the incidence rate was estimated at 8.4%, the incidence rate was estimated at 8.4%, the incidence rate was estimated at 8.4%, the incidence rate was estimated at 8.4%, the incidence rate was estimated at 8.4%, the incidence rate was estimated at 8.4%, the incidence rate was estimated at 8.4%, the incidence rate was estimated at 8.4%, the incidence rate was estimated at 8.4%, the incidence rate was estimated at 8.4%, the incidence rate was estimated at 8.4%, the incidence rate was estimated at 8.4%, the incidence rate was estimated at 8.\n\nIf there is no significant difference between the two studies, then there is no significant difference between the two studies.

However, a later study showed no difference in survival between patients with an en-bloc full wall resection or a less aggressive procedure if a complete resection is achieved [629] (Evidence Grade 3b). In terms of the intensity of the surgical procedure, all studies showed no significant difference in mortality (Evidence Grade 3b). The radicality of breast wall resection is a significant predictive factor (Evidence Grade 3b). The depth of breast resection could also affect the overall response.",

On the one hand, the integration of immunotherapy into a trimodal concept with radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery is investigated in studies [706], and on the other hand, the question of the extent to which non-radiotherapy neoadjvuante chemoimmun therapy could be used in the checkmate-816 study, possibly also in the case of pancoast tumors, could be discussed. For important prospective studies on trimodal therapy in the case of pancoast tumors, rates of complete pathological response of 28% and 29% respectively were reported [697], [705], in a recent systematic review of all studies on neoadjuvant immunotherapy, NSCLC (except pancoast tumors) was also followed by the pool of the last stages of I5.3.",

In patients, a radical mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed. He distinguished the microscopic infestation of a single lymph node level (mN2L1), the microscopic infestation of several lymph node stations (mN2L2+), the preoperatively detected in a single lymph node station (cN2L1) and the preoperatively known infestation of several lymph node stations (cN2L2+).

Strong Consensus In the locally advanced stage of the NSCLC, various definitive multimodal therapy regimes are available. Which is used is essentially determined by the exact tumor expansion. In addition to the exclusion of extrathoracic remote metastasis, the extension of the tumor disease in the mediastinal is of crucial importance for the prognosis and the further interdisciplinary therapeutic approach [710], [709], [708], [711], [712]. A preoperative PET-CT examination is for a mediastinal lymph node infestation of sensitive and specific as a computer tomogram and is significantly correlated with the histopathological finding.

Randomized phase III studies both in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant approach are active. A study with atezolizumab after adjuvant chemotherapy showed an advantage in disease-free survival in resecrated stage II – IIIA compared to best supportive care. This effect was more pronounced in the case of existing PD-L1 expression [671]. Based on these data, in the inoperable stage III when PD-L1 was detected, chemoradiotherapy was followed by durvalumab of current standard. In the operable stage, the inhibition of PD-1 or PD-L1 is likely to be established in the inoperable stage III.

In the second-line therapy, pembrolizumab monotherapy compared with docetaxel leads to a significant increase in survival time (HR 0.71; median 1.9 months), an increase in response rate and a reduction in severe side effects. The progression-free survival was not significantly prolonged. Pembrolizumab is only approved in the second-line therapy in patients with immunohistochemical evidence of PD-L1 expression in at least 1% of the tumour cells. Adverse reactions in the CTCAE Grade 3/4 with pembrolizumab are also the most common of all adverse reactions (both 14%) among pembrolizumab, followed by nausea and diarrhoea.\n\nIn the Revel study, the anti-VEGFR 2 antibody ramucirumab was associated with a dose of 10 mg/kg b.w. in patients who had been treated with placebo/docetaxel. In both patients who had had been treated with placebo/docetaxel, there was a significant improvement in survival time (median survival time 1.4 months, HR 0.86) as well as in the PFS (median PFS 1.5 months, HR 0.76). In another study, squamous cell carcinoma therapy was significantly increased from 8.2 months (docetaxel and ramucirumab) to 9.5 months (docetaxel and ramucirumab) in squamous cell carcinoma [1007]. In one study, 795 patients were treated with squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nThe other substances and combination substances authorised in second-line therapy (docetaxel, ramucirumab, docetaxel, afatinib) are also available and may be used in second- and third-line immunotherapy. Although there are no formal study data available, this recommendation is pronounced in the Keynote10 study [109], 36% in the Checkmate 17 study [810] due to different toxicity profiles of immunotherapy and chemotherapy as well as the fact that patients received subsequent chemotherapy in the immune checkpoint inhibitor studies. 8.6 Stadi EK Empfeh A Level of",

Thus, the immune checkpoints mediated signal pathways lead to a reduction in T-cell proliferation, cytokin emissions and secretion of cytotoxic granules [1017] . In recent years, antibodies, called immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICI) were developed to restore T-cell function. In NSCLC, ICI was tested against PD-1 and PD-L1 and CTLA-4. In Phase III studies, the use of ICI or ICI+ICI in combination with chemotherapy and chemotherapy+antiangiogenices was also evaluated.",

patients with HIVD2 than in patients with chemotherapy (HR 0.66, P = 0.029). Recently, a 5-year survival rate of 31.9% was reported for the pembrolizumab group [1035]. In another phase III study (KEYNOTE-042, NCT02220894) [968], pembrolizumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy was not allowed as first-line therapy in NSCLC patients with advanced/ metastatic tumour. In a 1:1 schedule, 637 patients were randomised to the two arms. The primary endpoint was overall survival in patients with PD-L1 status ≥50 %, ≥20 % and ≥1%.\n\nIn one phase III study (ImPower 110; NCT02409342) this was similar to that of TDI in the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the third half of the second half of the third half of the second half of the third half of the third half of the second half of the third half of the third half of the second half of the third half of the third half of the second half of the third half of the third half of the third half of the third half of the third half of the third half of the third half of the third half of the third half of the third half of the third half of the third half of the third half of the third half of the third half of the third half of the fourth half of the fourth half of the fourth half of the fourth half of the fourth half of the fourth half of the fourth half of the second half of the fourth half of the fourth half of the fourth half of the fourth half of the second half of the fourth half of the second half of the fourth half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the fourth half of the second half of the fourth. the fourth.\n\nThe primary endpoint of this study was negative with a PFS of 4.2 months in the Nivolumab arm versus 5.9 months in the chemotherapy arm (HR 1.15, P = 0.25). Also the overall survival was statistically not significant with a median OS of 14.4 months in the Nivolumab arm versus 5.9 months in the chemotherapy arm (HR 1.02). Also for the subgroup of PD-L1 highly positive tumours (≥50% PD-L1 Expression) there was no significance for the PFS (HR 1.07) or for the OS (HR 0.90). In a phase III study (EMPOWER Lung 1; NCT03088540) [Sazer et al., Lancet 2021], a crossover of chemotherapy to Cempilab was also allowed in the progres endpoint.\n\nIn addition, the incidence rate of adverse events in ICI (except immuno-related adverse reactions) was significantly lower than in chemotherapy. In addition, pembrolizumab is an important treatment option for patients with non-plate epithelial NSCLC and PD-L1 overexpression (≥50 %). Atezolizumab can also be used as a monotherapy in this group.\n\nIn the case of patients who have been diagnosed with the disease after one year of therapy, however, the results show that stopping therapy after one year increases the risk of a progression. However, the high risk of a therapy stop is the ineffectiveness of the ICI in a re-induction. However, it is shown in studies that a re-induction in progression leads to a renewed clinical response in 70 % of patients. However, one clinical benefit seems to be limited to patients who have been treated with the disease after one year of therapy.\n\nHowever, in all studies on palliative first-line therapy of NSCLC with ICI or chemo-immune therapy, the incidence of autoimmune diseases and viral infections has been reported to be higher than 10 % of patients with autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatic arthritis or chronic inflammatory bowel disease) 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 277. Patients with hepatitis or HIV could not be included either. However, there are more recent findings on patients with these risk factors, which are presented below to assess a treatment decision in individual cases. Autoimmune diseases The prevalence of autoimmune diseases in NSCLC is 14% and most of the diseases concern rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and polymyalgia [1036]. Real World data show that up to 22% of patients with NSCLC who received ICI have a history of autoimmune diseases [1037], but that autoimmune diseases are not associated with increased mortality [1039].\n\nThe effectiveness of the ICI therapy in patients with autoimmune disease was similar to that of patients without these diseases; the response rate was higher in patients with HCV with HCV. The incidence of HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HV with HCV with HCV with HCV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HCV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HCV with H with H with HV with H with HV with HV with H with HV with H with H with H with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with H with H with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with H with H with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with H with H with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with HV with H with H with\n\nIn addition, the overall survival of patients with HIV and lung carcinoma was not limited by HIV status. They had been generally well tolerated and in 93% of patients continued to suppress the HIV virus under therapy [1051]. In addition, two prospective studies showed a well tolerable safety profile without viral reactivation as well as good activity in advanced tumours, including the NSCLC [1052], [1053]. ICI therapy can hypothetically even increase HIV specific immunity, as the immune system strengthened by immunotherapy can destroy HIV reservoirs that remain in the body despite retroviral therapy [983]. It is recommended to be a CD 4 and CD8 during ICI.\n\nIn addition, two minor Phase III studies showed a significant survival benefit in favour of cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy [684] for the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the second of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the first half of the second of the first half of the second of\n\nThere was no indication of the difference between the 6 month survival rate and the 6 month survival rate. A difference between the 6 month survival rate of > 33% and the 6 month survival rate (MÜZ 7 months; p = 0,2) was observed in comparison between 4 and 6 months in comparison with 3 versus 6 months in comparison with 4 months in comparison with 3 versus 6 cycles mitomycin/Vinblastin.\n\nHowever, in the case of patients who had had been treated with the disease, there was no evidence of survival of the disease, but there was no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of survival of the disease, no evidence of disease, no evidence of disease, no evidence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of disease, but of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of absence of\n\nThere was no increase in survival in the first study (JM) or in 4 cycles.\n\nHowever, there was no improvement in the overall incidence of overdose in patients with GEMTIBIN.\n\nHowever, in all patients, a combination of 1 patient was not considered to be of benefit to 2 patients [1059]. In the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study IUNO, the benefit-risk ratio of maintenance therapy with erlotinib was not evaluated positively (HR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.22; p = 0.8183). The authorisation of first-line maintenance therapy was therefore limited to patients with unchanged 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 282 disease status after initial line chemotherapy, whose tumours continue to exhibit an activating EGFR mutation. Factors that thus were considered to be a success of maintenance therapy were two-line chemotherapy, performance status, histology and molecular marker.\n\nIn the case of cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisptan, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, ci, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisplatin, cisp. cisp. cisplatin, cisp\n\nThere is no significant survival benefit for cisplatin (HR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.82-1.20; 10 randomised studies, n=2515).

Another subgroup (meta) analysis of 6 randomised studies showed a significant survival benefit for carboplatin when low cisplatin doses (40-80 mg/m2) were used in the comparator arm (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03-1.28). However, in the published metaanalysis studies, studies with bevacizumab, in which carboplatin was frequently used as a combination partner, and data from the combination of pemetrexed therapy, which are considered as a chemotherapy standard for non-plate epithelial NSCLC, are also recommended for use in combination therapy.",

In a metaanalysis [1136], the pooled sensitivity of ctNA is examined.\n\nAZD 9291 was evaluated in an expanded phase I and II study in 253 patients, 31 patients were treated in a dose escalation section of the study. In the T790M positive group, 61% (78/121 patients in the phase I/II study) and 64% (68/107 in the expansion cohort), respectively, in the T790M negative group, only 21% (13/61 patients). The preliminary PFS in the T790M + group was 9.6 months, the PFS in the T790M negative group, 2.8 months [1117]. The side-effect spectrum was observed in 6% of patients at the therapeutic dose of 1x 80 mg. These data led to an approval by the EMA also without phase III data. In February 2017, the results of an unlabelled study were confirmed.\n\nOne of the most frequent adverse reactions (n=2x lung failure, 1x pneumonitis, 1x ischaemic stroke vs. 1 [hypoleemic shock]) in the osimertinib group was reported to have been reported in the overall survival data (n=2x pneumonitis, 1x ischaemic stroke vs. 1 [hypoleemic shock]).\n\nImmune therapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors has shown less efficacy in several studies than in NSCLC patients without driver mutation and lack of survival advantage compared to chemotherapy alone [1142], [1009], [1143], [1053]. The only exception so far is the impower150 study in which atezolizumab was given in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin [1144].",

The metachronic metastasation is independent of the oncological status of the primary tumor: curatively treated and controlled or still present/tumorprogress. The occurrence of a limited number of metachronic metastases allows, if the primary lung carcinoma appears curatively treated and without local recurrence controlled, the local curative/ablative therapy of the metastases [1225]. Currently, under the influence of effective system therapies in the treatment of lung carcinoma, the induced oligomatastastase disease situation is described.

systemic progression, the prognosis of patients is the better the longer the therapy-free interval. In the case of late recurrence, reinduction therapy is the treatment of the first choice. In all other cases, changing the therapy regime makes sense. • In relapse therapy, the superiority of topotecan compared to BSC is demonstrated. Topotecan is the best established substance with the most extensive data. • In sensitive recurrence and good general condition of the patient, a significant advantage could be achieved with the combination of cisplatin/Irinotecan/Etoposided compared to topotecan. • All other regimens of therapy have so far no superiority over topotecan monotherapy. These include approaches with the chemotherapy substances amrubicin and lurbinectidine, the angiogenesis inhibitors of the receptors of the receptors of the vaccine and have one checkpoint.",

The structured follow-up plan should be suitable to identify relapses, secondary carcinomas, complications and toxicities of therapy and the need for psychooncology and social counselling. The structured course plan/follow-up plan should be appropriate for progression/recimid, secondary carcinomas, and toxicities of therapy and the requirement of psychonology, often to detect the incidence of contraindicative therapy on the basis of the exercise.",

However, they are not quite clearly classified. Thus, in the first three to four years, there were no differences in survival data from the structured imaging follow-up studies. However, after four to five years, a clear, significant difference in the discovery and diagnosis of secondary tumours was shown. These can then be partially treated again. The long-term survival results of this study are still pending, but overall, the DFS lead for the intensive post-mortem group is a semi-mortem assessment of the outcome of the study.\n\nAlso for the screening of brain metastases in post-care and the importance of outcomes, there are currently no clinical data available for the diagnosis of brain metastases, so that screening for brain metastases in clinically inconspicuous patients is not recommended without clear risk indication. However, this point is to be answered in risk situations with LD-SCLC, with ED-SCLC and especially with the question of using PCI or alternatively imaging observation with PCI or stereotaxia of metastases. On the contrary, here MUSS is carried out in a chosen observation strategy as in the Japanese study with ED-SCLC an MRI skull every three months. This must be taken into account in the choice of a watch and wait procedure today. Meanwhile, there are also in the stage IVA and IVB NSCLC risk collectives, in which a high cumulative development of brain metastases has already been demonstrated in this area of survival.",

Therefore, more and more experts are calling for evidence of the effectiveness and safety of new therapies in elderly and fragile patients. These evidence should absolutely require regulatory approval prior to the approval of new therapies. With the focus on geriatric cancer patients, there are also completely new study questions, such as the comparison of different treatment strategies (including dose reduction and possibly exchange or omission of individual substances). For example, in the case of breast cancer, the advantage of \"softer\" chemotherapy compared to conventional chemotherapy has already been demonstrated in one study [1664]. Studies specifically for older cancer patients should become mandatory when standard therapy differs from that for younger patients. Therefore, the experts in the position paper also recommend that minor studies, possibly without a control group, should not be used to determine the efficacy groups.",
