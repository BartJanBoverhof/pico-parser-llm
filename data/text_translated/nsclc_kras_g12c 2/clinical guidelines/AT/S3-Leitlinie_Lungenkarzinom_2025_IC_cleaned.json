Accordingly, a group process or structured consensus conference moderated by the AWMF and DGG was carried out. In the context of these processes, the recommendations were formally agreed by the authorised mandate holders. The results of the respective votes (consensus strength) are allocated to the recommendations according to the categories in the table on consensus strength. In the guideline for all evidence-based statements and recommendations, the evidence level of the underlying studies and, in the case of recommendations, the strength of the recommendation (recommendation level) are additionally indicated. In terms of the strength of the recommendation, three degrees of recommendation are distinguished in this guideline (see table on the degree of recommendation), which are also reflected in the formulation of the recommendations, Table 5: Scheme of recommendation degree of recommendation Description A Strong recommendation for or against a measure - express = should not recommend or oppose a measure - express a majority of opinion.",

      "text": "In addition, the incidence rate of cancer in Germany continues to rise (source: Report on cancer in Germany, 2016). However, in both countries, the incidence rate in women seems to stabilize over the last few years. Despite the decline in incidence rates among men, the incidence rate for Germany is expected to continue to increase in view of the increasing incidence in women and demographic development until 2022. However, in Germany and other countries, the incidence rates in both sexes are likely to increase.\n\nIn the case of women, there is no significant relationship between re- gional socio-economic status and lung cancer. An explanation would be that socio-economic differences in smoking behaviour in women have only developed later, towards the end of the 20th century. [4] Finally, the socioeconomic status is correlated with survival after diagnosis. The individual income is inversely associated with letality [6]. A low regional socio-eco-nomical status is associated with a lower 5-year excess rate among women in Germany as well as with a lower 5-year excess rate [11], [12]. In the international comparison, a opposite relationship is observed: New disease and death rates are associated with letality [6].

Consensus Epidemiological studies (Hiroshima and Nagasaki, occupational and medical exposures) have clearly demonstrated in the dose range above 100 mSv that ionizing radiation increases the risk of cancer linearly, without taking the dose into account.\n\nFor example, in the case of a patient who has undergone an X-ray exposure, the exposure to X-rays and the exposure to X-rays are not subject to limit values. In particular, the exposure to X-rays and the exposure to X-rays are subject to limit values.

The scientific advisory body of the Federal Environment Ministry, the Radiological Protection Commission, has found that from the age of 100 to 200 Bq/m3 there is a statistically significant increase in the rate of lung cancer caused by radon. The idea of prevention requires measures to protect against radon below this threshold of significance. Basically, the radon concentration in residential areas can be reduced by increased ventilation or ventilation. However, in particular in the winter, the heat loss should be assessed with regard to higher radon concentrations.\n\nHowever, in the case of methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone, methadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone...hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone,hadone\n\nHowever, the combination of the data for vitamin C is suggestive of a positive effect, while for vitamin A no statements could be made [111]. These low-molecular substances are formed by plants and either have a potent antioxidative activity (Flavonoid) or induce phase 2 detoxification enzymes such as glutathion-S-transzynate.\n\nThe effect of alcohol consumption on the risk of lung cancer is epidemiologically difficult to delineate from a co-operative cigarette consumption, which may be responsible for this association. 4.6 Medi Empfehl A Level of",

for US adults aged 55–80 years with a cumulative exposure of 30 pack years and an active or previous nico- tinabusus within the last 15 years [194]. This corresponds to the inclusion criteria used in the NLST study, but with an extension of the maximum exposure age from 75 to 80 years. In 2021, after the publication of the outcomes of the NELSON study, the USPSTF updated its recommendation and thus reduced the minimum age for screening from 55 to 50 years as well as the cumulative exposure of 20 to 20 to 20 to 20 years.\n\nFor example, in the case of an individual disease, the incidence of a disease in the population of the population of the population of the population of the

It is important that a patient with lung carcinoma and para- neoplastic syndrome is not excluded on the basis of clinical symptoms alone from a potentially curative treatment [271], [281], [282] (evidence grade 5).\n\n• Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erythropoiethropoietin disease • Erythrophomy disease • Erythropoie disease • Erythropoiexia disease • Erythropoiexia disease • Erythropoietin disease • Erytri disease • Erythrophatrium disease • Erythropoiexia disease • Erythrodon disease",

the use of cMRI for the search for brain metastases is mainly recommended in the published, mostly older studies ([304]; [305]; [307]), while a ret- ter study from 2004 based on the observed low incidence of asymptomatic brain metastases in the study population (3 out of 141 patients, since 0 out of 80 without lymph node metastases) argued against the routine use of cMRI ([308]).

In this case the diagnosis of the disease is only symptomatic for the implementation of palliative measures. A minimal difference between SCLC and NSCLC is that for the metastatic stage a subdivision of the stage IV in IVA and IVB is not necessary [400]. TNM classification The clinical classification of the tumours by their spread locally, regionally and remotely allows a pragmatic handling of the diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. The comparison of results of clinical studies and the evaluation of registers is only possible by classification of tumors. Thus, the classification of the tumours according to their degree of spread is not to be examined by COPD.\n\nThe following are the following: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemire: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vemitrile: Vimitrile: Vimitrile: Vimitrile: Vimitrile: Vimitrile: Vimitrile: Vemire: Vimitrile: Vimitrile: Vimitrile: Vimire: Vemire: Vemire: Vimitrile: Vimitrile: Vimitrile: Vemire: Vemire: Vemire: Vemire: Vemire: Vemire: Vxie: Vinitrile: Vxie: Vxie: Vimire: Vimire: Vxile: Vxie: Vini: Vini: Vini: Vini: Vini: Vini: Vini: Vinitrile: ViniI: Vemie: Vxile: Vemi: Vini: Vini: Vinitrile: Vinitrile: Vinitrile: Vini: Vini: Vemi: Vemi: Vini: Vini: Vini: Vini: Vinitrile: Vxie: Vinitrile: Vini: Vini: Vinitri: Vini: Vini: Vini: Vinitrile: Vin:\n\n• For each localization, 2 classifications may be described: • Clinical classification: the pretherapeutic clinical classification, described as TNM (or cTNM), is important for the selection and evaluation of the therapy. • They are based on pre-treatment findings. Such findings are based on clinical examination, imaging procedures, endoscopy, biopsy, surgical exploration and other relevant examinations. • Pathological classification: the postoperative histopathological classification, called pTNM, is used for the indication for adjuvant therapy and provides additional data to estimate the prognosis and calculate final results. In this classification, the pre-treatment findings are supplemented or modified by findings obtained during the surgical procedure and by the pathological assessment of the parasite lymph nodes (the pathological assessment of the primary tumor (pT) requires a resection of the primary tumor or biopsies that are adequate for the determination of the highest pT category.\n\nIf you want to know more about metastasis, then you need to know more about metastasis.

Treatment of lung carcinoma with infiltration of the upper thoracic aperture consists of a combined radio-chemotherapy and possibly secondary resection, regardless of the depth of infiltration (at least pleura parietalis), which is difficult to determine in individual cases. Therefore, the term pancoast tumor can be used for the detection of infiltration of the pleura parietalis above the second rib. The extent of the disease varies in these tumours and should be classified according to the known rules. An invasion of the vertebral body or the spinal canal or a walling of the subclavia vessel or an advanced involvement of upper branches of the plexus brachialis (C8 or above) is not classified as T4. If none of these criteria is present, the tumor is classified as T3 as a small number of Tku.",

These risks are mainly dependent on the cardiopulmonary function preoperatively and on the extent of the planned lung resection. If this is a heterogeneous pulmonary emphysema and the tumor to be removed is located in an emphysematically converted lung lobe, which can be removed as part of a lung volume reduction, postoperative functional impairment is less likely than computational [468]. The decision on this surgical combination intervention should be taken in an interdisciplinary conference.",

The fact that they are not left alone with this topic will, therefore, show that: • in the event that patients themselves suspect that death and death have a real meaning for them, it is true that they have a feeling of comfort and security when they are told that they are not satisfied with the topic [587], [588]. • [514] 8.1 Bede Selection EK eutung nskrite g of age, comorbidity, prognostic assessment, and burden of symptom burden than 198 erium for therapy measures The non-small cell lung carcinomathe importance of age, comorbidity, prognostic assessment and symptom burden as a criterion for therapy measures be examined in the event of a higher life age should not be used to be used as as as a result of a higher life to be be used for treatment with a dose be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be the therapy Tra\n\nIn the case of patients who have been treated with contraceptive therapy, the prediscipline of the patient is adjusted to the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline of the prediscipline.\n\nSeveral positive studies were able to provide a signifi-cant effect of the early integration of palliative care to patients with metastatic pulmonary carcinoma.

In 2010 the OBD published the retrospective data of 87 patients (stage IA: n = 64; stage IB: n = 23), who were medically qualified for lobectomy, but decided to use SBRT [708]. Cumulative local control was carried out 5 years after SBRT (median BED10: 116 Gy) and 92% for T1-tumors and 73 for T2-tu- moren.\n\nIn this group, the majority of patients with adeno-ca (79 %) and peripheral localization (67 %) were treated with an SBRT. These results were compared with a surgically treated patient group of the MD Anderson Cancer Center using propensity score matching. In this group, where a VATS lobectomy was performed with a mediastinal lymph node dissection, a 3-year survival of 91% and a 5-year survival of 84% were reported. In the multivariable analysis, no survival differences were observed between the SBRT and the surgically treated cohorts. Despite the limited number of cases, the Reivised STARS trial does not have to be discussed with any other patients who are able to achieve SBRT due to a patient who is willing to perform an operation or who is able to follow a baseline overview.\n\nThere were no significant differences in the number of lymph nodes (e.g., the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of lymph nodes in the number of patients.\n\nIn addition to these studies, the proportion of patients who had been treated with T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T\n\nSeveral small case studies have shown that a more ag- gressive procedure, in the sense of an en-bloc resection, was associated with a better overleaf treatment than less aggressive methods (evidence level 3b) [691], [692]. However, a later study showed no differences in survival between patients with an en-bloc full-wall breast wall resection or a less aggressive progression if a complete resection is achieved [693] (evidence level 3b). Regarding the aggressiveness of the surgical procedure, all studies show no significant difference in lethality (evidence level 3b). The radicality of breast wall resection is a significant predictive factor (evi-denz grade 3). The depth of breast wall infiltration may affect the prognosis, where a greater role is played here in surgical technique, which is also recommended only in case of pleurainvasion without rib infiltration.",

This also follows from a subgroup analysis of the IALT study [748]. An analysis of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study E3590 and the Italian study of Trodella et al. showed that postoperative radiotherapy with modern technology and narrowly limited target volumes does not lead to an increased risk of late, non-tumour-related deaths. According to data from retrospective and prospective randomized studies on the locoregional effectiveness of postoperative radiotherapy, this will not lead to postoperative radiotherapy at stage IIIA, an individually classified local recurrence risk, or after R1/R2 resection in individual cases – using radiation therapeutic methods with as low a load as possible – nor to postoperative radiotherapy nor postoperative Iditivity survival after stage II.",

Since adjuvant chemotherapy has become the standard in R0-resected non-small cell lung cancer since 2008 and the certified German lung cancer centres have been evaluating this since circa 2009 on the basis of data, there is now a sufficient competence in the larger centres to assess this sensitive decision [888], [853], [873], [874].

However, an effectiveness of induction chemotherapy was found in randomised studies prior to surgery in patients with NSCLC in stage III. Here, 2-3 cycles were applied [724]. Overall, a low-dose daily cardioplatinism or cisplatin therapy should be considered in the individual therapy selection. In this case, older patients have more adverse reactions up to deaths under simultaneous radiochemotherapy [827].\n\nOverall, an irradiation planning based on a PET/CT is complemented by a minimally invasive mediastinal spread diagnosis based on the results of comparative studies more precise than the irradiation planning using elective lymph node radiation after a lung lobe-specific spread probability. The loco-regional tumor control was not subordinated to a protocol analysis in the PET Plan-Stu- based radiation planning of a larger volume radiation therapy involving elective lymph nodes and CT positive lymph nodes [974]. In this study, the entire infested lymph node station with a PET positive lymph node was included in the clinical target volume.

The benefit was independent of the degree of PD-L1 expression. Median progression-free survival was 6.4 vs. 4.8 months {HR 0.56; p< 0.001}. Unwanted Grade 3 and higher adverse events occurred in 69.8 % in patients treated with epithyroidism and 68.2 % in the comparator arm. Adverse effect-free survival was 0.8 and overall survival was 0.74 in favour of pembrolizumab [1031]. In an analysis of the subgroup with a PD-L1 status, an increase in treatment with epithyroidism was also considered in the 4th and 4th cycles.\n\nHowever, in the longer term, patients with less than 1% PD-L1-expressing tumour cells benefited from double check-point inhibition compared to chemotherapy. In particular, the immuno-associated toxicity was seen in the quadruple combination followed by maintenance therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab. Another combination of two checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy was evaluated in the POSEIDON study [1037] and led to an increase in the incidence of endo-criminological (premium thyroid) and onset of adverse reactions.\n\nIn addition, in the case of a combination of patients, a combination of patients with methamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metamotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy with metotherapy\n\nThere was no significant increase in the incidence of overdose in patients who had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had not had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had\n\nIn comparison to best-supportive-care, the two-generation cytostatics in combination with mono-chemotherapy have been compared with the two-stage combination of the two-stage combination of the two-stage combination and the two-stage combination of the two-stage combination. [630], [636], [649], [643], [639], [639], [649], [643], and three prospectively randomised studies show a significant survival advantage of third-generation combinations of the two-stage combination (cisplatin/ vinorelbin versus cisplatin/vindesin [759], [64], [64], [64], [64], [64], [64], [64], [64], [64], [64].\n\nHowever, in a further study, a 1-year survival rate of 15% was not established (MÜZ 6 versus 7 months; p= 0.2); however, in the comparative arm only 31% of patients received 6 cycles of chemotherapy [716].\n\n36.5 % of patients had been shown to be clinically significant (p=0.16). As regards the adverse reactions, the metaanalysis showed a higher rate of severe anaemia (> Grade 3) in patients with therapie regimens with 6 cycles of 7.8% vs. 2.9%). The concept of maintenance therapy was tested in several randomised studies in patients with good general condition (PS 0 and I). In order to explain the effect of first-line therapy, either a continuation of therapy with a substance of first-line therapy (continuation maintenance) or a change of the substance after 4 cycles of a platinum-containing first-line therapy (switch mainte- nance) was investigated.

In some studies, ECOG-2 patients and older patients (over 65 or over 70 years) are considered together, where there are overlaps, but also differences between these patient groups.

In the case of ADI, the incidence of ADI is higher than in the case of ADI, the incidence of ADI is higher than in the case of ADI in the case of ADI.\n\nFor one of the patients with a mean PD-L1 Expression, however, the incidence of the disease was not increased in the duration of the disease. However, for one of the patients with a dose-related disease, the incidence of the disease was not increased in the duration of the disease. The most recent approval was Cemiplimab, which was superior in NSCLC patients with a dose of ≥50% of chemotherapy. There is currently no recommendation and no authorisation in this case for patients in Stadium III where radiochemotherapy cannot be performed. 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication of definitive local therapy) 314 Background 8.101 and 8.102 Regarding the duration of system therapy, only the study data are available which are generally available in 4 cycles of combination therapy from chemotherapy + ICI, followed by maintenance therapy up to progression or non-lerable toxicity. In the combination studies with atezolizumab 4 or 6 cycles of therapy were possible. In Phase III studies varied from ICI to duration of therapy.\n\nIn clinical studies, however, it is clear that in patients who have been treated with anti-mammary disease (e.g., epileptic disease) or epileptic disease (e.g., epileptic disease). In clinical studies, the clinical benefit may be limited to patients who have received A) all cycles of therapy by protocol, B) who are not more than one year after ICI stop progressed and C) in those patients who have received ICI therapy. However, it is still a major challenge in the individual case to decide when to stop ICI therapy if necessary. Conclusion: in palliative setting, the clinician should be given 4 cycles of chemo-ICI. In clinical studies, however, maintenance therapy should be followed individually by a continuation of ICI treatment. In clinical studies, ICI treatment can then be performed in individual cases up to the loss of clinical renal disease.\n\nThe incidence of adverse reactions of CTC grade ≥3 is similar to those of the total population without autoimmune disease [1115], patients with NSCLC [1111] had an incidence of adverse reactions [1115].\n\nThe incidence of immuno-related adverse reactions was similar to that of HIV patients in general.\n\nIn addition, two prospective studies showed a good tole- rables safety profile without viral reactivation, as well as good activity in advanced tumours, including the NSCLC [1127]. ICI therapy can hypothetically even increase HIV specific immunity, as the immune system strengthened by immunotherapy can destroy HIV reservoirs that remain in the body despite retroviral therapy [1056]. It is recommended to closely monitor CD4 and CD8 during ICI therapy. Background Non-ICI-based therapies If an ICI-based therapy is out of the question, but the patient is in a normal general state (ECOG 0-1) then a platinum-based chemotherapy or monotherapy is to be offered in individual cases.\n\nIn view of the absolute median survival prolongation, the evaluation of the general condition and the patient preference of cispatione-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-dipledipine-diplediline-diplediline-diplediline-dipledipine-diline-diplediline-diplediline-diplediline-diline-diplediline-diplediline-diplediline-diline-diplediline-diplediline-diline-diplediline-diline-diplediline-diplediline-dipine-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diplediline-diline-dilinediline-diline-diline-diline-dilinediline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-diline-di\n\nThis metaanalysis was updated on the basis of individual patient data and results in the same outcome with respect to clinical effectiveness [1098]. Treatment duration In two randomized studies, the time duration of chemotherapy was examined. One study should show a difference in the 6-month survival rate of > 33% and the median survival time (MÜZ) from 4 to 6 months compared with 3 versus 6 cycles of mitomycin/vinblastin/ cisplatin. A difference was not established (MÜZ 6 versus 7 months; p = 0.2); however, in the comparative arm only 31% of the patients received 6 cycles of chemotherapy [1129]. In the case of disease progression, a difference in the 1-year survival rate of 15% was observed. The administration of 4 cycles of carboplatin/ paclitaxel versus continued administration of carboplatin/ paclitaxel was not demonstrated for either treatment period.\n\nHowever, in the case of patients who had been treated with the disease, there was no evidence of survival of the disease.\n\nIn the first study (JMEN) the treatment was improved after 4 cycles of a combination chemothera-pie and in the absence of progress in a pemetrexed or placebo arm.\n\nThe first dose was increased in the first dose. The first dose was increased in the first dose in the first dose. The first dose was increased in the first dose in the second dose. The second dose was increased in the second dose in the second dose. The second dose was increased in the second dose in the second dose.

Subgroup analyses for gemcitabine, paclitaxel and docetaxel also remained without significant survival benefit. Another subgroup (meta) analysis of 6 randomised studies showed a significant survival benefit for carboplatin when low cisplatin doses (40-80 mg/m2) were used in the comparative arm (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03-1.28).",

The question whether the avoidable differences in platinum derivatives with respect to efficacy and tolerability are emphasized or weakened by the increase of one (or two) ICI in initial line therapy remains to be answered at this stage.

Out of 797 patients there were 159 in PS2 patients, the subgroup analysis was not scheduled for Sweeney 2001, ECOG-2 subgroup [1155]: In the ECOG study in 1594, the various platinous combinations were included in the BP2 population (Cis/Pacli vs. Cis/Gem vs. Cis/Doce vs. Carbo/Pacli).\n\nOne of the more significant differences in the combination group was:\n\nIn this subgroup of EGFR_FISH positive tumours (n=32) the PFS was significantly prolonged. • ABOUND-PS2 study: In the ABOUND-PS2 study, only chemo-therapy-naive patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC were included, who had an ECOG2 (n=40) and carboplatin (n=40) were given.\n\nIn the first half of the year, there was a significant increase in the number of patients who had been treated with EGG2 in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, there was a decrease in the number of patients who had been treated with EG2 in the second half of the year. In the second half of the year, a decrease in the number of patients who had been treated with EG2 in the second half of the year was reported.\n\nIn the case of combination therapy, it is clear that cisplatin in addition to gemcitabine improved its survival in PS 2. D) Metaanalysis • A metaanalysis of Mörth et al. 2014 [1165], which showed the efficacy and tolerability of a monotherapy or combination first-line therapy in the case of progression NSCLC in PS 2, came to the conclusion that the platinum-containing combination therapy had a significant survival benefit (HR 0.79) in comparison with monotherapy.\n\nTwo phase II studies (longer, lily tree) are used to treat the disease of the disease (e.g., the disease of the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease of the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease of the disease of the disease of the disease of the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease of the disease of the disease, the disease of the disease of the disease of the disease of the disease.\n\nGenetic alterations are associated with smoking status, but the sole testing of patients who have never or only lightly smoked (under 10 pack years and more than 15 years of smoking stop) would result in 1/3 of the mutati- ents not being detected [1168]. Therefore, it is recommended that all patients with NSCLC should be tested on EGFR receptor mutations regardless of smoking status, including patients with squamous cell carcinoma, regardless of smoking status. Testing on EGFR mutations must be performed prior to initiation of first-line therapy. For recommendations on molecular pathological testing, see Chapter 6.6.10 8.6 Stage IV (without indication for definitive local therapy).",

In the course of this study, the patient's survival rate was significantly higher than that of the patient's survival rate. In the course of this study, the patient's survival rate was significantly higher than that of the patient's survival rate. In the case of patients with a history of lung carcinoma, the data can be adapted accordingly. Studies on cost-benefit analyses, which are tailored to the German or Austrian health system, are not yet available at this time, but it can be assumed that similar results are available here. Aftercare with less intensive examination methods versus follow-up care with intensive examination methods Virgo et al. examined retrospectively with different follow-up strategies. In the one group, an intensive routine follow-up with annual appointments were performed.\n\nThis study was discussed at least in the post-mortem follow-up study. In this prospective analysis, however, it is not clear whether this survival extension in analogy to the screening studies is a lead time bias effect. In the meantime, the results of the randomized IFCT study ([1755]) have been presented internationally, but they are not quite clearly classified. Thus, in the first three to four years due to the structuring imaging follow-up studies there was no difference in the survival data. However, after four post-mortem follow-up/follow-up 484 to five-years there was a clear, significant difference in the discovery and diagnosis of secondary tumours. These can then be treated again in part a curative manner.\n\nFor example, for the treatment of brain metastases, there is an urgent need for the treatment of brain metastases in post-care and the importance of outcome survival. However, this point is not recommended in risk situations with LD-SCLC, ED-SCLC, and especially in the question of using PCI or alternatively imaging observation with PCI or stereota xie of metastases. On the contrary, MUSS here in a chosen observation strategy as in the Japanese study with ED-SCLC, an MRI skull is to be performed every three months. This must be taken into account in the choice of a watch and wait procedure with ALK-Translocation, with ROS-1 and IVB NSCLC risk collectives are extended in these new areas.",

In the case of patients who have been treated with the disease, there is an increase in the incidence of disease due to age-related chronic diseases in an ageing population. In the case of the most frequent localisations of malignant new formations (intestinal, lung, prostate, mamma), there is an increase in the incidence of new diseases in all the regions. However, at the age of 65, there is an increase in the risk of multimorbidity. This also shows an analysis of the Robert-Koch-Institute from the year 2012. In the case of the age of the disease, only about one in five patients who have been treated with the disease has been diagnosed with the disease. At the age of 65, more than half of all people are affected by the disease. In the case of patients who have been diagnosed with the disease, more than 10 patients who have been diagnosed with the disease.\n\nFor example, in the case of breast cancer, a study has already shown the advantage of ‘softer' chemotherapy over current chemotherapy [1761]. In a position paper, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, the International Society for Geriatric Oncology and the Alliance for Clinical Studies in Oncology advocate the inclusion of both fit and elderly and fragile patients in cancer studies. Studies specifically for older cancer patients should become mandatory if the standard therapy differs from that in younger patients. Therefore, the experts in the paper recommend smaller studies, possibly without a control group, in order to determine the effectiveness and toxicity of their older and comorbid patients [1762]. As long as there are no corresponding studies and thus no evidence, the ex- perten are forced to make possible adjustments after a reasoned justification in the sense of therapy modifications in favour of their elderly and comorbid patients.",
