14 April 2023 of the President of the Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Technologies and Tarification in the evaluation of Lumykras (sotorasib) in the context of the drug programme • Treatment of lung cancer (ICD-10:C 34) and of the interstitial lung disease (ICD-10:C 45) • The President of the Agency does not recommend the inclusion of a refund of Lumykras (sotorasib) in the existing drug programme for the treatment of lung cancer under the proposed conditions. The reason for the recommendation Evaluation concerns the refund of sotorasib in the treatment of II and subsequent lines of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NDRP) from the presence of p.G 12 C in the control of Lumykras (sotorasib) in the existing drug programme.

The following procedures may be used in subsequent treatment lines in patients who have not previously been treated with immunotherapy: such procedures limit the reliability of the request for clinical performance of the evaluated technology against all available comparators. According to estimates of economic analysis, the incremental indicator of utility (ICUR) from the perspective of the NFZ is the threshold of profitability The proposed drug is also taken into account that according to estimates of budgetary impact analysis, the frequent refund of Lumykras will cause expenditure of the public payer, in a variant of about 1 year and about in the 2nd year of the refund, the reliability of the above results is associated with the assumed assumptions of the population of patients and future participation of the SOT in the given market for drugs It should be noted that the number of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the case of Lumykras treated in the drug program B.

This is a justification for the practice of partitioning into DRP and non-small cell lung cancers (NDRP) NDRP differs from other histological types in that it develops more slowly and is characterised by limited chemical sensitivity EGFR mutations, ALK gene re-arrangements and mutations in ROS 1 genes are considered as molecular changes of clinical significance. Lung cancer is the most common cancer in Poland and the first cause of cancer death is approximately 20% and 10% of all cancers in men and women respectively (approximately 15,000 and 7000 cancers per year in recent years) and causes approximately 30% and 17%, respectively in men and women, of all cancer-related deaths 26,000 deaths in 2020. Total 5-year survival is ~10% of patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (operative and not operated together)

The proportion of 5 years of experience after complete resection of non-small cell carcinoma in grades I, II and IIIA is 60.80%, 40.50% and 15.25% respectively, and in patients receiving stage III radio ((chemio) therapy ~20%. Alternative medical technology Taking into account clinical guidelines and technologies currently funded by public funds as comparators for the requested technology, docetaxel, nintedanib with docetaxel; pemetrexed and bipolar chemotherapy based on platinum. The selection of comparators is considered appropriate. However, it should be noted that according to the records of the drug program C.6 contains the least known cause of lung cancer (ICD-10: C 34) and pleural mesothelioma (ICD-10: C 45) , athezolizumab or nivolumab can be used in subsequent courses of treatment in patients not previously treated with immunotherapy. Therefore, the extent of therapy is wider than that provided in the evaluation process.

Based on the above, the efficacy and safety assessment allows to obtain a response to a question about the extent of the health effect (both in terms of efficacy and safety) that should be expected with respect to new therapy compared to other therapeutic options considered.Sotorasib efficacy and safety (SOT) was assessed compared with docetaxel (DOC) The number of patients: SOT 171, DOC 174; Median follow-up period: 17,7 months; Phase 1 (Nintedanib in combination with docetaxel) The number of patients was added to clinical analysis: • Brea K 100, Phase II:

In the Code Brea K 200 study, the overall risk 1 Quarter spacing (ang interquartile range) Recommendation No 41/2023 of the President of AOTMI T of 14 April 2023, the systematic error was defined as low in most domains and the unknown risk occurred in the randomization process The LUME-Lung study 1 is characterised by a low risk of systematic error. The single-arm study Code Brea K 100 and the actual efficacy study Awad 2022, evaluated at 7/8 points on the NICE 2, and the Julve 2021 and Cadranel 2022 on the NICE score 4/8 points. The primary endpoints (PK) in the studies are: • the free from progression (PFS) • the Brea K 200; • the response to treatment (ORR) of the Brea K 100. The efficacy of SOT vs DOC (direct comparison) The statistically significant differences (IS) are: • the patients using SOT compared to the DOC study range: • the progression-free survival (ORR) of the general population: SOT mediana 5,5 (95% 0.5)

Respiratory function, cough, coughing of blood, shortness of breath during rest and exercise, hair loss, chest pain) Higher performance for functional scales means deterioration of function, and in the case of general health condition, improvement of quality of life. Recommendation No 41/2023 of the President of AOTMI T of 14 April 2023. No statistically significant differences were observed between groups for e.g.: • overall survival, • other endpoints in EORTC QLQ-C 30 and EORTC QLQ-LC 13 (e.g. time to worsening of chest pain).In the different groups using SOT were achieved results for progression-free survival: • in the subpopulation after two previous courses of treatment: SOT vs DOC 5,7 months vs 4.8 mies HR (95% CI) = 0,61 (0.40; 0.92) • in the subpopulation in the state of ECOG 1: SOT vs 4,4 months vs (0.5 months HR (95% CI) = 0,64 months without S.4; • in the subpopulation of 0.52 ms volts to 0.5.4 ms volts volts of 0.5.

In individual SOT treatment groups, results were obtained for overall response: • in subpopulation after two previous treatment lines: SOT vs DOC 40% vs 17% OR (95% OR) = 3.10 (1.39, 6.92) • in subpopulation at ECOG 0: SOT vs DOC 34% vs 14% OR (95% CI) = 4.02 (1.44, 11.17) • in subpopulation at ECOG 1: SOT vs 13% OR (95% CI) = 2.16 (1.07, 4.34) • in subpopulation with OUN metastases or without: SOT vs DOC 28% vs 10% OR (95% CI) = 3.33 (1.20, 9.28) in non-voltative studies; SOT vs 3.1% vs DOC 28% vs 15% OR (95% CI) = 2.30 (1.17, 4.51) • in subpopulation without liver metastases: without relapses SOT, 3.1% volts, 31% volts

SOT vs Pemetrexed Based on ESMO guidelines and randomized clinical trials submitted during the assessment of the refund application for Keytruda (Recommendation No 3/2017 of the President of the Agency), it was indicated that Pemetrexed and docetaxel did not differ in relation to overall survival, progression-free survival and response to SOT vs dual therapy based on platinum (P-CTH) study (see Table 9) Results of Brea K 100 studies (most patients received in prior P-CTH and immunotherapy studies) and Cortellini 2021 (most patients received prior pembrolizumab immunotherapy line).

In the study, 3 patients died in the SOT group (interstitial lung disease), 2 in the DOC group (intestinal obstruction, multiorgan failure). Adverse events at ≥3 degree of severity and adverse events associated with treatment were statistically significant in the SORAsib group compared to the docetaxel group (95%Cl) = 1.19 (1.01; 1.40) and RR (95%CI) = 2.33 (1.52; 3.57). Statistically significant adverse events related to the SORASib group compared to the docetaxel group occurred: • adverse events related to the treatment of overall events (95% Cl) = 0.82 (0.73; 0.92) • adverse events related to the treatment of dose modification (RR (95% Cl) = 0.58 (0.37; 0.90) • Serious adverse events related to the treatment (SAE) were reported with the treatment of 12 events.

In patients using SOT, constipation (13% vs 5%) and anaemia (17% vs 5%) were more frequent: fatigue (16% vs 30%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (11% vs 26%), increased alanine aminotransferase (11% vs 29%), alopecia (2% vs 16%), alopecia (2% vs 16%), and fever (7% vs 13%). Practical efficacy studies In a study of Julve 2021, adverse events (AE) were reported in a total of 44% of patients, AE ≥ 3 degrees, AEs leading to dose reduction in 19%. In a study of Awad 2022, AEs related to total therapy were reported in 65% of patients, AEs related to treatment ≥3 degrees of patients, AE associated with treatment for discontinuation of therapy in 7% of patients, AEs associated with treatment for dose modification of 26% of patients, AEs related to treatment to fatality in 1% (1 with adverse effect of pulmonary infection), SAEs related to treatment in 26% of patients.

Thus, the Brea K 200 study allowed cross-over from docetaxel to sotorasib, which may affect the results of the survival analysis obtained. The above significantly translates into the credibility of the conclusion. Proposals of risk sharing instruments Economic evaluation, including the estimate of costs to obtained health effects Economic assessment consists in estimating and comparing the costs and health effects that may be associated with the use of new therapy in a single patient instead of therapy already reimbursed.The cost of therapy is estimated in the currency of our country, and the health effects are most frequently expressed in the perspective of the gained years of life (LYG, life years guaranteed) or in the years of life lived in full health (QALY, quality adjusted life years) due to the use of the therapy.The summary of the cost and effects of using the new therapy and comparing them to the cost and effects of therapy already reimbursed allows to obtain a response to a question whether the health effect obtained from a single patient due to a new therapy is due to a higher cost in comparison with the analysis of the cost-to-life ratio (the effect of the potential of the potential of the potential of the patient) is to the patient (in the patient) in the case of the potential of the patient (in which is due to the patient) in the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case

If the clinical analysis of the applicant does not include randomized clinical studies demonstrating the superiority of the medicine over the medical technologies previously reimbursed in the indication concerned, then the official selling price of the medicinal product must be calculated in such a way that the cost of the application of the medicinal product applied for the refund is not higher than the cost of the medical technology with the most favourable rate of the health effects obtained to the costs thereof. In the opinion of the Agency there are no circumstances of Article 13 of the Refund Act. The assessment of the impact on the health care system, including the public payer's budget The assessment of the impact on the health care system consists of two essential parts. Firstly, in the analysis of the impact on the payer's budget, it is possible to evaluate the potential expenditure related to the financing of the new therapy from the public request.

The possibility of using Pemetrexed and dual-drug chemotherapy based on platinum was omitted. Among the restrictions should also indicate the uncertainty regarding the number of populations that would apply the proposed therapy, and the predicted shares of sotorasib These values were based on, among other things: the opinion of clinical experts There is no actual number of patients with the presence of p.G 12C mutation in KRAS at the current frequency of genetic tests among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NDRP) The costs of additional genetic therapy if the drug is included in the refund will also affect the expenditure of the public payer. The lack of credibility is also affected by the limitations of clinical and economic analysis. The comments to the proposed risk-sharing instrument The proposed solution should be considered insufficient to mitigate the risk associated with the potential funding of the assessed public drug technology.

As other therapeutic options it is indicated chemotherapy associated with platinum compounds (patients after progression after the first line of treatment with monotherapy inhibitors) and adagrasib (the alternative to FDA-registered therapy, not registered by EMA). According to the guidance of the NCCN 2023 in the second line of treatment of patients with NDRP mutation of KRAS G 12 C is indicated for the possibility of using prior systemic treatment or adagrasib (after at least one prior therapy aimed at the mutation of KRAS G 12 C). According to the advice of the PTOK 2022 procedure in the second line of treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer depends on the clinical-pathologic characteristics, effects of early treatment with Bretorasib or adagrasib (after at least one previous treatment for the mutation of KRAS G 12C).
