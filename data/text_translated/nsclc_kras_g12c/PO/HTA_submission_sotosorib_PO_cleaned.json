Uncertainty of the above results is related to the assumptions on the number of patients and future shares of SOT in the drug market under consideration. It should be noted that the number of patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated in the B.6 drug program is increasing and therefore an increase in expenditure can be expected in the following years. Evaluations carried out by other HTA agencies indicate uncertainty in terms of efficacy and profitability estimates, therefore it is necessary to provide the final results of the studies. The guidelines indicate the possibility of using sotorasib in the second line of treatment of patients with the KRAS G12C (PTOK 2022, ESMO 2023, NCCN 2023, the condition of the patient's potential for the treatment of lung disease in the Council.",

Typical symptoms include reduced respiratory function or shortness of breath, chest pain, haemoptysis or frequent pneumonia. Primary lung cancer is a cancer derived from epithelial cells. The most commonly diagnosed are 4 types of histology: • prostate cancer (45% - an increase in incidence in the last period); • squamous cell carcinoma (30%); • small cell carcinoma (15%); • large cell carcinoma (10%). Small cell lung cancer (DRP) is different from other types of histology in terms of biological and clinical characteristics (high rate of proliferation, short time of tumour doubling, occology and relative toxicity).",

A rationalization analysis is submitted if the analysis of the impact on the budget of the entity obliged to finance benefits from the public funds indicates an increase in the cost of the refund.
