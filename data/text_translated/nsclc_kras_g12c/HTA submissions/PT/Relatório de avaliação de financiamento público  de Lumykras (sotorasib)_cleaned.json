      "text": "Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide (excluding non-melanocytic skin neoplasms) and a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Globally, only 18% of patients will survive 5 years or more after diagnosis of the disease. A majority of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage (not curable), although os incidence and mortality numbers are very similar. O lung cancer is diagnosed mainly after 65 years of age, with a median age of diagnosis in the next 70 years. Tobacco is still the main risk factor, causing 85 to 90% of lung cancer cases. In countries that have implemented effective anti-cancer measures, the prevalence of new cases of lung cancers has decreased over the past 5 years. Among all KRAS mutations, a variation of the mono-nucleotide p.G12C, with glycine substituted by cysteine without codon 12, is the most frequent variant, with a prevalence of approximately 7 to 12% in CPNPC and 13% in adenocarcinomas.",

      "text": "LUMYCRAS (sotorasib) is a covalent and irreversible inhibitor of the KRAS G12C cysteine. The inactivation of MEDTERm011G12C by MEDTER M004 blocks the signaling, inhibits growth and promotes selective apoptosis in MEDTER G011C carrier tumors, with minimal detectable activity for this purpose. The treatment, to date, consists of the only inhibitor approved by the European Medicines Agency, at a dosage of 960 mg/ day, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is measured. nintedanib is a triple inhibitor of superior angiocinase that blocks the kinase activity of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR 1-3), the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (GPDFR α e ß) and the cell-robot growth factor 12 (FGFR 1-3).1 Posology: 75 mg/ m2 IV, 21/ 21 days; up to disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. However, only recently, it has been possible to robustly assess the prevalence of the p.G12C mutation in patients with CPNPC. For this, it is necessary to refer to the AACR GENIE registry, an international registry with information from the 19 main cancer treatment centers in the world. In this MEDTERM9 (sotorasib) registry there are a total of 13,243 new diagnoses of CPCPN, of which about 29,0% (n=3838) present a mutation of the MEDM11M, and 12,016 (n = 12,041) are diagnosed annually in Portugal. On the basis of the previously available data from the Portuguese Instituto de Medicina Portuguesa (Portugal), it is estimated that the CPNPN is positively mutated in 46% of patients diagnosed each year.",

      "text": "All os studies were considered relevant for the present evaluation, namely the CodeBreaK 100 and 200 studies conducted prior to, during, or at the beginning of the study (MEDTERM 019 and CodeBreeK 100), a systematic review of the literature, a study of indirect comparison of the substrate with MEDTERN006, and a phase 3 clinical trial to compare AMG 510 with MEDDERM006 with CPNPC with mutation MEDTERRM012 p.G.C. (CodeBREK 200 study). all MEDTER M019 trials were considered to be relevant for this evaluation. all MEDM021 studies were evaluated on the basis of a combination of the following three criteria: MEDERM 020 and MEDER M012M01, which were either positive or negative. The study included an exploratory analysis of QoL, two questionnaire responses from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTCL Q-C30), the Quality of Life Questionnaire on Lung Cancer 13 (EorTCLQ L13) and a visual scale study (EuroVision 5-Dimension Dimension Control (CD); time to response; Sobrevida Livre de Progresso (SLP); Sobrevda Global (SG). This study was evaluated as a safety assessment of Adverse Effects (AEs) based on version 5 of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The study was monitored for futility with analyses performed continuously with the use of Bayesian predictive probability, starting after 25 patients completed at least 7 weeks of the trial and occurring after every 10 additional patients could be evaluated for response after completing at least seven weeks of trial. The criterion for continuation was at least 80% probability that a true response rate exceeded the reference rate and for suspension the probability of achieving the target was less than 5%. os results of the studies include a survival rate (including a global survival (MEDTERM 019), a survivability without progression (MedTERM 015) and a survivorship without events (EFS), a tempo de progresão (Medterm 017), o tempo para o próximo tratamento (TTNT), as taxas de resposta, a taxa de controle da doença, a duração do tratamento e MEDTERm 019 eventos adversos. MEDTER M019 studies were identified through pesadas bases de dados eletrônicas, listas de referências de artigos relevantes, processos de conferências e excluídas outras fontes suplementares. 8.2 Data extraction sheets Dos 8489_Amgen_NSCL 17 unique studies identified, eight not including docetaxel como um braço de tratamento e nove C_DET_KRASm studies _ 2021 SLR update_v2.xlsx não apresentavam uma informação necessária, nomeadamente as curvas Kaplan-Meier na população de interesse, para realizar uma comparação indireta não ancorada, através da metodologia MAIC. Assim, apenas o estudo SELECT-1 preencheu MEDterM019 requisitos necessários para a realização de uma comparativa original e d update search, therefore total included studies are less than the total of the original an update search. No eight, eight do not include MEDTER M006 as a treatment arm and nine C_ DET_ KRASM studies did not present a necessary information, namely as curves Kaplan - Meier in the population of interest, to carry out an indirect comparison not anchored, through the methodology MIC. Thus, only the SELECT-1 study does not meet the requirements for a comparison between the original and the updated studies, therefore, the total number of studies included is less than that of the initial and updated search. However, in light of the current population data, it is not expected that this population difference represents a significant prognostic or effect-modifying factor relevant to docetaxel.Though two studies were carried out to evaluate the efficacy of MEDTERm001, these four studies allowed the inclusion of patients with prior treatment.However, the SELECT-1 study was limited to only one prior treatment, in contrast to the CodeBreaK 100 study, which allowed up to three prior treatment lines.In addition, the MEDTER M019 study did not receive prior treatment with immunotherapy, contrary to what was verified by the majority of researchers in the total study, these two studies could not be expected to be associated with a covariant covariance indicator, but merely an indication of a concealed side effect.These four studies were evaluated through an independent evaluation methodology (MEDTERM100, MATERM200, MEDTERN100, MEDM100) performed by the independent reviewers; however, they were not evaluated for clinical relevance; they were assessed through a separate evaluation of the available data; and were not reviewed in accordance with the initial criteria of the MEDETERM001,1. Other additional covariates were considered in the two models of analysis of sensitivity (Model 1: expression of the protein PD-L1, sex (% female), histology in the initial evaluation (% non-white), race/ethnicity (% Caucasian); Model 2: number of lines of previous treatment). In the base analysis, the effective sample size (ESS) resulting was 108.9, representing a mean reduction of 14% compared to the original sample size of 126 patients. In the SELECT-1 study, 32% of patients treated with docetaxel suffered severe EA. On the other hand, 30% of patients suffered an EA that led to their hospitalisation. Relative to the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to toxicity, no study CodeBreaK 100, as discontinences of treatment due to EA emerging from treatment occurred in 11 (8.7%) patients, however, only in 9 (7.1%) patients these discontinous events were associated with EA related to treatment. A chemoradiation followed by planned systemic therapy (including checkpoint inhibitor) or vice versa with documented intermittent progression is considered a line of therapy to progress no more than 6 months after the end of treatment. An adjuvant therapeutic regimen is considered an advanced therapy line to progress another 6 months to the end. Each new systemic treatment regimen meticulously monitors the progressive progression of the systemic disease from the start of treatment to the beginning of treatment or until the patient receives a new treatment course, no further confirmation of disease progression or death is considered to occur. os eligible participants were 18 years of age and had locally advanced and irreversible or metastatic CPNPC mutation MEDterM012 p.G12C documented histologically and no other known mutation on which to conclude that a systemically approved therapeutic exists. The assessment of tumour progression and response had to be confirmed by the BICR; these assessments of disease progress and response were made without the knowledge of the attributions of randomization during the primary tertiary treatment, in accordance with MEDTERm009 v1.1, and are to be used for a primary analysis of the parameters. MEDTER M019 eligibility participants were aged 18 years and locally-advanced and unrecognizable or metastically-responsive CPNCPC mutations with a median P.G.G012C mutation documented historically and there were no other mutations on which a known systemically-approved treatment existed. A primary analysis of overall survival should have occurred when at least 198 os events (approximately 60% of maturity) had been observed, but an analysis of the last randomized individual had had an opportunity to have 6 weeks of follow-up, which occurred later. The available study report includes results from a data in which the first individual was randomized (June 04, 2020) to a data from the data for this primary analysis from MEDTER M015 (August 02, 2022).
