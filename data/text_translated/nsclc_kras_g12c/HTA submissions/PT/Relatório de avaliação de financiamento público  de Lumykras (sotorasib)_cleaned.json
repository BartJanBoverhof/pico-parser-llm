Globally, only 18% of patients will survive 5 years or more after diagnosis of the disease. A majority of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage (not curable), for which the incidence and mortality numbers are very similar. Lung Cancer is diagnosed mainly after 65 years of age, with a median age of diagnosis close to 70 years. Tobacco is still the main risk factor, causing 85 to 90% of lung cancer cases. In countries that have implemented effective anti-cancer measures, the prevalence of new cases of pulmonary cancer has decreased over the past five years.",

      "text": "LUMYCRAS (sotorasib) is a covalent and irreversible inhibitor of the cysteine endator of KRAS G12C. An inactivation of the KRASG12C by sotorasib blocks the signaling, inhibits growth and promotes selective apoptosis in tumors carrying KRAS-G12c, with minimal detectable activity outside this target. Treatment, to date, consists of the only inhibitor approved by the European Medicines Agency, at a dosage of 960 mg/day, until disease progression or toxicity is unacceptably high. A new drug has been developed that incorporates specific components of cancer. These drugs are termed as biological or therapeutic agents. Posology: Nintedanib: 200 mg PO 12/12h 20/21d [cannot be taken on day 1]; docetaxel: 75 mg/m2 IV, 21/21 days; until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Applying this additional filter to the previous estimate, we conclude that approximately 462 patients with CPNPC KRAS p.G12C positive in advanced stages will be diagnosed in Portugal annually.",

      "text": "All studies were considered relevant for the present evaluation, namely the CodeBreaK 100 and 200 studies conducted prior to the current study, and the study was conducted in conjunction with an ongoing multi-centre, open, single-arm, phase I/II diagnostic study (CodeBreakK 100), a systematic review of the literature, an indirect comparison study with docetaxel, and a phase 3 clinical trial for comparison of AMG 510 with Docetaxel in combination with CPNPC with mutation KRAS p.G.G12C (CodebreaK 200 study).All studies were deemed relevant for this evaluation; all studies were evaluated on the basis of three criteria: adverse drug reactions (ADR, ADC, ADR, OCD, ADROC, OPC, ADSL, OCP, OPSC, CDL, OCSC, CRISPR, or CRISP) based on a number of monotherapeutically validated indicators as primary indications for the treatment of OCD I/OC with a mutation of KRAS P.G 12C. For efficacy indicators related to a response to treatment, a population with at least one dose of treatment with sotorasib and at least a lesson identified in the initial evaluation of the study was considered. The efficacy and safety indicators were evaluated in all patients with a dose of therapy with soturasib. A committee with concealed (blinded) and independent evaluators monitored the efficacy study. A panel of 105 patients was planned to be included in Phase II of the CodeBreaK 100 study, to obtain a 90% efficacy in detecting an objective response (primary indicator) superior to 23%, a response with a significance level of 5%. This predicted value of 23% was withdrawn from the objective response observed in the treatment arm as observed by systematic randomised controlled trials, in combination with a preclinical study, in a Phase III study with no safety indicator evaluated. A 95% probability of failure was estimated for all patients receiving at least 1 dose of somatropinase-containing treatment. The studies were identified through the search of electronic databases, reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and other supplementary sources. A RSL complied with the published guidelines issued by the Cochrane Collaboration and by the Centre for Reviews & Dissemination (CRD; York, United Kingdom) and was in total conformity with the methodological requirements of the Instituto Nacional de Saúde e Excelência em Cuidados Excluídos (INSEE), the Tempo de Progresso (TTP), and the Tempo para o Próximo Tratamento (TTNT), as taxas de resposta, a taxa de controle da doença, a duração do tratamento e os acontecimentos adversos. The main reasons identified were lack of additional comparators of interest (76.5%, n=13); lack of crucial information for a realization of MAIC in a population of interest (KRAS G12C), or in an enlarged population of KRAS mutated (23.5%), n=4) Thus, the only indirect comparison considered viable in patients with CPNPC advanced KRAS or KRAS g12C mutated, previously treated, was a comparison of sotorasib versus docetaxel, based on the results of the study CodeB 100 (sasiotarb) and SELECT-1 (docetaxel). Other additional covariates were considered in the two models of sensitivity analysis (Model 1: PD-L1 protein expression, sex (% female), histology at initial evaluation (% non-small), race/ethnicity (% Caucasian); Model 2: number of previous treatment lines; Model 2: SECT study (45% non-toxicity study, 5% non-communicable disease, 15% non-invasive, 4% non-contagious, 10% non-exposed)); and Model 2: Number of prior treatment lines. In the analysis base, the effective sample size (ESS) was 108.9%, representing a mean reduction of 14% compared to the original sample size of 126 patients. The report presented by TAIM describes the results of the study after a primary analysis of the primary objective of efficacy of PFS, when approximately 230 PFS events occurred, while the study continued as planned. The following study was planned to take place at study centers around the world, including approximately 330 patients. The final treatment using either docetaxel or sotorasib after progression of the disease occurred in accordance with the systemic criteria of the investigator, as well as crossover between groups of patients allowed to follow oseltamibe or osletamibe for at least 6 months after receiving a new treatment regimen (Advanced Therapeutic Progress Line A) or a new therapy regimen for patients receiving advanced neurodegenerative disease (advanced therapy line A) (including methotrexate vs. non-progressive therapy line B) after 6 months of prior treatment. A number of patients were not considered to be admissible to advanced therapy (such as patients who had received a local treatment plan) or to receive a new therapeutical treatment plan (ABSP) within the previous 6 months. As tumour evaluations were performed during the follow-up every 6 weeks from cycle 1 day until week 49 and, subsequently, at intervals of 9 weeks until independent central confirmation of progression, initiation of other anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, loss of follow up or death, which should have occurred first. The examinations of the patients should have been subjected to independent central confirmed progression at the time of the first progressive disease. Patients who received treatment for beyond progression or crossing of docetaxel for sotorhabase continued to receive examinations after confirmation of first progressing disease. A tumour response evaluation was confirmed by the BICR in August; these evaluations of progress and response were based on knowledge attributed to the random systematic knowledge of the disease, according to RISTEC v1.1, and were conducted using a randomised tertiary screening method for both patients occurring at the same time as the initial progression of disease. A primary analysis of overall survival should occur when at least 198 OS events (approximately 60% of maturity) had been observed, but an analysis of the ORR was Lumykras (Sotorasib) planned for the moment in which a PFS was considered statistically significant, and the last randomized participant had had an opportunity to have at least 12 weeks of follow-up.
