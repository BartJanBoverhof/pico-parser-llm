      "text": "The assessment concerns the refund of sotorasib in the treatment of II and subsequent lines of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NDRP) with the presence of p.G12C mutation in the KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) after failure of at least one previous line of treatment in the existing drug program B.6 The proposed drug is also taken into account that according to the estimates of the budgetary impact analysis, the reimbursement of Lumykras will result in expenditure of the public payer, in the option of about 1 year and about 2nd year of refund. Uncertainty of the above results is related to assumed assumptions regarding the number of patients and future shares of SOT in the drug market under consideration. It should be noted that the proportion of patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated in the B.6 drug programme is increased and therefore an increase in expenditure may be expected in subsequent years. Evaluations carried out by other HTA agencies indicate uncertainty regarding the efficacy of the medicine and cost-effectiveness estimates, therefore it is necessary to provide the final results of the studies. The guidelines indicate the possibility of using sotorasib in the second line of treatment of patients of NDRP with a KRAS G12C mutation (PTOK 2022, ESMO 2023, NCCN 2023 v2).",

Typical symptoms include reduction of respiratory function or shortness of breath, chest pain, haemoptysis or frequent pneumonia. Primary lung cancer is a cancer derived from epithelial cells. The most common are 4 types of histology: • glandular cancer (45% - increase in incidence in the last period); • squamous cell carcinoma (30%); • small cell carcinoma (15%); − large cell carcinoma (10%). Small cell lung cancers (DRP) are different from other histological and clinical types (high rate of proliferation, short time of tumour doubling; − exceptional tendency to early metastases, chemocell carcinomas and relative radius).",

The choice of comparators was considered to be appropriate. However, it should be noted that according to the provisions of the B.6 drug program, lung cancer treatment (ICD-10: C34) and pleural mesothelioma (IC D-10:C45) , athezolizumab or nivolumab may be used in subsequent treatment lines in immunotherapy-naïve patients. Therefore, the scope of treatment is wider than that shown in the evaluation process.",

According to the Summary of Product Characteristics (ChPL) Lumykras monotherapy is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NDRP) with the potential for disease progression after at least one previous line of therapy. The proposed indication of safety is included in the registration indication. The assessment of efficacy (clinical and practical) and safety is based on the collection of data on the health consequences (effect and safety) of the use of this medicinal product, which may be due to the application of a new treatment with a particular medical condition and other appropriate therapy. Julve 2021 - Retrospective study of patients with metastatic lung cancer and expressing other efficacious function PD-L1 ≥ 50%. Number of patients: P-CTH 241. The analysis is also included in the analysis of the practical effectiveness: • Jul ve 2021 - retrospectative examination of the renal failure of the patient.

In the 2nd line of treatment, the median of 4.2 months (2.8; 4.5); for a general response: total population 5%; for the 2st line of therapy 5%. SOT vs Pemetexed Based on ESMO guidelines and randomized clinical trials prior to the assessment of a refundal application for Keytruda (recommendation No 3/2017 of the President that Pemetrexed and docetaxel do not differ from each other in terms of progression-free survival and response.SOT vs dual therapy based on platinum derivative (P-CTH) (recommended summary of the results of the studies CodeBreaK 100 (mostly of the patient in previous lines of therapy P-Cth and immunotherapy) and Cortellini 2021 (i.e. received in the previous line of medical therapy in the 1st column of treatment median, in the 2rd line). In the study, 3 patients died of SOT (interstitial lung disease), 2 in the DOC group (ileus, multiorgan failure). Adverse events ≥3 degree of severity and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation occurred statistically significantly more frequently in the sotorasib group compared to the docetaxel group [RR (95%Cl) = 1.19 (1.01; 1.40) and RR (95%CI) = 2.33 (1.52; 3.57).

Practical efficacy studies In the study of Julve 2021, adverse events (AE) were reported in 44% of patients, AE ≥3. degree of AE leading to dose reduction in 19%. In the publication of Awad 2022, AE related to total treatment, AE associated with treatment ≥ 33% of patients; AE associated therapy associated with discontinuation of therapy in 7% of patients and AE related with dose modification of patients. The CodeBreaK 200 study allowed cross-over from docetaxel to sotorasib, which may affect the results of the survival analysis obtained.",

      "text": "The economic evaluation, including the estimate of the costs to the health effects obtained The economic assessment consists of assessing and comparing the costs and health effects that can be associated with the use of a new therapy in a single patient instead of therapy already reimbursed.The cost of therapy is estimated in the currency of our country, and the health outcomes are expressed most frequently in the years of life (LYG, life years guaranteed) or in years of living fully healthy (QALY, quality of treatment administered life years) due to treatment.The summary of the values and effects associated with using the new therapy (for example, compared to the cost and effects of the therapy already refunded), allows for an answer to the question whether the health effect obtained in the individual patient through the new treatment involves a higher cost than the one already reimbursed therapy.The obtained results of the cost-health effect index compare with the so-called cost-effectiveness threshold, i.e. the result of which the cost should indicate that when the cost is available to our country (expressed in GDP) the maximum cost of the treatment which is due to obtain the individual health effect (1 LYG or 1 QALY) the cost of health). In the absence of any other information, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for the use of the medicinal product. If the clinical analysis of the applicant does not include randomized clinical studies demonstrating the superiority of the medicine over the medical technologies previously reimbursed in the indication concerned, then the official selling price of the medicinal product must be calculated in such a way that the cost of the application of the drug applied for the refund is not higher than that of the basic medical technology with the most favourable rate of health effects obtained to the costs of obtaining them. In the opinion of the Agency there are no circumstances of Article 13 of the Act on reimbursement. The assessment of the impact on the health system, including the budget of the public payer's evaluation of the effects on the healthcare system is made up of two essential parts. First, in the analysis of an impact on a patient's budget, it is possible to assess whether the new therapy will be related to a new treatment. In the second year of the refund, and in the variant, the results of sensitivity analysis indicate that restrictions on the budgetary impact were not taken into account for all indicated comparators for the requested technology. Estimates were made for docetaxel and nintedanib's association with docetaxel. The possibility of treatment with Pemetrexed and dual-drug chemotherapy based on platinum derivatives was omitted. Among the limitations should also indicate the uncertainty regarding the population size that would be applied to the proposed therapy and the predicted shares of sotorasib. These values are based, among others, on the opinion of clinical experts. No actual number of patients with p.G12C mutation in the KRAS gene at the current frequency of genetic tests in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NDRP). The cost of additional genetic tests if a refund is included will also affect the public payer's expenditure. The limited reliability is also affected by the limitations of clinical and economic analysis. Notes to the suggested risk sharing instrument The proposed solution should be considered insufficient to mitigate the risk associated with potential financing of the assessed drug technology.",

The provision of exclusion of co-emergence of other malignancies is one of the criteria for eligibility for an analyzed drug programme. Discussion of the solutions proposed in the rationalization analysis The subject of rationalizational analysis is to identify a mechanism whose introduction will result in the release of public funds corresponding to at least an increase in costs resulting from a positive decision on the refund of the requested medical technology. A rationalization study is submitted if an analysis of the impact on the budget of the entity obliged to finance benefits from the public refund (PTOK 2022); • National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCNCN 2023 v2); • European Society for Medical Treatment of Patients is referred to in the following indication: • Polish Society of Clinical Oncology (Polish Medical Therapy) (POTA 2023); â National Compresive Cancer as well as the case of other countries (NCCN 2023v2). In this group, the use of chemotherapy (docetaxel or Pemetrexed), docetaxel in combination with nintedanib, EGFR inhibitors in patients who have not received these drugs in the first line, or ozimertinib in patients previously treated with EGFR-inhibitors of the first or second generation, ALK inhibitors in case of rearrangement of the ALK gene, immunotherapy (nivorumab or athezolizumab), palliative radiation therapy or symptomatic treatment. Refundal recommendations 4 positive refundal recommendations (NICE 2022, SMC 2022, HAS 2022, G-Ba 2022), three of them are conditional recommendations with time limitation (SMC 2022, HA 2022, HAS 2022, g-Ba222), and 1 negative recommendation (PBAC 2022).
