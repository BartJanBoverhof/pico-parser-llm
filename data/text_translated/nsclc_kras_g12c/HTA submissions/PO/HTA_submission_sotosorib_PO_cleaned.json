      "text": "The term lung cancer (code C34 according to the ICD-10 classification) refers to a group of cancers that are localized in the bronchi (breathing glands) and the lungs. Two typical symptoms are limited respiratory exhaustion or shortness of breath, pain in the chest, bleeding glands or frequent inflammation of the lung. The most frequently recognized are 4 histological types: • large cancer (45% - increase in frequency in the last period); • small cancer (30%); • muscle cancer (15%); • large breast cancer (10%). Droblastoma (DRP) is now recognized as different from other types of cancer due to its histological characteristics, including biological characteristics and clinical features. The overall five-year survival rate is ~10% for patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (including both operated and non-operated patients). The five year survival rates for patients with stage I, II, and IIIA non-symptomatic lung cancer are 6080%, 4050% and 1525%, respectively, and for patients in stage III receiving radiochemotherapy ~20%.",

      "text": "Economic evaluation, including estimation of costs of therapeutic health effects The economic evaluation consists in estimation and determination of the costs and health effects that may be associated with the use of a new therapy by an individual patient instead of a therapy already reimbursed.The estimated costs of therapy are based on the cost of treatment in our country, and the health effects are most likely to begin in the first years of life (LYG, life years gained) or in the last years of healthy life (QALY, quality adjusted life years) in the second year of therapy.The best estimated cost of therapy per patient is based on an assessment of the cost and effects of therapy already used in the individual patient's health, i.e. on the answer to the question of whether the treatment has a positive effect on the health of the patient.According to a study conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), medical treatment costs are estimated to be in the country's currency (175 USD/USD), while the financial costs of treatment should only be determined by the proportion of individual patients' health benefits to which the patient is financially responsible. The cost of chemotherapy based on the origin of platinum (P-CTH) is represented by the establishment of the cost of therapy. • Your cost of interventions and comparators, costs of treatment, costs for qualification for treatment, cost of treatment with other therapeutic lines, cost for diagnostics and monitoring, and costs for free treatment and palliative treatment. • Wyniki CUA for portions of SOT vs. DOC, NIN+DOC vs. SOT, SOT + PMX Incremental indications of the use of osplatny (MED) in combination with platyny (MET) • Costs of chemical interventions in comparison with the comparator (P+CTH), costs of qualified treatments in comparation with other treatments (MEM) • Cost of medicines used in the treatment of patients with chronic diseases (CMP) • Medical treatment costs in relation to patients who are receiving medical treatment. In addition, there is uncertainty regarding the accepted results of clinical effectiveness of comparative medical interventions, especially in terms of the total cost of treatment for the comparison of SOT vs DOC. In addition to this, there are also parts of comparators (atezolizumab, niwolumab), which according to the treaty of the medical program B.6 can be used in patients receiving immunotherapy in the first line. Interpreting the above results, it is necessary to take into account the limitations of the clinical analysis, which should also be considered in the economic analysis.

Based on this analysis, it is possible to evaluate whether the new therapy will involve the need to allocate higher resources to the treatment of the patient's health problem, or whether it will also involve savings in the budget of the health care provider. • Whether the cost of the new treatment will be associated with the necessity of allocating higher resources for treatment of patients' health problems and the availability of other health care providers. • The following indicators will be included in the analysis: • The cost of new therapy to the patient will be related to the need for the allocation of higher funds to treat the healthcare provider's problems, or the cost to the patients will be linked to the use of reduced resources in the health insurance provider' s budget. • In the context of the analysis of the proposed new therapy, it will be possible to re-evaluate the costs of the existing treatment. • A number of public healthcare providers will be reviewed annually by the Medical Research Council. The actual number of patients with the presence of p.G12C mutation in the KRAS gene at the current frequency of genetic testing in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (MEDTERM3003) is unknown. The cost of additional genetic testing for obtaining reimbursement of public health expenses is also uncertain. The limited availability of large-scale risk analyses for clinical risk assessment is also a major concern, and the proposed financial solution to address the financial risks associated with the use of this technology should be considered an economically feasible financial instrument.",
