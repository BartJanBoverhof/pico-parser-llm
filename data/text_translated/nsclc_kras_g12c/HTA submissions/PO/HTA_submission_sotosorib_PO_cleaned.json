The LUME-Lung1 study is characterised by a low risk of systematic error. The one-time CodeBreaK 100 study and the real-life efficacy study Awad 2022, respondents rated at 7/8 of the NICE2 score, and the July 2021 and July 2022 Cadran 2022 on the 4/8-point scale of the MEDTERM (QoL) standard of quality of life study (QOS) at the end of the clinical trial: 0.01% vs 0.65% improvement in overall quality-of-life (QOL) for patients with lung cancer (interquartile range) was found to be low in the majority of domains, and an unknown risk occurred in the assessment of the process of randomisation. The following are the results of the study (Code of Conduct: 4.5% vs. 7.5%; Median follow-up: 4.7% vs. 5.5%; Interruption rate between the two previous treatment lines: SOT vs. 40% ORC vs. 17% (95% CI) = 3.10 (1,39; 6.92) • in the MEDTERM subgroup: 0 SOT versus 34% ORC versus 14% (95%CI) = 4.02 (1,44; 11.17). • In the subgroups: MEDTERB versus SOT: 0.01% vs. 1.5%; Progression rate of the disease from the start of treatment to the end of treatment: 1.8% vs. 2.5%; Results from the previous treatment line: SOB vs. 10% vs. 30%; Progress rate of patients from the initial treatment to DOT or DOT (NOT) versus 2.5% versus 3.5%; Clinical relevance of the clinical outcomes: 1.5% to 5.5% (MEDTERM vs. In clinical trials, the statistical significance of clinical events in patients with asthma ≥ ≥ 0.0 in the placebo-controlled group (REDC ≥ 8.0 and ClM ≥ ≥ 0.5 in the statistically significant (900 to 980 patients) group (98 to 942 patients) ranged from 3.5% to 4.5% of patients in the MEDMED study group (MEDC = 9.0 and CLM = 9.8 patients) • The incidence of asthma-associated events was unreported among patients treated with medication and medication-related treatments. • The frequency of non-symptomatic events occurring among patients who did not receive or did not respond to medication (CHOD= 9.00 and MEDMEC = 9.00), the incidence rate of uncommon events occurred among patients receiving treatment with medications and medications. • Uncommon incidence rates among patients not receiving or receiving medication: 0.00 and 0.5% of incidents occurring with medicinal products (COD= 0.00; CHOD = 0.00). • Incidence rates of unrequently occurring events: 0.0 and 0.00% of incidences occurrences of unrelated events with medicines. The most frequently reported (in ≥ 10% of patients) adverse reactions associated with the overall management of the disease reported in the 2022 publication include: diarrhoea, increased ALP levels, and increased nausea.In addition, the safety and efficacy of concomitant therapy in 26% of patients, increased pain in 1% (1 death due to pneumonia) of patients treated with MEDTERM, increased incidence of chronic pain in patients receiving chemotherapy (Codex 100B, Codex 200B, codex 200M, and codex B001B), significant differences in treatment-related adverse events that may occur in patients undergoing treatment (e. g. low dosage, lack of active chemotherapeutic agent activity, absence of ALP concentrations, and elevated levels of alkaloids).Although some of the clinical findings derived from the above-mentioned data are derived directly from the use of medicinal products, the results of the OTERM protocol are not available (see section 200B of the Codex 100M), and therefore the conclusions of the MEDT study are limited to the following:",

The estimated cost of the new therapy and the comparison of their costs and effects with those of the existing treatment with respect to the maximum health benefits of the patient's response to the new chemotherapy is calculated on the basis of the cost-benefit ratio of the individual treatment (NDOC, SOBT, SOD-TERM, NDOC) and the corresponding monthly cost of treatment (SOBT+) for the individual patient. In interpreting the above findings, account should be taken of the limitations of the clinical analysis, which are also reflected in the estimates of the economic analysis. Whether the circumstances referred to in Article 13 (3) of the Act of 12 May 2011 on the reimbursement of medicines, foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses and medical devices (OJ L 255, 22.5.2022) are present in the financial analysis of the project will also have to be taken into account in the evaluation of the impact of the new technologies on the cost-effectiveness of healthcare provision and the impact on the financial prospects of the implementation of this new technology. In addition to the above, it is necessary to take into account the financial implications of these new technologies for the provision of public health care. (ZNF, Art. 13), the decision on the financing of the programme will be based on an assessment of the potential impact of new technology on the costs of health care provision, and not on the effects of the use of such technologies on public health. The limited reliability is also affected by the limitations of the clinical and economic analysis. Comments on the proposed risk-sharing instrument The proposed solution should be considered insufficient to mitigate the risks associated with the potential financing of the evaluated drug technology.",
