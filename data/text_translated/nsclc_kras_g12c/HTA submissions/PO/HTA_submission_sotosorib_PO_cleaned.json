Currently, there is no treatment aimed at KRAS G12C mutation and patients receive treatment in the B.6. The clinical and safety assessment of the proposed technology is based on direct comparison with docetaxel (DOC) and test results for comparison with nintedinib in combination with docetaxel (NIN+DOC) and with dual-drug platinum-based chemotherapy (P-CTH).",

      "text": "Lung cancer (code C34 according to ICD-10) is defined as a group of cancers located in bronchi (respiratory tract) and pulmonary pulp. Typical symptoms include a reduction in respiratory function or shortness of breath, chest pain, haemoptysis or frequent pneumonia. Primary lung cancer is a cancer derived from epithelial cells. The most common are 4 types of histology: • glandular cancer (45% - increase in incidence in the last period); • squamous cell carcinoma (30%); • small cell carcinoma (15%); • large cell carcinoma (10%). Small cell lung cancer (DRP) differs from other histological types in terms of biological and clinical characteristics (high proliferation rate, short doubling time of tumour mass, unique tendency to early metastasis formation, chemotherapy and relative radial sensitivity). This is a justification for the practice of division into DRP and non-small cell lung cancer (NDRP). NDRP). NDRP differs from other types of histology, and is poorly developed and is characterized by other types of histology.",

      "text": "Sotorasib is a selective inhibitor of KRAS G12C (an oncogenist of rat sarcoma Kirsten) which covalently and irreversibly binds to specific cysteine KRAS G12C. Inactivation of KRAS G12C by sotorasib blocks the signaling and survival of cancer cells, inhibits cell growth and induces selective apoptosis in tumours containing KRAS G12C mutation, an oncogenesis stimulating factor. According to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) Lumykras alone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NDRP) with KRAS G12C mutation, who have experienced disease progression after at least one previous line of application. The indication suggested is included in the registration indication. The assessment of efficacy (clinical and practical) and safety This assessment is based on the collection of data on health consequences (effectiveness and safety) resulting from the use of a new treatment in a given health problem and other treatments, which at any time are financed by this health assessment at any given time is necessary.",

      "text": "The economic evaluation, including the estimate of the costs to the health effects obtained The economic evaluation consists in estimating and comparing the costs and health effects that can be associated with the use of new therapies in a single patient instead of already refunded therapies. The cost of therapy is estimated in the currency of our country and the health effects are most frequently expressed in the years of life (LYG, life years guaranteed) or in the years of life in full health (QALY, quality adjusted life years) as a result of the treatment. The summary of the values and effects associated with the use of the new therapy and the comparison of them with the costs and effects of the therapies already refunded allows to obtain an answer to the question whether the health effect obtained in a single patient through the new therapy entails a higher cost compared to the treatment already refunded. The results of the cost-health effect ratio compare with the so-called profitability threshold, i.e. the result that indicates that, when the resource of our country (expressed in GDP) the maximum cost of the new therapy, which is cost of the new therapy, which the results obtained compared with the so called profitability threshold, i.",

One expert pointed out that the decision not to include other cancers in the patient's drug programme due to the co-existence of other cancers should be a doctor's. The record of exclusion of other cancers is one of the eligibility criteria for the drug programme in question. Discussion of the solutions proposed in the rationalization analysis The purpose of the rationalization analysis is to identify a mechanism whose introduction will result in the release of public funds corresponding to at least an increase in costs resulting from a positive decision on the refund of the proposed medical technology. A rationalization analysis is presented if the analysis of the impact on the budget of the entity obliged to finance public benefits shows an increase in the cost of the refund. In the submitted rationalization analysis, the applicant proposed solution was to discuss the recommendations made in other countries with regard to the assessed technology 3 clinical recommendations relating to the proposed indication issued by: • The Polish Society for Clinical Oncology (PTOK 2022); •",
