Lumykras (sotorasib) is included since August 2022 in the medicinal products benefits with limited subsidies in monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS G12C mutation, in progression after at least one previous line of systemic treatment. At the time of the decision there were no results from direct comparative studies between sotorasib and relevant comparators in the current patient population. The company chose to compare the relative effect between sotorasib (data from study CodeBreaK 100) and docetaxel (data from study SELECT-1) in a matched adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). The indirect comparison showed a longer progression-free survival (PF) and docetaxel (data from study SELECT-1).",

      "text": "The dental and pharmaceutical benefit agency (TLV) decides that Lumykras should remain in the drug benefit but with a change in the benefit limit at the above mentioned price for the following reasons: • After application from the company (dnr 1254/2024), TLV has decided to reduce the price of Lumykras. The new determined price of SEK 48 200 (AUP) will enter into force on 1 June • The costs of using Lumykras based on the reduced price of SEK 48 200 (AUP) will not be considered reasonable in relation to the benefit provided by the new study for patients who are subject to the current benefit limit compared to docetaxel. • The costs of using Lumykras based on the reduced price of SEK 48 200 (AUP) are considered reasonable in relation to the benefits of treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS G12C mutation, who have progressed after at least one previous line of systemic treatment and who have been treated with docetaxel or who are not medically suitable for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS G12C mutation, who have progressed after at least one previous line of systemic treatment and who have been treated with docetaxel or who are not medically suitable",

Sotorasib as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS G12C mutation at least after a previous line of systemic therapy. Sotorasib is a KRAS G12C inhibitor that binds to KRAS G12C's unique cysteine, which locks the protein into an inactive state. Sotorasib's inactivation of KRAS G12C blocks signaling and survival of tumour cells, inhibits cell growth and promotes cell death in tumours with KRAS G12C. The recommended dose is 960 mg sotorasib once daily via the mouth (oral). Advanced non-small cell lung cancer is a condition with very high severity TLV has previously been assessed (dnr 141/2022) that the severity of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS G12C mutation is very high. TLV does not find justification from this assessment.",

The appeal must be in writing and submitted to the Administrative Court, but sent to the TLV who forwards the appeal to the Administrative Court. TLV must have received the appeal within three weeks of the date on which the complainant received the decision, otherwise the appeal cannot be examined. The appeal must state which decision is being appealed and how the decision is to be amended. If TLV amends the decision appealed, the new decision will also be submitted to the Administrative Court. The appeal also includes the new decision.",
