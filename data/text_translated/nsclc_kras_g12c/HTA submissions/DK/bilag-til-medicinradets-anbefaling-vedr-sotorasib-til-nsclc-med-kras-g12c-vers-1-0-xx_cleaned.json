We want to highlight the significant innovation Sotorasib brings to patients with incurable non-small cell lung cancer with relapse after prior treatment. An innovation recognised by EMA, who awarded Sotorasib a conditional marketing authorisation due to the significant unmet need addressed by Sotorasib. We are therefore generally satisfied that the studies used reflect Danish clinical practice and that the methods used allow for a health economic evaluation. However, there are issues in this assessment report that Amgen wants to use the opportunity to comment on:",

This is despite the fact that comparative tables of these were prepared and attached to the application material and that it is possible to include them in the health economic model. In this particular case it is difficult to assess whether adverse events are caused by Sotorasib in Codebreak 100, or whether they are caused by previous treatment lines, which is also commented on in the report. It could have been further elucidated if adverse reactions had also been considered. Sotorasib causes fewer adverse effects of grade 3+ in Codebreak 100 (20.6%) compared to Docetaxel in SELECT-1 (30%) despite the fact that patients in Codebreak 100 were on active treatment for more than twice as long as in SELECT-1, had received several previous treatment lines, and patients in SELECT-1 have better performance scores than those in Codebreak 100.",
