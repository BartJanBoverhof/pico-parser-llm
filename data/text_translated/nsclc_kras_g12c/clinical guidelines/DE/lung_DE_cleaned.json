In accordance with the incidence, the mortality rates in Germany are also higher than in Switzerland and Austria (see Table 5). Table 9: Age-standardised death rates by gender in international comparison, ICD-10 C33 – C34, 2017 – 2018 (age Europe standard) Age-death rate in Germany 2017-2018 Women, Switzerland 19,0 33.3 Austria 21,2 40,1 Germany 22,1 43,4 Source: Centre for Cancer Register Data in Robert Koch Institute 3 Trend d Trend The incidence rate in the United Kingdom reached its peak in the late 1980s. Since then, the prevalence rate has declined, whereas the incidence among women continues to increase (source: report on cancer in Germany, 2016 is similar to that in the other countries. Largely, the higher prevalence of smoking in people with low socio-economic status contributes to their higher lung cancer risk. In addition, however, there is often an unfavorable constellation of interacting determinants such as nutrition and exposure to carcinogens in the environment [9] or in the workplace, whose influence is difficult to quantify [10]. On a regional level in Germany, the incidence of lung cancer is only increased in men in areas with low socioeconomic status [4]. In women, small-scale data do not show a significant relationship between regional socioeconomic status and lung cancer. One explanation would be that socio- economic differences in smoking behaviour in women have only developed later, towards the end of the 20th century [4]. Ultimately, socio-professional status correlates with survival after diagnosis. Individual income is inversely associated with letality [6]. A low regional socio-political status is also associated with a lower 5-year survival rate in Germany [11], [12]. In international comparison, a opposite relationship is observed: New disease and mortality rates are associated with higher mortality in countries with higher life expectancy, see gross population index.",

It was particularly high in large cities and in industrial regions in the past, which led to the assumption that air pollution was responsible for this. The more detailed study of the causes revealed that this was primarily due to the regionally stronger smoking and the more frequent occupational exposure to cancer in Austria, and that air contamination was probably only a minor contribution to Germany [14], [15] Survival time The relative annual survival rate of males with cancer in 2017 is also reported in Germany for example in Germany.

      "text": "The majority of the population in the Community has been affected by the increase in the number of hours of work, and the proportion of hours worked in the Member States has been reduced by the rise in the percentage of hours per week. The proportion of days worked in each Member State has increased by about 20 hours per day. The percentage of days spent in the European Community has risen by over 50 hours per month. The average number of days working in the EU has fallen by more than 40 hours per hour per week, the average rate of hours working in a Member State of the European Union has fallen from 1 % to 1 % per week in the United Kingdom. The figure for hours of working in that Member State is as high as the figure for the United States. In the case of men, there was a higher risk of smoking than in the case for women. In a European study [21], a 24-fold higher risk for current cigarette smokers was found for men than for life-long non-smokers. Ex-smokers had a 7.5-fold greater risk for women, respectively in the cases of lung cancer. The incidence of malnutrition is also associated with lung cancer. The incidence for a link between lung cancer and passive smoking in childhood is, however, less consistent than in adulthood [25], [27]. A similar picture provides meta-analysis of passive smoking at work. In women exposed to passive smoking on the workplace, the risk of lung cancer is increased by about 19%, but in men it is not significant by 12%, but here the sample size was relatively small [25 ]. A meta-analyse on the exposure-effect relationship between lung and passive smoke at work reported in 1998 as human cancer in persons who spent many years in heavily smoked workplaces, there is a good data basis for the assumption that the lung cancer risk in a long-term, regularly doubling the total exposure to non-working places. The main contribution to the natural radiation exposure of the population is due to the inhalation of the radioactive radon, in particular in geological regions of Germany such as the Bavarian Forest and the Erzgebirge. The concentration in the outdoor air is significantly lower by the passage of the radongases from the rock. The doses for other organs and tissues are low. A European pooling study has shown that a linear exposure-effect relationship can be assumed in Germany. Pro 100 Bq/m3 corrected radon exposure can be expected to increase the relative risk by 16 %. This data situation makes interventions to reduce radon exposures necessary [36]. In Germany the average radon concentration in dwellings is 49 Bq /m3 and the average concentration in free 9 B/m4 passed from B2 to B4. For example, in the field of radiological radiation exposure [39], medical radiation exposure and, above all, X-ray diagnostics make the highest contribution to the civilizing radiation exposure of the population. In the health sector, until the 1960s, partly outdated X-Ray equipment was used, which could also lead to a significant human exposure. One of the most important factors in the study of lung cancer in the United States was the relative risk of PM2.5. It increased by 14 % in relation to a change of 10 μg/m3 PM2.5 The International Cancer Research Agency (IARC, International Agency for Research on Cancer) of the World Health Organization (IMRC) has estimated that in 2013 the exposure to fine dust and air pollutants to the detected human cancer has increased by more than 50 000 in the case of over-diagnosis of the disease. In addition, the number of cases reported in the last two years was very high. In addition to the number and number of deaths in the first two years of the same year, there was an increase in the number (in the last three years) of the population. In the second half of the year there was a rise in the proportion of deaths from the same day to the same month of the previous year. In most studies only the occupational name and duration of the activity at the workplace were available. Therefore, a quantification of the lung cancer risk (Braunasbest) and Krokydolite (Blauasbest). Asbestos has a fibrogenous and locally asbestos-related activity. The cumulative exposure of asbestos fibre dust is calculated in fibre years, one fibre year corresponds to an eight-hour working-day effect over a year of 1 million asbestos fibres per m3 [53]. Hazard sources were mainly the asbestos textile industry (manufacturing of yarns, fabrics, ropes), the asbestos cement industry (production of plates, tubes, fittings), the construction industry (processing of asbestos cement products, asbestos-containing putty, spatula compounds, fire protection materials), the chemical industry (asbestos use as filler for paints and sealants, synthetic resin pressing compounds, thermoplastics, rubber tyres), the insulation industry (heat, sound and fire protection), the asbestos paper industry (Asbestos papers and cardboard) and the friction coating industry (best brake and clutch coverings) [53 ].

In contrast, metallized nickel is considered to be ‘possibly carcinogenic' (Group 2B). The anti-cancer effect of the anti-caking activity has been attributed to the water-soluble nickel compounds. The MAK commission classified metal nickel and nickel in water-insoluble compounds – in the form of breathable dusts – as carcinogenic in humans. Since 2001 the water soluble compounds in the shape of aerosols have also included [60]. Dichlordimethylether, monochlorodimethyl ether Both substances are used in the chemical industry as intermediate products for the synthesis of organic substances and in the preparation of ion-exchange resins. The incidence of lung carcinoma in men who were exposed to dichlorodiphenyl ether or monochlorodiophenyl ethers can be increased by up to 8 % in the factor [61]. In the case of the epidemiological clarification of a possible dose-effect relationship, it is essential to know which exposures usually occur during hard metal processing. In particular, it may be a source of danger if free crystalline silica is contained in it, e.g. talc: ore (including uranium ore) and coal miners, tunnel builders, cast cleaners, sandblasters, furnace masons, moulders in the metal industry, persons employed in stone extraction, processing or processing or in coarse and fine ceramic plants, as well as in dental laboratories 2) silicon dioxide: quartz, cristobalite and tridymite.

In the event of an increase in the incidence of cancer (e.g. the incidence incidence rate of cancer in the first 12 months of the year), the incidence level of the incidence rates of cancer is reduced by 44%. In this case, the prevalence rate for the incidence frequency of cancer of the previous 12 months has been increased by 64%. The incidence rate for cancer of smoking in the second 12 months after the end of the month was increased by 57%. There was a significant increase in the number of patients who had been diagnosed with diabetes over a period of one week, an increase in frequency of the disease, a decrease in the frequency of surgery, a reduction in the duration of the treatment (e. g., the incidence rate of overdose, an increased incidence rate) in the first week of treatment (i.e. the incidence level of epidemiology, an decrease in incidence rate, an improvement in the incidence of pneumonia). As explained in chapter \"Epidemiology\", passive smoking is now recognised as an important risk factor for lung cancer. In a meta-analysis [69], passive smoking in the workplace is associated with a 22% increase in risk for lung carcinoma. According to calculations by the German Cancer Research Center, lung cartinoma patients with non-smokers are often motivated to stop smoking [73]. In spite of this, approximately 50% of the patients with newly diagnosed lung carboom is also able to support successful patients. There was no difference between current and former smokers [68] in another retrospective longitudinal study in patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC. A significant difference in survival was not described. These studies countered a series of studies that showed an independent risk factor for mortality in smokestop patients. In a 2 taba akraucchen and lung carcinoma 65 retrospective longitudinal examination in 1155 patients with NSClc, the current smoke status was associated with age, socio-economic data and alcohol consumption is an independent hazard factor for mortality [79]. In the event of an accident at work, the opinion of the Management Board shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. In line with the scientific findings on the carcinogenic effects of agents, the MRI is regularly evaluated and classified by various organisations (e.g. DFG and IARC) according to the MMR. The determination of health-related limit values for carcinogenic substances is not possible, since the findings to date on the patho-mechanisms of carcinogenesis in the low dose range also require at least a linear dose-response relationship to be assumed, so that the risk with decreasing exposure level is reduced, then epidemiologically no longer detectable, but cannot be completely excluded. The limit values published so far concerning carcinogenic agents therefore refer to the state of technical possibilities of minimisation. Likewise, the employer's obligation to assess the workplaces regarding their hazards arises from the Hazards Regulation. For activities involving carcinogenic substances, the following requirements are made: • There is a need for substitution of the substance by a less dangerous approach to the prevention of occupational diseases. In the case of asbestos (confirmation of lung carcinogenicity in 1933, continuous ban on asbestos in Germany in 1993, EU-wide ban in 2005), the success of these late-introduced prevention measures will only be demonstrated by a steady decrease in the number of lung carcinomas due to the long latency periods of about 30 years from around 2020. A decrease in cases recognised as occupational disease could already be detected in 2015 (2013: 793; 2014: 832; 2015: 771) (source: Secondary prevention in occupational medicine is regulated for cancer diseases, especially by lifelong follow-up (after exposure) occupational medical examinations. These are organised by the ZeBWis (Central Care Unit Wismut) for workers working in the uranium mining industry, through which ZAs (Central Monitoring Centre for Dust Hazardous Workers) for asbestos exposure exposure levels and by ODIN (Organisation Service for Post-exit Investigations) for all other cancer-related agents. 4.4 Radiation u Recommendation A level of exposure to radiation exposure to Eviden-based radiation exposure levels of the exposure to dust exposure to exposure to asbestos must be reduced in 2010.",

This additional cancer risk, as well as the genetic risk generated by ionising radiation, is referred to as stochastic radiation effect. In line with the current state of knowledge [91], one continues to assume that the cancer risk is linear, ohn lower threshold dose, with the dose increasing (so-called linear-non-threshold hypothesis, the epidemiological studies have proven that the lung is one of the relatively highly radiation sensitive organs. A detailed description of the correlations can be found in the chapter \"Epidemiology\". For example, in the case of X-ray radiation, for example, if a doctor withdraws one step from the patient to be examined (from about 30 cm to 1 m), the dose is already reduced by the factor 10. • Shielding should be used. For X-Ray radiation, e.g. a lead apron may reduce the dose depending on the radiation quality between a factor 10 and 100. Constructional and technical radiation protection measures are to be planned. The radiation risk is strongly dependent on the age of exposure. For this reason, special protection measures apply to the unborn child. Even for children and adolescents, the highest standards of protection are allowed today.",

There were no decreases in vitamin D11, but there was a decrease in vitamin C11 and the incidences of vitamin E11 were not increased. There was no reduction in vitamin Β12 and there were also no increases for vitamin B12. Similar to this type of vegetable, the risk of lung cancer was lower when increased intake or increased urine levels of isothiozyanates [118], [119],[120]. Likewise, there is sufficient evidence that flavonoids, especially quercetin, can lead to a similar reduction in lung cancer rate [121], (122), [123] (Evidenzg 3a). flavons occur in apples, celery, onions, tea leaves, citrus fruits, berries and soya [122]. Garlic, however, was not protective against lung cancer [124]. In this respect, it can be assumed that organic sulfur, which sow in high concentrations in onions but also garlic, is not responsible for the protective effect [122-]. High alcohol consumption is associated with an increased lung cancer risk [125] as well as a decreased body mass index [110],.[126] In alcohol consumption, beer seems to have a more negative influence, whereas wine consumption is more likely to be associated with a reduction of lung risk.",

This assessment was also reflected in the restrained ‘potency recommendation' on the CT screening for the lung carcinoma published in the 2018 (last) version of this guideline. Both the large Dutch-Belgian NELSON study and the significantly smaller German LUSI study as well as the 10-year post-evaluation of the Italian MILD study were not calculated with 8.

In October 2020, the first decisive step was to present the evidence assessment carried out on behalf of the G-BA by the Institute for Quality and Economicality in Health Care (IQWIG). In its final report, the IQWig stated that the low-dose CT screening was not beneficial to any screening and therefore that for (former) strong smokers the benefits of low-canoe CT lung cancer screening outweighed the damage [149].

In case of a systematic literature study, 2 systematic overviews of the sensitivity of thoracic cancer ([220]) as well as the diagnostic accuracy of thorsynthesis ([221]) and a randomized controlled study (RCT) for the feasibility of a timely X-ray examination of the thorax organs ([222]) were identified. Both systematic survey work was carried out with evidence level 2a and RCT with evidence levels 1b. For the detection of a symptomatic lung cancer, a sensitivity of the 77-80% was reported in the literature ([20]). For example, in the case of mid-diagnosis of the mid-thirty dose, a mid-stirty portion of the epidemiology of the hypothyroidism is considered to be very common. In the case with mid-to- mid-tirty phase, a high-thybride dose of the antithyrrhythmia is reported.

One of the more important things to do in today's industry is to find out more about the benefit of the PET/CT in the case of low-dose breast cancer. In order to get more information about the use of this product, it is necessary to check the usage of the device in order to determine whether it is possible to increase the benefit to the patient in the event of a disease. The more important thing to do is to get out of the way with the benefit from the insulin level 1a or 2a. Both metaanalyses result in different results. An analysis from the year 2016 with 7 included studies (in total 408 patients) found hardly any evidence of the benefits of the PE/CT during the treatment of small-dose symptoms of the lung. In order to clarify the question of an existing mediastinalinfiltration, the epidemiology of the epididymological disease (diagnosis of epithymia and epithromymology of epithelial disease) was found to be very dynamic. In addition, the diagnosis of epididmology was not performed in a systematic literature study. 6.3 Bildg EK g and diagnosis assurance 94 Consensus-based recommendation tested 2024 In a proven well differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of the lung, somatostatin receptors can be used to clarify treatment options in order to present the primary tumor and its colonizations scintigraphically or by means of PET. Several studies have documented the results of neuroenocrine differentiated tumours of the lungs.[237]; this characteristic is suitable to expect with radioactive somatostatic receptors of low incidence. For example, in the case of an E-diagnosis, it is not possible to determine the number of patients who have been diagnosed with E-dimensions, i.e., the proportion of patients receiving E-Dimensive Diagnosis (e.g., E-Diagnosis of E-D2 or E-Methods of Ethythrombin, e-dialysis of E.D.2 and E-I.D2). This may be a test-thoracotomy for the patient. The situation in the tumour relationship to the thorax wall can be compared with a sensitivity of 38-87% and a specificity of 40-90% [255]. As the underlying studies mainly originate from the 80s and 90s, the result is a sensitive diagnosis of e-distinctation by means of radiological incision methods (40 %). A more reliable diagnosis of a bone invasion is necessary for the setting, at least for the corresponding diagnosis of the pleura. Nevertheless, enlarged lymph nodes are to be mentioned in the findings reports and their localization according to UICC (Union internationale contre le cancer) in order to be able to clarify them concretely in further staging. In conjunction with an FDG-PET, the lymph node size is a helpful parameter: In a metaanalysis, only a 5% probability was found in lymph node <10 mm and negative FDG PET, in >15 mm lymph node a 21% probability of a false negative N2 rating ([260]). This means that small lymph node and normal PET do not have to be mediastinoscopy, but it has to be carried out in large lymph node despite negative PET.

In addition, the number of patients who have been diagnosed with epithyroid disease may not be included in the list of diseases listed above. [315] For example, the average number of patients who had been diagnosed with a disease in the first half of the year was not included in the sample. [318] The mean number of cases for the first two months of the clinical trial were not included. [312] The average number for the second half of this clinical trial was increased from 1 to 2 years. [322] In the clinical application of the models it is important to understand the population from which the respective model was derived. The Mayo-Clinic model was originally developed in less of a cohort of one year. In the case of a single dose, the first dose of 1 dose of 2 dose of 3 dose of 4 dose of 6 dose of 12 dose of 8 dose of 24 dose of 10 dose of 30 dose of 20 dose of 25 dose of 14 dose of 18 dose of 7 dose of 50 dose of 5 dose of 100 mg of 1 mg of 2 mg of 3 mg of 4 mg of 10 mg of 6 mg of 8 mg of 5 mg of 9 mg of 12 mg of 7 mg of 11 mg of 14 mg of 13 mg of 16 mg of 17 mg of 15 mg of 24 mg of 25 mg of 30 mg of 20 mg of 19 mg of 100 ml of 1 ml of 10 ml of 2 ml of 12 ml of 3 ml of 6 ml of 4 ml of 8 ml of 14 ml of 30 ml of 20 ml of 24 ml of 100 g of 10 kg of 10 g of 1 g of 100 mm of 10 μ m of 1 kg of 12 g of 2 g of 12 mm of 1 vial of 12 times more than 1 ml more than 2 ml in 10 ml. In one of the clinical trials, the incidence rate was 4.1% in both population and non-conformity. In the case of malnutrition, it is necessary to determine the incidence of malnitrition. In the event of malnarithms, the incidence rate of malinarithmus should be reduced. In this case the incidence level of a malnibrithism is increased. The incidence of malignancies is increased by 1 mm. The incidence rate of malnutrition is reduced by 1 %. The prevalence rate of a malnutricity is increased with 1 % of the incidence rate. The proportion of malnitrition in the incidence of an epidemiology is decreased by 2 %. In the case of malnity, the incidence frequency of malinsurance has been increased by 3 %.The incidence rate for malinduration has been reduced by 3 percentage points. The average incidence rate has been decreased by 1 percentage points and the incidence incidence rate by 1 percent. [331] For example, in case of malignancies, there is no pre-examination of the patient's clinical history. In the case of a patient' s clinical history, the clinical history of the disease can be confirmed. In this case, a pre-disposition of the clinical diagnosis can be described only as a clinical history (e.g., the history of an epidemiology of the epidiology of a epididymological history) or as an epididial history of a pro-diagnosis of the pre-determinative history of epidipology, the epididactic history of pre-dialogy, the diagnosis of epididical history, etc.). In the absence of prior diagnosis of the pro-disaception of epiDemiology (emission of epithymology), the clinical study can be given as an indication of the maligniology. A minimal difference between SCLC and NSCLC exists in that the SCLC does not require a subdivision of the stage IV in IVA and IVB for the metastatic stage [336]. TNM classification The clinical classification of the tumours by their spread locally, regionally and remotely allows a pragmatic handling of the diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. The comparison of results of clinical studies and the evaluation of registers is only possible by the classification of tumors. Thus, the classifications of the tumors according to their spread rate are a central instrument in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancers. In this respect, the TNMS classification is only an important but indispensable building block for the care of patients with lung cancer. The 8th edition of the TNOM classification has not been well investigated by the International Association for the Study of TNCer on the basis of the Circulation of the year 2010 and is always available from the list of diseases.

In this classification, the findings detected prior to treatment are supplemented or modified by findings obtained during surgical intervention and through pathological examination. The pathological assessment of the primary tumor (pT) requires a resection of the primal tumor or biopsies that are adequate for the determination of the highest pT category. An excisions of a lymph node (pN) requires the removal of lymph nodes to an extent that is not sufficient to determine the absence of regional lymph node metases (p N0) and fully corresponds to that. • The use of a metastasis in each lymph node is not classified as remote metastases. 2cm, more of an extension of the tumor, more than 1cm, less of a tumor, less than 1 cm, more or less of an increase in the number of tumors, more then 1 cm of the population, less or less than 2 cm of population, greater than 1 ms of population or more of a population, more often than 1 ct of population (e.g. 2 ct) of population and less than 3 cts of the total population, not more than 2 cc of population. • The T-classification description of primary tumour cannot be assessed or the detection of malignant cells in the sputum or in the case of bronchial flushing, but the tumor is not visible in the most common frequency or bronchoscopy.",

In the case of malignancies, it is necessary to take into account the epithelial epithelium and the epitome of the epistemological epithesis. In particular, the epithyroid epithetology of the adenocarcinoma (e.g. the epitemology of epithema of epistema, the pre-examination of epitymology and epitheme of epitema).

It should be noted that the number of patients who have been treated with the disease has increased significantly in recent years. The opinion of the Committee of the Regions is of the opinion that the provisions of the directive should be amended as follows: the opinion ofthe Committee ofthe Regions should be delivered on the occasion of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities; the opinion should be given on the proposal for a Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes (COM(2003) 426 final); the opinion is drawn up on the basis of the paper produced by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection; and the opinion has been drawn up in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 2 of the Directive of the Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the harmonization of social security schemes for employed persons and their families moving within the Community.

In particular, in the case of cancerous malignancies, it is recommended to give a summary of the results obtained. (TNM classification, 8th edition, [344]): • R0: no residual tumour • R1: microscopic residual tumor • R2: macroscopic residual cancer • RX: presence of residual tumor cannot be assessed. However, in this respect there is no general consensus as \"some assume that R classification can only be applied in relation to the primary tumor and its local or regional spread. Others have wider application of R classification and remote metastases\" (TM classification). [357] Exclusion of the tumor epithelial cancers and of the disease of the population of the tumour. In the case of the malignancies of the cancer, the incidence rate of the dose of the other tumours is determined by the frequency of the patient's disease. However, there is only insufficient data on the criteria to be taken into account [[346]. For other lung tumours, the degree of differentiation is based on histological typing (typical carcinoids, atypical carcinoids, large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, small cell carcinoma) is considered to be poor.

The recommendations were modified with regard to the specific characteristics of this patient group. In the context of the revision of the S3, guideline Pulmonary Carcinoma, in particular, it was examined which recommendations of the s3 guideline on palliative medicine [441 ] apply to the patient-centred communication with a lung carcinoma disease. In the case of the patient, it is not possible for the patient to respond to the patient's concerns. The fact that the patient had received more information about the disease was confirmed by the opinion of the patient. If the information had been returned to them, the patient should be told how to get out of here. The information had to be kept in mind: the patient was told that it had not received any information from him or her. The opinion had been given to the patient in response to the opinion given by the patient(s) who had received the opinion from the patient (be told that the opinion had not been given by him or herself). The opinion was of the opinion that the patients had received an opinion from one of the above groups and that they had not had received any further information from the doctor (e.g. the opinion was given to them. the information contained in the opinion (example number of the patients).

Conssensus based Recommendation 7.3 EK EK ziale A Enlightenment Situations 158 Consensual based Recommendation is to be examined in a step-by-step manner with regular reassurance, whether and to what extent the patient has understood it. Consensus-based Recommendation is intended to encourage the patient to ask questions. Conszens based Recommendation 2024 Family members should be perceived and appreciated in their role as supporters and co-affected. They should be asked about their needs and encouraged, if necessary, to accept support offers. Consent background As soon as the diagnosis of a lung carcinoma is secured, the patient should be informed by the treating physician. The doctor should be aware of whether the partner, relatives or third parties should be involved in the discussion. However, there is enough to support for the patient's participation in the treatment process. It is necessary to inform the patient of the following: [4] the patient's response, 4] the person's opinion, 4) the patient 's response and 4' the response to the response. In addition to the information given to the patient, the following information should be given: (e.g. in the case of a patient's disease) The following information is given: [e. g. in case of an illness] The information given by the patient must be given in the form of an opinion given to him or her. (e) The information provided by the doctor should be provided in the course of the treatment. (f) The answer to the question is that the patient is not aware of his or her illness and that he or she is not in a position to take part in the treatment of the patient. (b) The question whether the patient should be informed of his/her illness. (c) The questions are addressed to the doctor. (d) The discussion content in a potentially curative treatment situation differs from those in a palliative disease situation. (see chapter 8.2.1). In the event of an illness, the patient should be informed of the expected outcome of the disease. In the case of a disease, the person concerned should be given the opportunity to take part in the planning of the patient's treatment. Consensus background \"The forward-looking care planning\" describes a systematic, interprofessionally accompanied communication and implementation process between patients, relatives and relevant individuals involved in the treatment of the patient. The process includes the best possible awareness-raising, reflection, documentation and, if necessary, clinical implementation of the treatment preferences of patients with regard to future hypothetical clinical scenarios. \" [450] \"The goal of forward-sighted care planning is the best way to implement the individual preferences of the affected patient and his/her relatives. These preferences relate not only to the superior therapy goal (life extension and/or quality of life in a palliative situation) and the therapeutic decisions based on it (treatment of cancer, emergencies and crises), but also to preferences and priorities in the remaining lifetime, e.g. regarding life organization, place of life, location of death or care arrangement. \"The conversational accompaniment to the forward-thinking care planning should be offered early in the course of and repeatedly in the event of significant changes in feeling and prognosis.\" [441] In the discussions on forward-seeking care planning, the patient's population should be included in an understanding of the provision of the previous person as well, as well as well. It is important to thank the people who have contributed to the treatment of patients with an unhealable cancer. The following are some of the following: • in the event of an accident, the dose should be reduced by the amount of the dose. • in case of an emergency, the amount should be increased by the dose of the patient. • In the event that the dose is increased by one dose, the dosage should be adjusted accordingly. • The dose should not be increased, the frequency of the therapy should be changed. • There should be an increase in the frequency and frequency of therapy. • Outcomes should be used for the assessment of comorbidity/activity in daily life. In addition, in view of the importance of 2 patients receiving treatment, there was an improvement in the duration of the treatment (e.g. the period of treatment) of the patient receiving treatment (i.e. the duration and duration of treatment). As a side effect, it was noted that the early inclusion of palliative structures reduced costs For the recommendation of an early integration of pallitative care, the study situation for metastatic lung cancer is exemplary, as 40% of all patients with lung carcinoma already have remote metastases at the time of diagnosis. The symptom load is high and often diagnostic. The median survival time of the overall group is also only –1222--- 18 months for palliatory chemo and radiation therapy. Compared to a 5-year period (2007 to 2009), the overall survival rates for NCLC have slightly increased (men: +0.8%, women: +0.6%) [540] [541]. Thus, maintaining or improving the quality of life constitutes an essential therapy/intervention goal. The recognition of the benefit of an earlier integrative concept between oncological standard therapy and palliativ treatment has already led to 8.2 concept of early integration in palliamental care for patients oncological surgery.",

The multidimensionality of the patient's response can be assessed by a multiprofessional approach of palliative co-care. The consultation should take place as an independent appointment with defined conditions. The study situation suggests that there must be defined criteria that trigger early palliatory co-treatment. Symptoms and burdens are mainly identified and treated when patients are actively, routinely and structured [550]. From the experience that general recommendations are not sufficient, were developed by Gärtner et al diagnostic criteria for the optimal timing of pallliative interventions for various malignancies [551], [552]. In lung carcinoma patients the following criteria were defined in this working group: any new disease in the metastatic stage and any inoperable recurrence. Here, following the introduction of the defined trigger criteria, positive indications for a successful previous integration of pallisative care were found to be common within months. The studies showed that there was a statistically significant effect on the quality of life and depression in patients with metastatic pulmonary carcinoma [500], [504] and [545]. Furthermore, in one study a significant reduction in unnecessary chemotherapy (60 days before the end of life) [533] and in two studies a significant improvement in survival time could be shown [504), [544]. An additional pillar of the integrated early palliative care week is the routine involvement of a palliativ physician or a medical palliator specialist in the tumor conferences. According to the requirements of the German Cancer Society, at least once per 8.2 concept of early integration of palliatory care week will be given an interdisciplinary tumor conference, in which the main treatment partners will participate regularly and in which all patients with first-manifestation or rezidiv of a lung carcinomas should be pretherapeutic. 11.65/16.00; SMD = NSCLC (stage 3-4) (%): 84 1.8; < .0001 6 weekly intervention: 60-minute telephone frequency sessions with a train 12.35/14.84; SMF = interventionist control Usual palliative care Bakitas, M. et Number of cases: N=161 Intervention(s): Mid-survival al., 2009 14/8,5 mo Setting: USA, 2 sites Advanced practice nurses [504] with palliativ care Overall survival Patient characteristics specialty training 30.4/26,1 mo : 62% male, age in induced 4 initial Means: 65 years, 98% medium follow up structures educational kaukasisch 10.7 mo and problemsolving married or living with sessions Bias risk: partner: 73% Manual for:1) problem incomplete lung: 34% exiting 2) In the case of clinical stage I patients with NSCLC, lobectomy is not possible due to comorbidities or pulmonary function restriction, anatomical segment resection or stereotactic radiation therapy should be offered. nce [555], [557],[559],",

In the case of an erythropoietin-resin, the resectional function of the erythema can not be compared with that of an Erythromycin, the emymycin is not included in the Emymies. However, the Resectional distance to the tumor should be greater than the tumor diameter. Hospitalle mortality after a limited resection is reported in a range of 0 to 6 percent. The 30-day Hospitalletality after lobectomy is reported with 3 percent in an area of 0 - 9 percent [561], [560] (Evidence Grade 3b). Cuffing resinctions have been introduced for the first time in order to obtain a Pneumonectomy in patients with a reduced lung function as much as possible with the Erymymymins. The mean mean mean survival time was significantly lower in patients with pneumonectomy, 4 times the mean survival rate after manschette resection (70 mo. vs. 50 mo.; p=0.02). In the second survey, however, the mean median survival time for patients with Pneumonektomy was significantly smaller than in patients who had manschete resections (70 m/s). In addition, the target volume definition requires imaging control of the respiratory excursion of the tumor by atemtriggered 4D computer tomography series in irradiation position. Detailed standards for target volume definitions, dose prescription and medical physical quality assurance in the high precision radiation therapy of the lung carcinoma are among others in guidelines or position papers of the specialist companies EORTC [591], DEGRO [562] and AAPM [566] are defined. One of the more pronounced symptoms of a tumor in a peripheral localization (3x 3 Gy or 5 Gy) was found to be of an excessive toxicity compared with 445 patients with an aggressively dosed SBRT. The overall positive response rate of a patient was not defined by the patient's clinical response rate as a percentage of the population. In patients with COPD GOLD III-IV in a systematic review compared with inclusion of an own series [579]. The 3 day mortality rate was 10 % (weighted) for the patients who were treated with SBRT, it was 0 %. Both modalities were able to achieve local control rates of ≥ 89% and a comparable 1-year or 3-year survival respectively. However, by means of propensity score matching, it could be shown that the long-term survival in patients treated with parenchyme-sparing surgery above which the patient with stereotactic radiation therapy was [590], the results of several retrospective studies comparing SBRI and limited resection are not clearly and apparently subject in their overall results to a pronounced selection bias [580], [581],[582], in these therapeutic border situations, beyond the recommendation of the tumor conference, to adequately integrate the patient into decision-making regarding the surgical Ig/testive stage.",

In the event of a disease, the proportion of the tumours in the population should be increased by 2 times. In this case the incidence level of the disease should be reduced by 2 days. In some cases, a reduction in the number of tumours may be considered as equivalent in relation to overall survival [607]. This was confirmed in a randomised multicenter study for two more than 2 cm in the IA1/2 stage. [337] The majority of patients have been diagnosed with epidemiology.The majority of the patients who have had epidemia have been treated with epididymology. [336] The percentage of patients who had had had epididmological disease in the last 30 days has been considered to be the majority of those who had received epidemic disease. [236] It can be divided into minor and serious consequences. A systematic survey [528], which summarizes 15 studies [529], [631],[632],.[634], (635], ...638], \"639],\" [641], (\"minimum 1 %, maximum 76%), [643], and a further 4 articles [597],] [599] and [600] show for open surgery in lung cancers an average of 3.5%.

(Evidence Level 2a) All the above-mentioned studies show a lower incidence of pain [611], a reduced incidence of relapses and a shorter hospital stay [612]. In the case of malnutrition, the number of patients who had been treated with SBRT was reduced by 84%. In the first half of the year, the incidence rate was increased by 86%. In this case, there was no increase in the proportion of patients treated with the SBRI, but in the second half of this year, there were no increases in the number and number of subjects treated with HBRI. In these cases, the overall incidence rate of these patients was higher than that of those treated with MBRI and the incidence rates were higher than those reported with HFRI. 58% of the lymph nodes were found to be significant. However, if there is no systematic incidence of lymphoma, then there is an incidence rate of lymphocyte (e.g. 1-fold) of the disease, the incidence rate is not increased by 1-thirty-thy-tharythmythmia, 2-thyroxythythymia and 4-thylthyma, 3-thhythyme, 4-hyme-thmyme, 5-thlyme, 6-thiesme, 8-thcyme, 7-thby-methymi, 5-1thymes, 5-2thymophos, 6-2thies, 6thymus, 5thmus, 4thmus. In addition, in the case of a 4th-level study, there was a 4rd-level relapse, but the 5th-grade relapse rate was found to be higher than the 2nd-degree relapse. In this chapter, the pancoast tumors are not included in 3 stadi ium I/ /II 182 and are listed separately in chapter 8.4. The systematic overview of the literature here only summarizes breast wall infiltration by lung carcinoma. Approximately 10th of the resectable, non-small cell lung carcinomas show a 12th-range relapse after the first-year resection. However, a later study did not show any difference in survival between patients with an en-bloc full-wall breast resection or a less aggressive treatment if complete resection is achieved [629] (evidence level 3b). Regarding the aggressiveness of the surgical procedure, all studies did not reveal a significant difference in letality (evident level 3B). The radicality of breast wall resection was a significant prognostic factor (evence level 3). The depth of chest wall infiltration could influence the prognosis, with a greater role playing here in the surgical technique, which should only allow extrapleural lyse in the case of pleurainvasion without ribinfiltation and require full wall reection in the event of deeper infiltration (evance level 3 B).

This was not associated with a statistically significant increase in mortality or morbidity in the first half of the year. The second prospectively randomized study was the one for the first six months of the course of surgery. In the second half of this year, only 60.9% (128/210) of patients received 3 cycles of induction therapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin. However, in the adjuvant arm, only 60.9% (128/ 210) received 3 courses of planned adjuvant therapy. The rate of surgery, the mortality rate and the rate of morbidities were identical in the three arms. No difference in survival was observed in the overall group with only 0.9.

In addition, patients who had been treated with Dneumonectomy in the first half of the year were treated with ADI in the second half of this year. In the second quarter of the previous year, the incidence of ODI in patients who were receiving ADI was reduced by ADI to 2 mg/day.

In this context, the majority of patients did not receive a full-time dose of 2 hours of treatment. In the event of a full time dose of 4 hours of therapy, the 2 days of treatment of 4 days of surgery was significantly more important than the 2 weeks of surgery. In addition, the total number of patients who had received 4 times more than 1 day of treatment was higher than 2 days. In this case, the average number of hours of restorative treatment was greater than 2 hours. In some cases, the number of days of resturative treatment is higher than 1 hour of treatment in the first half of the course of study.

On the one hand, the integration of immunotherapy into a trimodal concept with radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery [706], no results are available here. On the other hand, it can be discussed how far a neoadjvuante chemoimmun therapy could be used without radiation therapy, analogous to the procedure in the Checkmate-816 study, possibly also in the pancoast tumor. For important prospective studies on trimodal therapy in the Pancoasttumor, rates of complete pathological response of 28% and 29% were reported [697], [705]. In a recent systematic review of all studies on neoadjuvant immunotherapy or immunochemotherapy of the NSCLC (outside the pancosttumor), the pooled rate of total pathological emissions was 28% ([656]; see chapter 8.5.3.3), but the latter included stage groups I to III, i.e. lower stages.

He distinguished the microscopic infestation of a single lymph node level (mN2L1), the microscopy of several lymph node stations (m N2L2+), the preoperatively detected infestations of a one single lymph nodal station (cN2 L1) and the pre-operatively known incidence of multiple lymph node sites (c N2 L2+).

In some of these cases, the patient has had an adverse reaction (e.g., in some cases it has been reported that it has not been shown that there is an adverse effect on the patient's ability to respond to the disease). In some patients, the incidence of the disease has not increased significantly in some patients. In others, there is evidence that the incidence rate has been increased in some of the patients who had had had a disease. This effect was stronger in the presence of PD-L1 expression [671]. Based on these data, chemoradiotherapy is currently standard in inoperable stage III when PD- L1 is detected, followed by Durvalumab. In the operable stage, the inhibition of PD-1 or PD-l1 will probably also establish itself. The question of the best multimodal therapeutic procedure is usually to be clarified in the thorax oncological tumor board.

In the same case, the daily dose of Cisplatin in combination of cipsplatin and cispulin in combination (e.g. cisptan, cisplanoid, cipslatin, cispadin, ciptan, disptan and cispitone in combination). In this meta-analysis, a significant survival advantage can be demonstrated by the cisptin-based combination [803]. • Cisptan also affects G0 cells (outside of the cycle, not proliferating) in the treatment of these symptoms. We would not have been able to give up the majority of the patients on a single day, as well as some of the other patients on the same day.

Currently, subgroup analyses regarding the extent of mediastinal infestation have not been published. The data were presented at ESMO in autumn 2020 as a lecture [836] and in 2022 [839]. Although the study revealed a highly significant advantage or locoregional relapse freedom for the irradiated group (mediastinal relapse 25 vs. 46%), however, there were no major discussion points for this topic. However, the rate of non-tumour related mortality and the pulmonary toxicity were significantly increased after this study. The short interval for increased death by 2nd malignancies in the irradiation arm is indicated by the following examples: [E2D] [E4D], [E8D]. In case of established stage IIIA(N2) (detection of mediastinoscopy or transbronchial puncture of LK), a procedure with induction chemotherapy was tested and then the randomization of definitive surgery versus radiotherapy [695]. Patients were included before the era of PET-CT as inclusion examination. Induction chemotherapy consisted of the possibility to use 18 different chemotherapy protocols, both cisplatin-based combinations, carboplatin-based and platinum-free combinations were used. Essentially, non-resectable tumours were included. Due to the unfavourable downsizing and downsagging, in this study the pneumonectomy rate and the rate of incomplete resections were very high [694], [849].

In the second half of this study, the patients were then treated with an initial dose regimen (R1 or R2 resection congestion as a chemotherapy component) and then, in the second margin regimen, patients were treated with a simultaneous dose regimen of chemotherapy (albeit carboplatin and vindesine as a chemotherapy component). However, the patient population of the study included practically all patients with a median dose regimen. EBUS was not performed at this time. The patient recruitment was carried out between October 1995 and March 2003 by a multicentre regimen at German centers instead of bad outcomes. In this case, there were only a few cases of indigestion that had to be performed in the first phase of the therapy. In the second phase of recruiting, however, the patients had to take advantage of the procedure. In addition, in the second stage of the treatment, there was no need to use the epidemiology of the epididymology, but in the next phase, there had to have been an indigestive disease. In this phase, the epiDemiology has to be carried out in the last phase of surgery. In some cases, there is no evidence that the epidermis could be used as a predisposition for the surgery. The progression-free survival showed an advantage for the operation and a much criticized, post-hoc subgroup analysis as a matched-pair analysis for patients with lobectomy was able to provide a survival benefit for the procedure as a signal. In the last week of the study, one of the patients who had been treated with Influx II was treated with influx III. One of the subjects who had had been diagnosed with Intag2 treatment had been given with Infiltration III. The patient who had appeared as resectable had been randomised to the operation or to a definitive chemotherapy boost, which was carried out without pause. The late randomization should minimize drop outs before the start of the comparative therapy phases. The result on the survival endpoint shows overall comparable findings to the intergroup study with a 5-year survival of 34% (ITT) and well over 40% in both randomised arms. In the primary endpoints, there were no significant differences between the poor. A difference between Trimodal and Bimodal was that the operation resulted in a higher peritherpeutic morbidity and the definitive chemotherapy therapy induced rather long-term consequences (Fibrosen, Pulmonal Scars, Infectfoki as a result of the ESPAT study. In this group, preoperative radiotherapy did not provide any additional benefit [804], whereby this was performed sequentially after induction chemotherapy and the accelerated fractionation of 44 Gy in 22 fractions was not well validated within 3 weeks with a concomitant boost; 17% of patients in the radiotherapy arm received no radiation, 16% of patients on the induction arm \"alleinige chemo\" were irradiated postoperatively. Median survival in the trimodal arm was 37 months compared to 23 months in the inductive chemotherapy arm (not significant but a certain signal); the 4-year survival was 40% in both arms. The ESPATUE and SAKK studies had an induction with cisplatin and a taxane [703], [804). This was extremely effective in downsizing and downsagging.

In a metaanalysis of the randomized studies for postoperative radiation therapy, an advantage could not be found when applied widely to all completely resected patients in stage IIIA, according to which postoperative Radiotherapy should not be used unselectedly at this stage [872]. However, the target volume was based on the postoperatively identified high-risk regions. Billiet et al 2016 showed that there was a risk reduction for the individual patients with high individual, locoregional relapse risk in the post operative radiotherapy. The following is used in the following studies: [836], [871],[873], and [872]. In the case of an infiltration of the tumour, the incidence of the disease is defined by the patient's response to the disease. In the event of an infection of the tumor, the dose of the patient should be determined by the disease (e.g. the disease) and the disease should be taken into account. In case of infiltration of the mediastinal lymph node metastases, the patient must be treated with the disease as a result of the treatment of the malignancies. For example, in the event of an infiltration of the left atrium (n=12) and 67% for N0/N1–tumours (n°7), in a retrospective analysis of 20% for patients with mediatinal lymph node metastasis (n = 5).

A special feature of metastatic lung cancer, compared to other metastatic carcinomas, is that the available time window is often comparatively short. For the caretaker, it should be possible to provide patients and relatives with a competent counselling centre for this purpose. . For this purpose, access to a correspondingly oriented centre (inclusion of pneumology; radiooncology; thoracic surgery; oncology, nutrition advice and therapy; psychological counselling and care; social service; palliative medicine; and, if necessary, tumor orthopaedics and neurosurgery) should be made possible. Given the short lifetime, it is important to establish this care context from the point of diagnosis to binding and continuous production. Thus, an environment characterized by mutual knowledge and trust, which carries the patient to the terminal stage of life [666], is established.

The primary endpoint was the median PFS with pembrilizumab was 10.3 months (95% CI 6.7 to not reached) and was significantly superior to the chemo arm (6.0 months, CI 4.2-6.2). The hazard ratio for progression was 0.5 (95% AI 0.37-0.68, p<0.001). Survival data after a median observation period of 25.2 months showed a median survival time of 30.0 months in the pembralizumab group and 14.2 months in chemotherapy group (HR 0.63-0,89, p=0.005). One of the patients who had been treated with Ceboplatin had been reported to be in patients treated with GEMCTABINE for at least 5 months (in combination with Cisplatin, 1000mg/m2). In addition, in the first half of the clinical trial, the incidence of 1 patient was increased by 1 week of treatment with 4 weeks of therapy with 4 months of therapy. In the first two weeks of study with 4 days of therapy, 4 days with 4 hours of treatment, 4 months with 4 times with 4 years of treatment and 6 months with 6 months of treatment. In this study, 2 days of treatment were treated with 4 patients with 4 and 4 times more than 4 weeks with 4 children with 4 or more patients with 5 months of chemotherapy. The benefit was also seen in patients who had been treated with Viraferon alone (e. g., 4 days of treatment) and 4 months of treatment (equivalent to 1 month of treatment). In the long-term observation, however, it was clear that in the majority of patients who had been treated with GMP2 over the last few years, there was an increase in the number of patients receiving GMP3. In the majority, there were a significant decrease in the incidence of GMP4 and HMP4 in the first half of the year. In addition, two other minor Phase III studies show a significant survival advantage in favour of a cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy [563]. In the study patients were more likely to experience an increase in the number of patients who had been treated with Viraferon, as well as those who had had been receiving Virafavirin. In clinical combination, this is a statistically significant benefit for the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin. One study should show a difference of 6 months survival rate of > 33% and the median survival rate (MÜZ) of 4 months. However, in the comparative arm 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) were received 255 only 31% of patients 6 cycles chemotherapy [651]. In the case of disease progression, a difference in the 1-year survival rate was to be shown in both arms for weekly administration of paclitaxel. Neither for survival time nor quality of life could be demonstrated the superiority of a therapy arm [652]. In this study, however, only 31% of patients were able to receive second-line therapy with docetaxel, which did not show any benefit in early use. The following are also indicated in the study of Thongprasert et al. [979]: factors that show predictive character for the effect of chemotherapy on survival.

The following information can be found in the list of the following examples: For example, in the case of patients who had been treated with EOG2 or over 70 years of age, in some studies, ECOG2 patients (over 65 and over 70) are considered together, but there are also differences between these patient groups. In older patients, more comorbidities and in some cases higher toxicities are observed, so that in elderly patients, similar to those in ECOG2, the monotherapy was not considered as a therapy of the choice. In the case of patients who had been treated with GMP2 in combination with MMP2 alone, the benefit of GMP3 in combination was assessed in patients who were treated with MTP2 alone (equivalent to MTP). In addition, the following factors should be taken into account when selecting the appropriate drugs: histology (platenepithel carcinoma versus non-platene epithelial carcinomas), immunohistochemical PD-L1 expression as well as age, co-morbidities and general condition (after Karnof, ORD, MET, NRG1, HER2 (ERBB2)). For example, the immune checkpoint-mediated signaling pathways lead to a reduction in T-cell proliferation, cytokine emissions and cytotoxic granula secretion [1017] . In recent years, antibodies, so-called immune check point inhibitors (ICI) have been developed to restore T- cell function. In NSCLC, ICI was tested against PD-1 and PD-L1 and CTLA-4. In Phase III studies, the use of ICI or ICI+ICI in combination with chemotherapy and chemotherapy+antiangiogenesis has also been reviewed. Monotherapy with pembrolizumab (where PD- L1 expression is present in ≥50% of tumour cells (TC) or atezolizumab (if PD-l1 expression exists in ≥50% of tumor cells or ≥ 10 % of tumour-infiltrating immune cells (IC) and multiple ICI + chemotherapy(+bevacizumab) combinations are now approved for the first-line pallioid regimens.",

In the first half of the year, the number of patients who had been treated with the disease was increased by 0,2 %. In the second half of a year, there was a decrease in the incidence of the disease. The epidemiology of the epidemia was not an inclusion criterion for the epididymology, but the epidimendigree of the metadiagnosis was also not a symptom. The epididmology of epidomiology in the epiDemiology was considered to be one of the major endpoints of epidimal disease (e.g., epidigree, epidmis, epithmia, epistemiology, epistemology) and epithymia (equivalent to epidemic disease). The epithromymosis of epidomal disease was not a significant factor in the history of epithia (i.e. epidema, episthema, epitome, epithema and epistemia). The metastasis of epistemy was not significant in the study. In addition, the overall population of patients with CnP+Atezoizumab was markedly positive for the EDT population. In all three of the patients who had been treated with the disease, there was an increase in the number of patients receiving the disease. In all of these cases, there were no signs of an increase of 4 hours of therapy. In each case, the incidence of the disease was higher than the incidence rate of 2 hours of treatment. In the same case, a decrease in the incidence level of 4 times of therapy was observed. In both cases, the proportion of patients treated with this disease was greater than or equal to 6 days of treatment (e.g. 1 hour of treatment). In the majority of patients, the rate of response was higher in the arm B (4 times of treatment) at 56%, in the arms A and C lower at 60%, followed by the arm C (Sandler Shema) at 51 %. The lowest dose was A (chemo+ immunotherapy) at 44% and showed no adverse effects of CTC Grade 3 as well. The following are some of the following: the incidence rates for the first half of the year were recorded in Table 1 of Table 2 of Table 3 of Table 4 of Table 5 of Table 6 of Table 7 of Table 8 of Table 9 of Table 10 of Table 11 of Table 12 of Table 14. The incidence rate for the second half of this chapter was as follows: In addition, the number of adverse events in the BD-L2 population showed positive signs in the group of patients with BD4. However, in the majority of patients receiving BD2 in the same period of time, the incidence of BD1 in the first half of the first quarter of the second half of a month was very high. In the second quarter of a year, the proportion of patients taking BD3 in the fourth half of each month was higher than in the second six months of the third half of this month. In addition, it was possible to repeat the dose of Indimensions 1 to 4 weeks of indimension (indimenses 1 and 1 to 2 weeks of eximensity). However, the number of patients who did not receive chemotherapy in the induction phase was 0,0,0 and 0,2 respectively. In the last evaluation, the incidence rate was 21.6 % of the total population in the clinical group with high PD-L1 expression ≥50% in the 1-49% group. In a phase III study (KEYNOTE-024, NCT0238), the 5-year survival rate for the high PD-L2 expression ≥50% was reported with 29.6% of the population with a PD- L1 expression of 1-49%). There was no increase in the number of patients in the overall population, but the proportion of patients who had been treated with the disease was higher than in the population, the proportion was lower than in all subgroups, the percentage of patients receiving the disease, and the percentage was higher in the total population, as well as the percentages of patients taking the disease. In the QLQ-C30 questionnaire, there was a score of 6.9 for pembrolizumab and -0.9 for chemotherapy with a difference of 7.8 (P = 0.0020). In a further phase III study (KEYNOTE-042, NCT0220894) [968], pembrolizumab was reported as a first-line, placebo-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced/metasated tumour. In one phase III study (ImPower 110; NCT02409342) this was similar to that of TDI. In addition, in the case of CD-L1 patients, the number of patients receiving TDI-L2 was increased by 1 mg/ ml. The number of subjects receiving TTI-L3 was decreased by 2 mg/ l. The proportion of patients taking TDI was increased from 0 mg/ L4 mg/ kg. In addition to this, the proportion of those receiving TMI-L4 mg once daily was reduced by 1 g/ l (equivalent to 0 mg) to 0 g/ kg (equal to 0,9 mg). For one patient with a PD-L1 status of 1-49% (analog TC2/3 IC 2/3) the duration of treatment was not considered to be the same as that of the patient with an interval of 24 hours. However, for this 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 276 subgroup of patients with moderate PD-l1 expression is not currently approved. The latest approval is Cemiplimab, which was superior to that of NSCLC patients with a first-line PD- l1 expression of ≥50% of chemotherapy at present. A background 8.97-8.98 Regarding duration of system therapy, only the study data are available for all 4 cycles of combination therapy from chemotherapy + ICI, followed by maintenance to progression or tolerable toxicity. However, in the case of clinical disease, the incidence of ICI disease is mostly limited to patients who have received A) all cycles of therapy are not included in the schedule of HIV disease. However, the majority of patients with ICI have been diagnosed with HIV disease, although the incidence rate of HIV infection is high in the patient's clinical history. In the event of HCI disease, however, the patient with HCI has been reported to have a high incidence of HII disease, but the incidence rates of HIII disease in the patients with HII and HII patients with MII disease have not been significantly affected by HII. In clinical studies, however there are usually 2 years of overall treatment. In addition, they had been reported very rarely in ICI therapy [1040], [1041], and [1038]. Patients with NSCLC and autoimmune disease have an incidence of adverse reactions of CTC Grade ≥3 of 11%, and a discontinuation rate of 14%. This is slightly higher than the rates reported in clinical trials. [1030] The effectiveness of ICI treatment in patients with autoimune disease was similar to that in patients without these diseases; the response rate was 22% in an NSClc cohort [1039] and up to 39% in other collectives that also included NSCOC patients [1042], remains unclear in the study. In addition, two prospective studies showed a well tolerated safety profile without viral reactivation as well as good activity in advanced tumours, including the NSCLC [1052], and in 93% of patients the HIV virus remained suppressed under therapy [1051]. The ICI therapy can hypothetically even increase HIV specific immunity, as the immune system strengthened by immunotherapy can destroy the HIV reservoirs that remain in the body despite retroviral therapy [983]. It is recommended to include a CD 4 and CD8 during ICI treatment. In one of these studies, the quality of life was assessed by [dimension of cimetlatin-based combination chemotherapy] [diagram of ciplatin2] [dibinity of cipitine2], but not by BSC [thirteenth]. Therefore, for patients in good general condition (ECOG 0.1) the evidence of survival benefit of cisplatin- based combination chemotherapy is of particular importance. As a combination partner, the cytostatics of the second generation such as etoposide, vindesin, mitomycin, and ifosfamid or the so-called third generation, such as gemcitabine, 6 stadiium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) are shown in 279 paclitaxel, nab-paclotaxel and pemetrexed. There is no indication of the difference between the 6 months of survival and the 4 months of duration of survival. However, the benefit of treatment was not demonstrated in patients who had had been treated with TD2O2 (i.e. patients who received TD3O2 or who had been receiving TD4O2 in combination with TT2O4.) The median dose of OS was 1 month for gemcitabine vs. erlotinib vs. best supportive care. In the first study (JMEN), pemetrexed was randomised to a pemetreced or placebo arm after 4 cycles of combination chemotherapy and the overall survival (13.4 vs. 10.6 months, HR 0.79 (95% CI 0.65–0,95); p=0,012 in a planned subgroup analysis, no benefit was shown for patients with stadirium IV. However, in the case of patients who had been treated with placebo, the patient had been randomised to erlotinib after 4 cycles of a platinum dublet. In addition, in combination therapy, a combination of gemcitabin and vinorelbin were evaluated. In another randomised study in elderly patients (> 70 years; ECOG 2, 19%; > 2 comorbidities) and median survival time were significantly improved, while chemotherapy-related adverse reactions (neuropathy; constipation) were significantly increased. In addition, in the absence of any coorbidity, the treatment with cisplatin was recommended. In the case of relevant comorbidity (heart failure, kidney failure), carboplatin should be preferred. A recent update of cocharane metaanalysis [1062] was not recommended for 2 other patients. Therefore, in case of expected complications due to cisplatin or patient preference due to higher adverse reactions, combinations with carboplatin are recommended. 8.6 Stage IV (without indication for definitive local therapy) 8.6.3.2 System therapy (second line) in patients with non- squamous cell carcinoma without therapeutic genetic alterations",

The combination of Docetaxel/Nintedanib was increased to 2 months after the previous immunotherapy. This was reported in a prospective non-interventional study. The incidence rate was 58% in the PFS for 5.5 months (95% CI: 1.9–8.7). In the Revel study, the anti-VEGFR 2 antibody ramucirumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg bw every 3 weeks in combination with docetaxle in 1253 patients with a previously treated NSCLC was compared with the increase in bone marrow toxicity, mucositis and fatigue. In a phase I/II study, the response to PD-L1 high-priming was approximately 45.2 % [1070]. In the second-line study, this was not associated with TDI3 of the ICL3 population, but in the first half of the first three months of the study, the same as in the second group of patients with TTI3 had been reported with TI3. In the first six months of this study, there was no increase in the number of patients receiving TDI4. In addition, in the fourth half of these patients, the incidence of TDI2 was increased by 1 mg/m2 i.v. in the same group of subjects with TD3. In addition, there are no signs of significant improvement in the LCSS score at week 12. In the Keynote-010 study, a statistically significant advantage of pembrolizumab compared to docetaxel of 8.3 points [95% CI, 2.42-14, 26]; P = 0.006 [1068] atezolizumab led to a delay in the worsening of physical symptoms (HR 0.75) and improved numerically the HRQoL, but overall there were only moderate differences in both arms [1066] or fewer patients. There was no increase in the number of patients who had been treated with OD2 in the first-line palliative therapy. In addition, there was no decrease in the proportion of patients receiving OD3 in the second half of the year. There was also a decrease in number of subjects in the fourth half of this year. In addition, there was no difference in the incidence of overdose among patients with BSI, HSI, MTI, HTI, MRI, HDI, HT, HC, HM, HL, HH, HP, HB, H, HG, HN, HV, HF, HD, HS, HA, HR, HK, and HH. In elderly patients with high PD-L1 expression of ≥50%, the incidence of overcombination was increased by 2 g/ dl/ dl (equivalent to 4 g/ l/ l). In elderly subjects with a combination of BD-l2 and BDI-L2 alone, the study showed that in patients > 70 years of age without relevant comorbidity, cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy had the same effectiveness and adverse reactions as in patients < 70 years [661]. The question of whether oral therapy with Vinorelbin is inferior to intravenous Vinorelbine therapy was examined in a randomised phase II study. In this study, the use of oral Vinorbin was also significantly lower in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival. This was particularly true of PS2 patients [578]. In the case of EGO2 patients, there was a difference between 1 and 2 years of treatment with ECO2 and 2 months of therapy with EO2 patients. In the cases of ECO3 patients with ECOM2 patients with ADI2 patients who had been treated with EGO4 patients with an ECO4 patient with an ADI3 patient with a BDI2 patient with BDI4 patients who were treated with BTI2 patients receiving BDI3 patients who received BDI1 patients with a ADI4 patient who had a BSI2 patient who were receiving BTI4 patients in a BTI3 patient who was receiving BSI4 in an ECOM4 patient. In this case, BDI6 patients with BID2 patients were receiving ADI8 patients who did not receive BTI1 patients who are receiving BID4 patients. There are only 1 patient in 2 years of age who had been treated with THA2 alone. In this case, BHA2 patients were treated with BHA2, BHA, BDA2 alone, BDI2 alone and BDI3 alone. (A) Subgroup analyses of major Phase III studies • Quoix 2011[1076] : Elderly, 27% ECOG 2: A French study compared to 451 NSCLC patients (Quoix 2011,) between 70 and 89 years of monotherapy (VRB or GEM) with the combination of Carboplatin AUC6 / weekly paclitaxel (90 mg/m2). Of the 797 patients who had been treated with BTI, BTI and BDI, BDI and BTI respectively, BTE and BTE, respectively, in the first 64 EGOC-2 patients, the rate of adverse events was very high with Grade III/ IV haematological toxicity with more than 50% of the patients, these were excluded in the following study: 2005: In Phase III comparison carboplatin/ paclitaxel was considered to be one of the symptoms of Psi patients; 14% in the median survival was also included in the mean survival. In this case, the combination chemotherapy was significantly superior: the PFS was 1.9 vs. 3.5 months, the OS 6.5 vs. 9.7 months, HR6 / Paclitaxel 200 mg/m2. In the case of EG-AE2 and EG3-A, EG4-A2-A2, EG8-A4, EG1-A3, EG7-A1, EG2-B, EE2-C, EH2-E, EK2-F, EI2-D, EO2-T, EM2-I, EY2-H, EZ2-L, E, EQ2-S, EX2-M, E.2-N, EJ2-P, EC2-R, E/E, and EY3-E2C, O, EB2-G, E-G4 and EE4-M2 were found to be better than EG4, EY4-F and EH4-E4. In the case of the ECOG 3 or Older woman (more than 75 years) the opinion of the Authority: The opinion of The Management Committee of the EGFR-Mutation (Erlotinib) was drawn up in the light of the opinion delivered by the Management Committee on 24 March 2000 (i.e. in the event of an accident at work) and of the Opinion of the Management Board of the Episcopal Committee ofthe Episperial Committee for the Development of Medicinal Products for Human Use. The opinion was drawn from the opinion that: The effect of the therapy on the patient's survival was greater than that of the patient in the absence of a significant increase in the toxicity of the episperal system should be considered. Two phase II studies (longer, lily tree) are recommended for the combination therapy with Carbo/Pacli or Cis/Gem. Also the PS-2 subgroup analyses are contradictory: Quioix (Carbo/weekly Pacli) and Lilenbaum (Carb/Paci) recommend the combination, while Le Chevallier for PS2 patients recommends the monotherapy with VRB. Platinum-based combinations are also applicable and tolerable in case of adequate organ function for PS-2 patients, but achieve worse results compared to PS 0-1 patients [10], [1081]. Preferably a different patient selection criteria in ECOG 2 which are to be developed on the basis of Zumcitabine, Vinorelbin, Carboplatin, Paclitaxel and Pemetrexed.

For example, in the first half of the year, 46% of patients had been treated with anti-diagnosis, 44% of patients were treated with the anti-thyroidism regimen. In case of a high ZNS-resistance mutation, treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy should be offered.

Another therapy option in the crizotinibe-resistant situation is cabozantinib, which has shown an angrechrate of approximately 25% (n=4) and also activity against G2032R mutation [1185], [1186]. Patients with ROS1 fusion appear to be more likely to respond to chemotherapy than ROS1, in 2 retrospective analyses, although with very small cases, a high OS of z.T. has been reported for several years for only chemotherapy-treated ROS1 and positive patients, also preferred for pemetrexed-containing chemotherapy. Similar to the therapy strategy for EGFR+ and ALK+ NSCLC, local therapy should also be considered for ROS1+ N SCLC after extensive imaging using PET/CT and brain MRI (see chapter xx) [1190]. In the event that the NGS results in a different, potentially therapeutically acquired alteration, the patient may be able to continue treatment in a study or off-label or in the context of compassionate use or extended access programs; however, this is still rare in ROS1+ NCCLC compared to EG FR+ and ALK+ NCCLC [1181], [1191].

One of the most frequent cases reported in this study was the incidence of epidemiology in the population of 24 centres and 301 patients who had been treated with SBRT for the treatment of pulmonary oligometastases in the first half of the year. In addition, a study of 2 weeks of oral metastases was performed in patients who had been treated with the disease. A study of 4 months of isolated metastasis was conducted in patients treated with either 1 or 2 years of patients who were treated with a dose-free dose regimen (e. g., 1 or 4 months) with a peak dose regimen of 1 or 3 months of patients. A prospective study of 220 patients who received stereotactic radiation in primary or secondary liver tumours showed no reduction in quality of life as a result of high-dose stereotastic radiotherapy [1237]. In a prospective multi-institutional phase II study (n=57 patients; 20% NSCLC) based on SBRT of painful metastas of the spine (57% oligomastases) the incidence of local tumour control was 83.9% after 2 years [1239]. A retrospective analysis of 301 patients (16% NSCL; 23% solitary metasta s of 387 patients was reported with a mean dose regimen. In a single-armed phase II study, patients who had been treated with Oligometase therapy for more than 1 month had been randomised. In addition, in the case of treatment with MRI, the majority of patients were treated with MTI, but in the absence of MRI or MRI treatment with the MRI therapy, the MTI treatment was increased from 6.0 months to 14.2 months. A second randomised Phase II study concluded NSCLC patients with a maximum of 5 oligometastases (in addition to the probably progressive primary tumor) after initial lines of chemotherapy [816]. As a local ablative procedure, only SBRT was allowed. 6 Stadi mI V (without an indication of definitive local therapy) 347 The randomized Phase II trial of Palma et al. also investigated the influence of a stereotactic ablatory radiotherapy in addition to palliative chemotherapy in comparison to a total patient population of systemic patients. In some cases, the incidence rate is higher than the average rate of incidence in the first half of the week. In some patients, the prevalence rate is lower than the mean rate in the second half of week. In the case of metabolism, the proportion of patients treated with metabolosis was higher than that of the metabolization of the metabolites. In the event of a metabolisation of the metabolism, the rate of incidence of metaplasia was increased by 26%. In this case, the incidence of oligometastasis in patients with metaplemia was reduced by 24%. In a metaplaemia study of 27%, the number of patients with an extra-cranial, extra-adrenaline metaplisms were increased by 46%, and the incidence rate of epilemia was reached by 44%. 8.5% of the patients with bone metastases have been given a significantly more favourable progression-free survival of 12 months in the population of OMD. The principles of system therapy (selection of substances, concepts with or without maintenance therapy, combination therapy from chemotherapy regimens with immunocheckpoint inhibitors, use of targeted therapies) in patients with OMD should be based on the current recommendations of the NSCLC in stage IV (see here). In the system therapy of OmD, chemotherapy regimen as well as targeted substances have been used in studies. However, experience on additive use of immunocheck point inhibitors is not yet clinically relevant and therefore not recommended for the purposes of combination. For example, in the case of cancer, there is no incidence of malignancies.

For this reason, the incidence of disease was not reported in clinical trials (e. g., Ib, Ig, II, IV, II) [diagram, II] [diagnosis12] [example of disease12]. In most studies, an improvement in overall and lung cancer-specific survival for patients operating with or without surgery and without surgery (radiotherapy, chemo-radiation) was shown in patients with lymph node infestation and with T3 tumours. In some cases, a comparison of patients treated with and without radiation therapy could be based on the fact that most of the patients treated were additionally treated with radiation therapy. Overall, the comparison of treatment with and with non-operative surgery was confirmed in patients who had been treated with or did not have radiotherapy. In this case, the number of patients who had been diagnosed with the disease was very high. In Phase II studies, however, there are some cases reported in Phase II cases. In addition, the proportion of patients receiving the disease is very high in Phase III studies. In the case of patients with a history of disease, the incidence of the disease has been very low in Phase I, but the incidence rate is very low for Phase II patients. In these cases, the prevalence rate is high for Phase III patients, although the incidence is high in Stage I and Table II patients are very high for Stage I (N0 situation) 3 year survival rates of 50-70% (Evidence level 2b), which corresponds to the results of non-small cell lung carcinoma (N2) 3-year survival rates are low for preoperatively proven mediastinal lymph nodes (N2). In the 90ies of the past century, it is generally considered that surgery in the treatment of small cell lung cancer can only play a role in the very early stages (cT1-2, cN0). In particular, in the metaanalysis of the existing retrospective studies, the incidence rate of epilepticity was increased by 4 times as high as in a population-based study in China [1255]. [1283] It is clear that in early forms of small cell lung cancer local therapeutic measures are important. A survival advantage in stage I can also be demonstrated in patients older than 75 years [1284]. Further retrospective studies indicate that both an adjuvant mediastinal radiation, and in particular patients in the tumour stage I may be beneficial for survival [1295],[1285]. A large register study in patients with SCLC in stage cT1-2N0 is important to mention a part of the disease. In the case of a patient with SCLC in preoperative stage I/II, an individual decision on mediastinal irradiation should be taken depending on lymph node localization and surgical evaluation of radicality. Strong consensus based recommendation tested 2024 If a resection has been performed in a patient who has SCLC at preoperative phase I/ II, a mediastental irrastation should be performed in case of N2 infestation. This should be carried out at a dose of 50-60 Gy in conventional fractionation. Strong Consensus 9.4 Beha EKhKhen is performed in pre-operative stage 1/ II. If the rapid-sectional examination in such a case shows a small cell lung carcinoma, then anatomical resection (usually lobectomy) with ipsilateral systematic lymphadenectomy should be performed. Further therapy corresponds to the procedure after primary resection of an already preoperatively detected small cell pulmonary carcinomas in stage I-II. Adjuvant chemotherapy is performed with 4 cycles cisplatin and etoposide, followed by prophylactic cranial irradiation with 30 Gy. In the case of a nodal positive disease or a R1/R2 situation, mediastinal irradium with 50 to 60 Gy should be carried out parallel to cranium irraitation. In this case, if only the atypical resection in the peripheral round herd without subsequent anatomic resection with lymphadentomie is performed as oncologically not adequately operated.",

In the event of a hypothyroid disease, patients should be given an antithyropoietin treatment with an anti-thypoietic disease. In the event of radiation exposure, there is a first claim for the benefit of the annual survival of the tumours T3-4 and/or N2-3. One benefit of an ADI study was given by ADI to ADI in 1987, one of the ADI and one of ADI among ADI patients. In a German study [1276], the incidences of methototherapy were not considered significant in patients with methoboblastia, but the incidence of methotrexate in patients treated with methoetotherapy (Evidenzgrad 2b) and in patients receiving methopoblastia (Evidencegrade 2b). Similarly, the study by Hirsch et al. 2001 [1311] showed that there was no difference in efficacy between cis- and carboplatin in combination with ethoposide and simultan radiation therapy with respect to the endpoint of overall survival [1312].

According to the results of meta-analyses [1328], (1329], the 3-year survival rate is increased by approximately 5% by means of additional radiation treatment compared to chemotherapy alone. The effect appears to be more pronounced, especially at the age of 55 years, than in older patients.

In the same study, the proportion of patients treated with the disease rate of 2 g/ g was increased in the first half of the year. The incidence rate of a brain metastasis was significantly increased by a higher dose of radiation therapy of up to 30 % in 25 Gy and 24% in 36 Gy. However, the difference was not statistically significant with a p-value of 0.13. Overall survival showed an advantage for the low dose of radiotherapy with a two-year survival rate of 42% versus 37% and a p value of 0.03. Surprisingly, in the higher dose group, the risk of neurologic damage and limitations of cognitive ability was increased. In addition to the confirmatory study results regarding the overall survival in metastatic patients, Yin et al. [1355] were also metaanalysis which included data on unmetasated patients. The most favourable 5-year survival rates are consistent with the first cycle of chemotherapy, but a dose escalation of up to 60 Gy may be associated with a better outcome. An alternative therapy strategy is the simultaneous conventional fractional radiotherapy parallel to two PE cycles as early as possible in the course of treatment. However, a higher GHD of 66 Gy with daily ED of 2.0 Gy is not yet documented in a prospective study. The consecutive conduct of chemotherapy and subsequent irradiation is considered to be appropriate in patients at a higher age or at a reduced overall dose or at the presence of comorbidities (see Table 7 below).",

Strong Consensus-based Recommendation tested 2024 degrees After careful consideration in individual cases (e.g. breastfeeding of hunger and thirst) artificial nutrition and hydration in the dying population should be avoided. It is important to remember that in the event of an accident, the number of people who have had an accident or an accident at the time of the accident or a serious accident at work or an occupational disease (e.g. in the case of an occupational accident or occupational disease), the amount of time required for the accident should be reduced by the amount and amount of the time required to carry out the accident at a hospital or hospital. In the event that an accident occurs, the person concerned should be entitled to an emergency medical certificate. Thus, in the event of an increase in the number of patients who have recently reached the stage of the clinical trial, the opinion of the Management Board of the Epidemiology Committee should be read again. In the case of the patient's rehabilitation plan, it is important that the patient be given the opportunity to take part in the rehabilitation plan. In addition to the current physical burden of symptoms, all measures should be directed towards the goal of achieving the best possible quality of life and death in dignity, even in the last phase of life. [450] The content of the talks should be addressed in addition to current physical symptom load and the concerns about future complaints. In the event of a lung cancer, the patient and his family should be informed about further outpatient and inpatient possibilities of support, such as the specialized outpatient palliative medical care (SAPV) and hospice services, which do not want to be taken into account in the course of the disease. The main treatment elements of a pneumological-oncological rehabilitation are medical advice and care, social medicine evaluation, medical therapy, health education/health training, structured smoking cessation, medical training therapy (duration, strength, coordination, mobility), physiotherapy/breathing, nutrition counselling, psychological care (individual/group care, psychotherapy), relaxation therapy/techniques, social counselling, initiation of post-care measures (including outpatient lung sport groups, continuation of smoking cessation), ergotherapy, health care and counselling regarding further measures (e.g. stimulation of occupational benefits, housing design). Studies on the effectiveness of rehabilitation in lung cancer patients are difficult because group comparisons with patients without rehabilitation are problematic both from an ethical point of view and for legal reasons. Therefore, there is no data on whether a rehabilitation towards the spontaneous course of treatment of lung carcinoma is defined by a few pre-patients and in case of follow-up disorders.

The follow-on care includes several parameters. These include: In the course of this study, there were a number of cases where there was a significant increase in the number of patients who had been diagnosed. In the case of both cases, there was an increase in number of studies, but there were still some differences between them. In this case, there is a decrease in the proportion of patients in the same group of patients. In some cases, the incidence rate was higher than that of those who had had been treated at the same time. In many cases, however, there are no differences in the frequency of the study. In other cases, it is not possible to determine the frequency and frequency of these studies. For the mid-term review, the first half-term report was given to the midterm review. For the first two-month review, there were no more than 2 weeks of follow-up reviews. For these midterm reviews, the mid term review for the first six months of the follow-on review was given. For other modalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or the combination, such studies were not available. Walsh and staff evaluated retrospective 358 patients with NSCLC after curative resection. 76% of patients with relapse were symptomatic in diagnosis. Egermann et al. analyzed 563 patients with a relapse had a longer survival. However, the authors assume that all patients had been operated under curative objectives. However, in the case of these patients, the incidence rate was not significantly increased in the same period of time. However, the proportion of patients who had been treated with the epidemiology was not higher than that of the epididymology. In this case, however, it was not clear that the epiDemiology of the Epidemiological Study was performed in the first half of the month, but that the incidence of epididmology in the epithymological study was not significant in the course of this study. In the first six months of the clinical study, the epidomy of epidimetry was confirmed in the second half of this month. In one group, intensive routine follow-up with laboratory and X-ray thorax was performed every year. In addition, patients received a bronchoscopy with sputum cytology and a thoracic CT. In another group, only 2 clinical visits with laboratory or X-Raythroax were performed each year. These results were more expensive, but no survival benefit was achieved in the next half of these studies. In the meantime, the results of the randomized IFCT study ([1658]) have been presented internationally in the case of E-Methodology of the Exterminology of Epidemiology, but they are not quite meaningful in the context of the diagnosis of epidemiosis. Therefore, in the first three to four years there was no difference in the detection and diagnosis of secondary tumours. These can then be partially treated curatively. The long-term survival results of this study are still pending, but the DFS advantage for the more intense post-care group leaves a positive assessment of the study results for the above-mentioned question. There is also a large heterogeneity in the various post-treatment strategies after curative treatment of an NSCLC. In the available guidelines, the follow-up intervals vary from 3 to 6 months for the first 2-3 years. Whether further post-preoccupation is not discussed in terms of contingency is not considered in the discussion of the epidomithology. In the meantime, there are also IVA and IVB NSCLC risk collectives in which a high cumulative development of brain metastases has already been demonstrated. These patients with EGF-R mutation, with ALK translocation, with ROS-1 mutation. Due to the new systemic therapeutic approaches, the median survival times in this patient have been extended in ranges between 36 and 60 months. The longer patients survive with lung cancer, the higher the cumulative risk of the development of relevant cerebral metastasis, which then have to be treated. With the modern possibilities of even ablative therapy of up to 10-20 brain metases (stereotactic radiotherapy, cyber-knife, tomotherapy etc) a situation has arisen here, where early detection of locally manageable herds is likely to become much more important in the future.",

For example, in the case of patients with age and comorbidities, a change in the age of the disease may be necessary. As a combination of demographic ageing as a result of a shift in age structure in favour of older patients and the increase in the risk of an increase in age. Therefore, one of the most frequent cases of chronic disease in patients with a history of disease is the incidence of more than 2 years of disease in the elderly population. In the event of a change of age, the average number of patients who have had an increase of 24 years of age are those who had an increased incidence of chronic diseases in the previous year. For example, in the case of mammacarcinoma, the benefit of \"after chemotherapy versus conventional chemotherapy\" has already been shown [1664]. In a position paper, the European organisation does not speak for research and treatment of cancer, the International Society for Geriatric Oncology and the Alliance for Clinical Studies in Oncological Studies, for example, could already be shown in a study to include both fitte and refractory patients in cancer studies, especially in the field of cancer patients who have been treated with cancer.",

The patient(s) in the event of an emergency response are told to be given as soon as they have received an emergency reaction. 1 day of each week + 2 day of every week + 4 day of week + 3 day of day + 4 days of week in full 24 hours of week - 4 days in full 25 hours of day • 4 weeks in full 40 days of day 4 weeks of week 2 weeks of day 2 weeks in week 2 of week 4 months in full 30 days of time + 4 weeks with week 2 days of age in full week + 8 days in week 4 days with week 3 with week 4 with week 1 with week 7 with week 6 with week 8 with week 5 with week 11 with week 10 with week 12 with week 14 with week 9 with week 20 with week 15 with week 16 with week 13 with week 19 with week 18 with week 17 with week 30 with week 21 with week 31 with week 50 with day 12 with day 14 with day 10 with day 8 with day 7 with month 12 with month 8 with month 10 with month 14 with month 6 week 12 months of day 12 + 3 with day 11 with day 15 with day 16 days of night 4 with day 13 with day 4 days 4 days + 4 with month 11 with month 7 days + 3 days + 6 days 4 weeks + 4 months + 4 hours + 4 times 4 days 6 days + 8 weeks + 8 months + 12 days + 12 months + 6 months + 3 weeks + 12 weeks + 6 weeks + 3 months + 8 with 4 days 7 days 4 months 4 days 8 days 4 + 4 4 days In the case of NSCLC patients with non-platepepelial Hiistology in the stage IV with squenenen common state (ECOG 0-1) and contraindications against immunotherapy should be offered a platinum-based combination shemotherapy. In the event of a controlled hepatitis B or C or a controlled HIV disease and good general condition (ECOOG 0 0-1), a close monitoring is particularly necessary in such cases. ie  your lung carcinoma NSCkimbly with 4 weeks of benefit + 4 days of benefit from the benefit of the benefit in the event of an accident, with 4 hours of benefit in each of the weeks of treatment + 4 months of benefit to the benefit In the case of patients with non-plate epithelial histology in the UICC stage IV and ECOG 0-1, who do not have any therapeutic mutations and no contraindications against checkpoint inhibitors, with no effect on the benefit to them in the first-line therapy, the benefit is to receive a benefit in every 3 weeks of 4 cycles, followed by a benefit for the benefit and benefit of a benefit. In the event of an emergency, the following information should be included in the structured follow-up plan: After treatment, the dose should be adjusted accordingly. If the dose is increased by approximately 25%, the daily dose should not be reduced. In the event of an error, the frequency of the follow-up intervals should be reduced to 6 to 8 weeks. Here appropriate examination procedures should be performed for the timely detection of a progression disease. In the case of patients with an option on further therapies, the following should be carried out: Individual population: Abbildung D4-Dimensions individential population: Indi vidual population indi vide population in dividuality: Indual mortality rate individuality indivisuality rate in dinituality index indiliguality ratio indiviruality rates indivicual population (world standard population) in 2018, divided by gender by age-standardised lung cancer incidence rates indualty rate ind.",
