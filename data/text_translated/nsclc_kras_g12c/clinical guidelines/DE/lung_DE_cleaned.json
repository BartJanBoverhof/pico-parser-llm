Consensus Epidemiological studies (Hiroshima and Nagasaki, occupational and medical exposures) have clearly demonstrated the risk of cancer in the dose range above 100 mSv, ionic radiation increases the risk of cancer. This additional cancer risk, as well as the genetic risk generated by ionizing radiation, is called stochastic radiation. According to the current state of knowledge [91], it is also assumed that the cancer risk increases linearly, ohn lower threshold dose, with the dose (so-called linear-non-threshold hypothesis). Based on the linear-non-threshold hypothesis, the epidemiological studies have proven that the lung is one of the relatively highly radiation sensitive organs. A detailed description of the correlations can be found in the chapter \"Epidemiology\".

In areas with increased radon concentration in the ground, the actual indoor load should be determined and remedial measures adapted to the state of the building should be taken. In the case of new buildings, the corresponding structural measures should be planned from the outset.

In the patients, a radical mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed. He distinguished the microscopic infestation of a single lymph node level (mN2L1), the microscopic infestation of several lymph node stations (mN2L2+), the preoperatively detected in the computer tomogram of a single lymph node station (cN2L1) and the preoperatively known infestation of several lymph node stations (cN2L2+).

Based on such data, a further subdivision of the mediastinal ipsilateral lymph node infestation is useful. In the TNM system, a subdivision of N2 is recommended for prospective collection of data [709]. For everyday clinical use, the American College of Chest Physicians has proposed the following classification in its guidelines according to Robinson and colleagues [341], [340], IIIA1 (mediastinal lymph node metastases detected in the postoperative histological treatment of one or more lymph node levels), IIIA2 (intraoperative detection of a lymph node level), IIIA3 (infection of one or more headings, prestinologically) PET, non-abiologically fixed by means.",

The receptor-ligand interaction leads to inhibition of cytotoxic effector function of T lymphocytes. The first immune checkpoint inhibitor approved for the treatment of lung carcinoma was the fully humanized anti-PD1 antibody nivolumab. This PD-1 antibody inhibits the PD1-PDL1 interaction and activates the immune system against the tumor. In the study Checkmate 17 [810], nivolumab was evaluated in the second-line therapy of squamous cell carcinoma compared to the standard-2nd line chemotherapy docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in one phase III survival study.",
