With regard to the mentioned recommendations for therapy and selection as well as dosage of medications, the greatest possible care has been taken. Nevertheless, users are asked to use the manufacturer's package leaflets and technical information for inspection and to consult a specialist in case of doubt. Fragile inconsistencies should be communicated in the general interest of the OL editorial office. The user remains responsible for any diagnostic and therapeutic application, medication and dosage. In this guideline, registered trademarks (protected product names) are not particularly identified.

No part of the work may be reproduced in any form without written approval of the ÖL editorial department. This applies in particular to reproductions, translations, microfilms and storage, use and utilization in electronic systems, intranets and the Internet. German Cancer Aid has set itself the goal of jointly promoting and supporting the development and development of and the use of scientifically-based and practical guidelines in oncology with the Oncology (OL) guidance programme. The basis of this programme is based on the medical-scientific findings of the specialist societies and the DGG, the consensus of medical experts, users and patients, as well as on the rules for the development of guidelines for the AWMF and the professional support and funding of the German Cancer Assistance. In order to reflect the current state of medical knowledge and take into account medical progress, guidelines must be regularly reviewed and continued. The application of the A WMF regulation should be a basis for the creation of high-quality oncological guidelines. Since guidelines are an important instrument of quality assurance and quality management in onkology, they should be introduced in a targeted and sustainable manner into everyday care. Thus, active implementation measures and evaluation programmes are an integral part of the promotion of the Onkology guidance programme here. The aim of the programme is to create professional and medium-term financial prerequisites for the design and provision of high quality guidelines. The guidelines are listed below: • Guidelines on Oncology • AWMF • Guidelines International Network Previous versions of the guideline as well as supplementary documents (Guideline Report, Evidence Tables, if applicable Evidence Reports) are listed in the guidelines archive. The guideline is also included in the app of the guidelines program Onkology.

These funds were used for personnel-costs and for the procurement of literature and consensus conferences (moderator fees). The guideline was prepared in editorial independence from the funding organisation. All members provided a written explanation of any conflicts of interests during the Guidelines Process. The conflicts of interest disclosed in the first, second and third paragraphs of Method 34 are set out in the Guidelines Report (Chapter 11.2). The management of conflicts of interests was defined in the preparation of version 2 and maintained in version 3 and provides for the following measures: High thematic conflicts of conflict of interest • Owner interests (patent, copyright, share ownership) Consequence: Abstention/no participation in discussions Moderate thematic conflict of interests in connection with industry in the form of: • Adviser/expert activity • Participation in an advisory board • Conduct of clinical studies Consequential: Abuse, limited to issues with conflict of conflict in the shape of a double vote (blind coordination with and without persons with conflictof interest Low thematic conflicts in relation to industry in terms of:• Presentation/or training activities • Author/co-authorship Consequent: If applicable, restriction of the management function – in this Guideline due to the protection factors systematic search, review of the chapters and neutral moderation are not carried out. Moreover, the rules on dissuasions have not been adopted, however, in the case of dissions are not included in the conclusions. However, it was suggested that individuals who see a conflict of interest in individual questions should report this and not participate in the vote. The results of the conflict of interests assessment and the consequences are to be found in the table in the guidelines report. At this point we would like to thank all employees for their exclusively voluntary participation in the project. 3.1 Incide Table Vergleic Europe's Age Country Schwe Österr Deutsc 1 Schwe denz 35 Epidemiology Incidence The Society of the Epidemic Cancer Register in Germany e.V. together with the Center for Cancer Registry Data of the Robert Koch Institute determines the number of all cancer new diseases, in particular the age-specific incidence of lung cancer in men and women. In 2018, 35.290 men and 21.930 women were affected by lung cancer. In Switzerland, the median age of disease was 69 (women) and 70 (men) years respectively. Statistics Austria published results from cancer registration in 2018 were found to be similar in the period of male cancer in Austria. As in Germany and Austria, lung cancer in Switzerland is the second most common tumor in man after prostate cancer. In Austria, pulmonary cancer is also the second-most common among women, whereas in Germany, and in Switzerland, it is still the third most common cancer after breast and colon cancer. Altogether lung cancer accounts for 11% to 12% of all cancer diagnoses in all three countries.The following table shows the age-standardised incidence rates for the three mentioned countries, which are consistently slightly higher for men in Germany than in Austria and Switzerland, whereas the results for women are comparable. e 8: Age-standardized new disease rates by gender in international ch, ICD-10 C33 – C34, 2017 – 2018 or last year available per 100,000 (old standard) standard standard standardized new disease rate 2017-2018 Women Men eiz 1 31,4 48.3 rich 30,4 49,1 chland 31.6 56.7 eiz: Data on incidence only for 2017Source: Centre for Cancer Registry Data in the Robert Koch Institute",

Thus, lung cancer is still by far the most common cause of cancer deaths among men and the second most common among women in the three countries. According to the incidence, mortality rates in Germany are also higher than in Switzerland and Austria (see Table 5).

However, the absolute incidence of the incidence in Austria is still declining in the last two years. In spite of the decline in incidence rates among men, the RKI for Germany is still expecting an increase in absolute incidence rates to a total of 59,700 due to the increasing incidence among women and demographic trends by 2022. The increase in the proportion of adenocarcinomas observed in Germany and other countries in both sexes is not fully understood, and there are likely to be a number of factors involved. Changes in smoking behaviour (including entry age and smoking duration) and tobacco products, but also in diagnostics, as well as environmental influences that may cause adenoscarcinoma [1]. Adenocarcinom is the most common type of tumour among non-smokers [2] [3]. Socioeconomic status The lung cancer risk is not only inversely correlated with socio-economic status [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. The incidence of lung cancer in populations with low incomes, low occupational status and low levels of education is higher than in groups with high socioeconomic status [5]. On a regional level in Germany, the incidence of lung cancer is only increased in men in areas with low socio-economic status [4]. In women, small-scale data do not show a significant relationship between regional socioeconomic status and lung cancer. One explanation would be that socio- economic differences in smoking behaviour in women have only developed later, towards the end of the 20th century [4]. Ultimately, the socioeconomic status correlates with survival after diagnosis. Individual income is inversely associated with mortality [6]. A lower regional socio-professional status is also associated with a lower 5-year survival rate in Germany [11], [12]. In an international comparison, a opposite relationship is observed: New disease and death rates are higher in countries with higher life expectancy, higher education, higher gross social product (HDI human development index) than in countries where HDI is lower (see Figure 2) [13].",

More than 100 epidemiological studies on lung cancer risks due to active smoking have been re-evaluated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is part of the World Health Organisation [18]. The results of the risk assessment can be summarised as follows: • The duration of smoking is the most important factor. • The earlier you start smoking and the longer you smoke, the higher the risk. • Smoking increases the risk for all histological cell types. • Quitting smoking reduces the risk; • The sooner you quit smoking, the greater the benefit. •The carcinogenic effect of smoking can be comparable for men and women. • Smoke increases the risks for all the histologic cell types of young people. In 2013, around 25 percent of the German population smoked in the age of 18 years, about three quarters of the smokers' daily exposure to smoking, but more than 20 percent of those who smoked in adults. After German children and adolescents took a leading position in the 7 risik kofakto oren 44 cigarette smoking for a long time in international comparison, a downward trend has now started. In 2015, around 10 percent of male and female adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years [20] smoked. The average age in which girls and boys smoke their first cigarette was between 13 and 14 years of age in 2015. In a European study [21], men are at a 24-fold higher risk of lung cancer for current cigarette smokers than for life-long non-smokers. Ex-smokings have a 7.5-fold greater risk. The corresponding risk estimates for women are 8.7 for smokers and 2 for ex-smoking women. Also, the consumption of cigars, cigarillo or pipe tobacco was associated with a significantly higher lung cancer risk. For men, the risk of developing lung cancer was around 10.000 % for a cigar/cigarillo smoker or pipe smoker, respectively, 8 times higher in comparison to non-smoking [22]. In total, smoking in the EU is found to be due to 85% of the number of women's lung cancer. In Germany, some 36,000 people (26,000 men, 10,000 women) die from lung cancer due to smoking [24]. Passive smoking Passive smoke is a proven human cancer. IARC, on the basis of its classification as human cancer, anticipated a summary assessment of more than 50 epidemiological studies on lung cancer and passive smoking [25]. This meta-analysis shows an approximately 24% higher risk of lung cancer for women who have ever been exposed to passive smoking exposure by the partner compared to those who have never been exposed. For men, the risk estimate is 37%. Most studies, which have also taken into account the duration of living with a smoker or the number of cigarettes smoked by the partners in the analyses, show an increased risk in the highest exposure category [25 ],[26] meta-analyses on passive smoking exposures in childhood by parents also show a relationship with lung cancer %. However, the evidence for a connection between pulmonary cancer and passiv smoking in childhood is less consistent than in adulthood [26], but the incidence of exposure was not increased in the workplace. In the case of women exposed to passive smoke at work, the risk of lung cancer is increased by about 19 %, but in men the sample size was relatively small [25]. A meta-analysis of the exposure-effect relationship between lung cancer and passive smoke in the workplace reports a doubling of the lung cancer risk [28] for persons who spent many years in heavily smoked workplaces. The Senate Commission on the Examination of Health-Disabled Agents of the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) has classified passive smoke as a human cancer in 1998 [29]. There is a good data basis for the assumption that the lung carcinoma risk is to be assessed for long-term exposure, which regularly doubles the overall work layer, as with work in restaurants, beer bars and discotheques. If it is a lifelong non-smoker with non-essential non-working passive smoke exposure, it is possible to test for §9 Abs. 2 of the Occupational Disease Regulation [30]. The quantitative estimate of the 7 risks is good in the case case study of lowace32 and of lowocace32. Estimation of the 7 risik kofakto oren 45 exposure in individual cases is quite good according to the model of Repace and Lowrey (1993) and Repace (2000) possible [31], [32],[33]. The classification of passive smoking as a causal risk factor for lung cancer is justified as follows: • The risk of lung cancer obviously increases with increasing exposure and is significantly increased in the highest exposure category. • The detection of a risk increase was carried out on a broad epidemiological basis – regardless of the location or design of the study. • the risk increase corresponds to approximately 260 lung cancer deaths or 280 lung cancers per year [34]. Radon, radioactive sources and X-ray radiation Radon-222 is a naturally occurring radioactive noble gas that arises within the decay series of long-lived uranium and thorium nuclides contained in rocks and soils. The main contribution to the natural radiation exposure of the population is due to the inhalation of radioactive radon, in particular in geological regions of Germany, e.g. in the Bavarian forest and in the ore Mountains, or on the basis of overcrow, can be found in small areas. The inhalation of radon and its decay products leads to exposure of the bronchial epithelium to the released alpha radiation. In contrast, doses for other organs and tissues are low. A European pooling study has shown that a linear exposure-effect relationship can be assumed. Per 100 Bq/m3 corrected radon exposure can be expected to increase relative risk by 16% [35]. This data situation requires interventions to reduce radon exposures [36]. In Germany, the mean radon concentration in dwellings is 49 Bq /m3 and the mean concentration in the open space is 9 Bq perm3. In terms of the maximum avoidable concentration of 40 Bq_m3, an amount of 5% of rason in homes to the lung cancer risk results, which corresponds to 1896 lung cancer deaths per year [37]. Very high activity concentrations of radone and its disintegration products were found in the uranium mining of Wismut AG in the former GDR. In particular, during the so-called \"wild years\" from 1946 to 1955, a high exposure of radiation to the workers is very high. The current data on radon exposure can be found in the Federal Office of Radiation Protection's radon map, which is available online. Flight personnel are exposed to natural cosmic radiation. In Germany, a total of 39 449 persons (previous year: 40 404) were monitored in 2013, the average effective annual dose was 1.9 mSv as in the previous year. The highest annual dose of persons is 6.2 mS v. The flight personnel, which can receive more than 1 7 risik kofakto oren 46 mSV per year through cosmic radiation, are considered to be professional exposed persons (Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety [38]. Further occupational radiation exposures with ionizing radiation occur or occurred e.g. in the use of X-ray equipment for material testing, in welding work with thorium-containing welding electrodes or in technicians at the Bundeswehr bis ca. 1985 (NVA bis 1990), the radiological radiation radiation from radar equipment was exposed to radiation exposure, the incidence of radiation exposure to radiation is very high. Medical radiation exposure today is on the same scale as the natural radiation exposure of the population (approx. 2 mSv/year). Further data can not be found in Bundestag's case 18/5565 of 13.7.2015 (online available under Epidemiologically it is estimated at small radiation doses (<20 mSV, limit value for the effective dose for occupationally exposed persons) that the risk of mortality is increased by cancer. The mortality risk at a mean lung dose of 1 mSve/year is today estimated at less than 1 per 100,000. General air pollution / fine dust Older epidemiological studies from the USA, Poland and Germany show a rise of up to 1.5 times in the relative risk of lung cancer in regions with elevated air pollution concentrations [40]. Meanwhile, it is clear that this increase is mainly due to particulate air pollution in the atmosphere of particulates in the air are very heterogeneous, both in terms of their origin and their chemical composition. The main source of particulate matter with an a near-rodynamic frequency of 0.5 μm and 2 μm in the environment. In particular, diesel vehicles cause high emissions from fine and ultrafine (<0.1 μm) soot particles. On their large surface, organic substances are adsorbed, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The current knowledge of the relationship between mortality in adults and long-term exposure to fine dust is based on four American and two European cohort studies [42], [43],[44],.[45] The most important and most important is the study of the American Cancer Society, in which the risk factors and the time and cause of death of the cohort were linked to immission data from up to 156 agglomerations of the United States [45]. The cohort included over 500 000 adult men and women, the observation period from 1982 to 1998. For lung cancer mortality 7 risik kofakto oren 47 was the relative risk for PM2.5 statistically significantly increased. It increased by 14 % in relation to a change of 10 μg/m3 PM2.5. The International Cancer Research Agency (IARC, International Agency for Research on Cancer) of the World Health Organization's population in 2013 with exposure to human cancer is estimated to be associated with 22. This is estimated to mean that every year 223,000 people die from lung cancer as a result of air pollution, with half of these deaths being attributable to China and East Asia [46]. Diesel engine emissions (DME) There are extensive epidemiological studies on lung cancer in miners, truck drivers and bus drivers, railway workers and operators of heavy construction machines, which reveal clear evidence of a lung cancer risk also in humans [47]. Most of these studies - and their meta-analysis [48] show an increased lung cancer hazard. In June 2012, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified DME as \"carcinogenic in humans\" (Group 1) [49]. The decisive factor for tightening the previous classification (Group 2B, 1988) were epidemiological studies in DME-loaded working areas underground (Diesel Exhaust in Miners Studies, DEMS), in railway workers, and in truck drivers, as well as a large inter-occupational case-control study. The DME classification with \"sufficient evidence\" for particle cancer was not a time-consuming description of the presence of particles in the number of particles. Diesel soot consists of fine particles which comprise a high number of ultrafine particles. These particles can penetrate deep into the respiratory tract. They have a large surface area to which organic substances can be easily adsorbed. Most studies and all meta-analysis show an increased lung cancer risk in persons exposed to diesel gases on a professional basis. In these studies, the activity in occupations associated with exposure to diesel fumes was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, but as a measure of exposure only the occupational name and duration of the activity at work was available in most studies. Therefore, a quantification of the lung cancer hazard with regard to the concentration of diesel soot is not possible. Asbestos Under the trade name asbestos, various fibrous silicate minerals are grouped together. Relevant are above all chrysotile (white asbest), amosite (braunasbest) and crokydolite (blue as best). Asbestose fibre dust has a fibrogenic and locally tumor-producing effect. The IARC classed already 1973 asbestos as a human carcinogen has been observed as a [50] increase in the frequency of 1 microfibre and 5. As a result of the long latency period, an increase in the Asbestos-associated 7 risks of cofakto oren 48 lung carcinomas was observed only in 1975 with 15 cases. Thereafter, a rapid increase occurred. Since 1995 the carcinoma rate remained almost constant with approximately 700 cases per year. In Germany (BRD+DDR) the domestic consumption of raw asbestos increased sharply from 1948 to 1965 to approx. 244,000 tonnes per year and stagnated until about 1980. The substitution efforts at this point in time led to a decrease of the consumption curve to about 100,000 tonnes by 1989. In 1979, the use of spray asbestos was banned in Germany, from 1982 onwards successive use and subsequent production bans for other asbestos products were issued. With the dangerous substances regulations from 1990 and 1993 and the chemicals ban regulation from 1993 a continuous ban was implemented [52]. The cumulative exposure of asbestos fibre dust is calculated in fiber years, one fiber year corresponds to an 8-hour exposure over a year of 1 million asbestos fibres per m3 [53]. The cumulative exposure of asbestos fibre dust is calculated in fibre years, one fibre year corresponds to an eight-hour working-day effect over a year of 1 million asbestos fibres per m3 [53]. Hazard sources were mainly the asbestos textile industry (manufacturing of yarns, fabrics, ropes), the asbestos cement industry (production of plates, tubes, fittings), the construction industry (processing of asbestos cement products, asbestos-containing putty, spatula compounds, fire protection materials), the chemical industry (asbestos use as filler for paints and sealants, synthetic resin pressing compounds, thermoplastics, rubber tyres), the insulation industry (heat, sound and fire protection), the asbestos paper industry (Asbestos papers and cardboard) and the friction coating industry (best brake and clutch coverings) [53 ].

Artificial mineral fibres The group of artificial fibres, also known as Man Made Mineral Fibers (MMMF) in Anglo-Saxon language use, is heteromorphic, since a plethora of materials is used, e.g.: metals, glass or products of petrochemicals. Examples are: glass wool, stone wool and slag wool. As the synthetic fibres are increasingly used in vitro studies on isolated cells and animal studies, it became clear that these fibres may have an inflammatory effect and, depending on the exposure concentration, duration and place of exposure chosen, can also have a carcinogenic effect. An increased carcinogenic potential could be found in animal experiments after fiber injection into the peritonesum, but not after inhalation or intratracheal fibre application, 7 risks cofakto oren 49. The IARC classified special glass wool and ceramic fibres in 2b, the remaining artificial mineral fibres in 3 [54]. The MAK Commission assessed fibreglass and ceramic fibers as K2 substances (i.e. substances which are considered carcinogenic to humans), the others as substances in category 3b (that is, substances which give cause for concern because of possible carcinogenic effects in humans). This classification was carried out under preventive aspects. In the absence of positive epidemiological data in humans, it has no direct relevance to the occupational disease situation. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAK) Primarily, in the Federal Republic of Germany, only BK No. 4110 ‘Bösmal new formations of the airways by coking plant raw gases'. In 2009, scientific recommendations were made for two new occupational diseases: the legal definition of BK 4113 is ‘lung cancer by polycyclic aromatic compounds when a cumulative dose of at least 100 benzo(a)pyrene-years [(μg/m] of asbestos is made in the case of polychlorinated substances. \"Lung cancer due to the interaction of asbestos-fibre dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with the action of a cumulative dose, which corresponds to a probability of at least 50 per cent of the result of the installation 2. \"Kokereirohgase\" in the sense of BK 4110 is understood to mean both the technical product so called as well as air pollution, which becomes free when the furnaces are operated, in particular when the chambers are loaded and unloaded, but also because of chamber leaks on the furnace block. The cokingroh gase contain a number of carcinogenic substances. Of particular importance for malignant new formations of the airways and lungs are PAK mixtures. In the case of incomplete combustion of organic material, numerous polycyclic Aromatic hydrocarbons arise. The most well-known representative is the benzo(a)pyrene. There is an increased mortality on the lung carcinoma for workers in the production of carbon dioxide in the industry, the exposure to PAK-containing coal tar pitch is used in activities as roofers, asphalt workers, in the manufacture of black roofs, as for chimneys and for the manufactures of chimneys, and also in the extraction of the production in the chemical chemicals. Teare and pitch are used in the refractory industry for the manufacture of heat-resistant stones, in the iron-metallurgical industry as well as in the optical industry for lens production. Especially in the use of tar- or pitch-containing materials high exposures are observed today. The IARC graded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons for their human carcinogenicity between 1983 and 1985 a [55], [56],[57] and 7 Risik kofakto oren 50 confirmed the assessment in 2006: The lead substance benzo(a)pyrene was classified as K1-substance (i.e. safe human carcinogenic). Activities in coal gasification, coke production and coal tar distillation and processing and as chimney sweepers are accordingly considered to be carcinogenic due to exposure to benzo (a)pyrene. Many other polycyclic aroma hydrocarbons are classified in groups 2a to 3. Chromates In the literature, the carcinogenic effect of chromium VI compounds for carcinoma has been well documented in the production of chromium cancers in the lung. In the case of the first-time exposure to chromium cancer, the incidence of chromium was well reported in the manufacture in the lungs. In the case of chromate production, chromium-nickel-steel production, tanneries, chromiumat pigment production and welding, zinc-chromate compounds may be contained in yellow, orange and red colour pigments and corrosion-protective coatings and may be inhaled as aerosols when spraying. The MAK Commission has classified zinc chromat as carcinogenic in humans, further water-soluble 6-grade chromium compounds as carcinogenic to animals. In 1990 the IARC assessed all chromium-VI compounds as human carcinogenic to humans [57]. Silicon dioxide, crystalline The findings from studies in animals and humans led the IARRC to classify quartz as \"carcinogenic to humans\" [58]. Also, the Senate Commission has secured the testing of health-harmful working substances of the German research community in 1999 the carcinogenic effect of \"silicium dioxide, crystallized to be classified as \"criminal to humans\". In meta-analyses, the risk of lung cancer in the presence of silicosis increases by more than twofold for both non-smokers and smokers on average. Epidemiologically such excesses of lung disease have been observed for the ore mining, extraction and processing of natural stone, the ceramic industry, the silicate and clay industries, the processing and handling of silicate products and the foundry industry. The lung carcinoma by silicon dioxide is treated under occupational disease number 4112, \"lung cancer by the influence of crystalline silicon dioxide (SiO2) in the case of proven quartz dust disease (Silicose or Siliko tuberculosis). According to the primary scientific recommendation (BMA 2001) and according to the memorandum sheet (B MA 2002), coal miners are excluded from the occupational disease no. 4112. The medical expert at the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs has now established that there is no longer a medical association with the current condition of SGB VII. The medical-scientific findings required under § 9 SGB VII for the recognition of lung cancer in conjunction with silicosis in coal miners are now available. The reason for this is found in News/2015/Opinion-aerctic-specific advice on lung cancers in combination with silicosis in coalminers.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2 Arsen Arsen was already classified as human carcinogenic by IARC in 1973 [50], [59] also by the MAK Commission it was assessed as K1 substance (i.e. safe human carcinogenic). The inclusion of arsenic can be carried out both oral and inhaled. In the past there were exposures in viticulture, in the manufacture, packaging and application of arctic insecticides, in arsene extraction and in copper melting, in glass melting and by arsens containing components of antifouling inks. In addition, in uranium mining in the former GDR (Wismut AG) between 1946 and 1955, there were partially observed arse exposures to the metal processing and in the production of non-glass electro-alloys in the manufacturing of the compound. in zinc electrolysis, in the production and processing of glass and in the manufacture of NE metal alloys for the semiconductor industry, where the highest exposures were measured during crushing and mixing in the glass industry. Nickel, metallic and nickel compounds Increased nickel exposures occur mainly in welders, moreover in grinding and polishing, in galvanic surface coating, in mixing, compacting and plasma cutting in metal processing and in mechanical engineering as well as in mold repair in the Glass industry. In 1990, nickel and its compounds were classified by the International Agency of Research on Cancer (IARC) as human carcinogenic (Group 1) due to an increased lung cancer mortality in nickel refineries. Metallic nickel, on the other hand, is considered \"possibly carcinogenic\" (Group 2B). Since 2001, the carcinogenic effect has been attributed to the water-soluble nickel compounds. The MAK commission in 1972 graded metallic nickel and nickel in water-insoluble compounds – in the form of breathable dusts – as carcinogenic to humans. They are highly carcinogenic in animal experiments. Monochlorodimethylether has not yet been clearly carcinogenic, but technical monochlordimethyl ethers can be contaminated up to 7% with dichlorodi methyl ether. The incidence of lung carcinoma can be increased up to factor 8 in men exposed to dichlordiphenyl ethers or monochlorodiphenylethers [61], [62]. 7 Risik kofakto oren 52 Beryllium Beryllum is used as a construction material in aerospace, boat and vehicle construction and wherever components must be very light and exposed to high acceleration and centrifugal forces. It is also used as an alloy additive for copper and nickel. Exposures are mainly found in aircraft, space, electronics and nuclear industries. Increased death rates due to lung cancer have been observed in various retrospective studies among workers in beryllium production plants. For health monitoring of beryllium exposure and diagnostic procedure of beyllium-associated disease see also the corresponding S3 guideline under: Exposure.html. Tungsten and cobalt-containing carbide dusts Tungsten carbides are powder metallurgically produced materials that are characterized by their great wear resistance, temperature and corrosion resistance. They distinguish sintered carbides, welding alloys and injection powders based on carbide. Only minor importance is still attached to cast carbides today. sintering carbides consist predominantly of high-melting carbides of particularly suitable metals such as tungsten, titanium, tantalum, niobium, molybdenum, chromium and vanadium. As binders cobalt, rare nickel or iron are added. The production of sintery carbides runs over several stages. The IARC evaluated cobalt and tungsten carbide-containing hard metal dusts in 2006 are new and graded them into 2a. The following table (source [17]) contains a compilation of those noxes which are considered as triggers for lung carcinomas under German occupational disease law, each of which is subsumed under the corresponding occupational disease number.The list of typical occurrences of these agents is intended to provide guidance for the patient; the list is not exhaustive. 3.7 Risik Table Trigger Schad (Profession \"Siliko Kristal kofactore e 11: Zusam er für Lung licher Arb fsskrankhe otisches Nalinies Silizi © L mmen genk beitsen arbenk iumdi Leitlinistell karzinstoff numm karzin ioxid ienpro lung nome mer) nom\" ogram of Noxen, which according to German occupational diseases is a questionable subject to typical occurrence/remarking of the disease. Thus, this is the case of a substance of silicon dioxide, or a substance which is subject to a study of such a disease.

Consensual evidence-based Recommendation examined 2024 degrees Patients with lung carcinoma who are still smoking should be encouraged to stop smoking. They should be offered a qualified tobacco cessation. nce [67], [73],, [74],[75], (76], [...], [85], ...88],.[89] [90] Consensity Any measure that prevents the initiation of cigarette smoking or encourages the cessation of smoking in dependent smokers is a step towards the prevention of lung cancer. Policy measures of tobacco control such as tobacco tax, non-smoking workplace legislation and interventions at individual level to prevent the initiation or continuation of smoking are required, in particular the limitation of cigarette advertising, the reduction of children's access to cigarettes, the ban on smoking at the workplace. Active smoking and lung carcinoma The epidemiological relationship between active smoking and the associated lung cancer risk is presented in the chapter \"Epidemiology\". The number of cigarettes smoked daily and the duration of tobacco use are proportional to the risk of consecutive cancer; a threshold below which exposure could be riskless does not exist [66]. Consequently, all efforts to prevent active smoking must be directed to reduce in any way. The prognosis of manifest lung cancer is better the earlier before the manifestation of the disease of tobacco consumption was terminated. Thus, in a study of 543 patients with locally limited non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the 5-year survival rate was 50% for current smokers, 54% for ex-smoking patients for 1-8 years, 59% for ex smokers for 9-17 years and 76% for non-smokers [67]. Similar results are a retrospective longitudinal study of 1370 patients 4.2 Tabakrauc chen and lung cancer 64 with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Passive smoking and lung carcinoma As explained in the chapter \"Epidemiology\", passive smoking is now clearly recognised as an important risk factor for lung cancer. In a meta-analysis [69], passive smoking women's spouses found themselves at a 24% higher risk of developing lung cancer compared to non-exponed women. Passive use in the workplace is accompanied by a 22% risk increase for the development of lung carcinoma. According to calculations by the German Cancer Research Center, passive use in Germany leads to 263 new diseases of lung cancer [70] among non-smokers annually. Current international surveys show similar results [71], [66], (Evidenzgrad 1a) [72] (Evidencegrad 1b]. Quitting smoking after diagnosis Pulmonary carcinome Patients with pulmonary carcinomas are often motivated to stop tobacco consumption [73]. Nevertheless, about 50% of patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer continue to smoke [73 ] [74] (evidence grade 2b). A successful cessation of tobacco with pharmacological support is also possible in the case of renal disease (equalification of pulmonary cancer). Also known for continued passive smoking exposure after diagnosis of lung carcinoma is an adverse effect [67], [75] (Evidence level 2b). Stopping smoking prior to surgical therapy In a retrospective analysis in 261 patients who performed pneumonectomy in lung carcinoma, only the time at which smoking was discontinued proved to be predictor of severe pulmonary complications. Patients who were still smoking within 4 weeks of surgery had a significantly increased risk of serious pulmonary complication to die [76] (evidence level 2a). In a metaanalysis of patients with predominantly orthopaedic and general surgery, the preoperative smoke stop was associated with reduced postoperative complications at least 1 month before surgery [77] (evidence grade 1a). Often, no current incidence of chemotherapy was observed in patients prior to diagnosis and definitive surgical therapy for several weeks, e.g. through staging examinations. In this period, numerous contacts between patients and physicians were observed to be observed prior to the diagnosis of the new lung cell. Before chemotherapy There was no difference between current and previous smokers [68] in a retrospective study of 1370 patients with newly diagnosed, advanced, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). In another retrospective longitudinal study in patients with new diagnosed NSCLC, smoking was associated with better performance status after 12 months in a multivariant analysis [78]. A significant difference in survival was not described. These studies countered a series of studies that showed an independent risk factor for mortality in smokestop patients. In a 2 taba akraucchen and lung cancer 65 retrospective longitudinal examination in 1155 patients with NSClc, the current smoke status was an independent hazard factor for death [79], in addition to age, socioeconomic data and alcohol consumption of smoking. Also, in patients who had advanced NSCLD, a significant relationship between smoking habits and prognosis [80] was observed in patients treated with CYPLC. The induction of hepatic metabolism of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 by tobacco smoke is due here. The increased concentrations of carbon monoxide in smokers can lead to tissue hypoxie and thus impair the effectiveness of chemotherapy [82], [74]. Ingredients of tobacco smoke interact with various receptors, such as the nicotine gene acetylcholine receptor, which favours chemoresistence [83]. In addition, nicotin in human cells suppresses chemotherapy-induced apoptosis [83 ]. Stopping smoking from radiotherapy/radiochemotherapy In patients with NSCLC in stage I and II, who undergo radiotherapy, tobacco smoking was an independent predictor of mortality [84]. For patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in stage limited disease who were treated with radiochemo therapy, tobacco smoke had been shown to be an independent predicator of mortality[85]. During radiation exposure, 2b was studied in one long-term study in one of these infections. In addition to the performance status and lung function, smoking status was a predictor of the occurrence of radiopharmaceutical pneumonia [87]. Development of second carcinoma Smoking is an independent risk factor for the development of secondary carcinomas also in the lungs [88], [89] (evidence level 2b). In patients with SCLC, for example, the relative risk of second cancer was three times higher two years after the end of initial therapy for smokers than for those who ended tobacco use [90] (Evidence level 2B). Summary: The termination of tobacco smoking in patients with lung cancer shows positive effects, especially on postoperative complications and the occurrenceof secondary tumours (evidentity level 2 b). 4.3 Occupation EClliche exposure and lung cancer 66 Occupational exposure and pulmonary cancer Consensual statement 2010 Compliance with statutory occupational safety regulations and regulations ensures that there is a continuous risk assessment of the risks of exposure and exposure to lung cancer. In general, occupational activity can lead to exposure to each of these noxes. In Germany, occupational safety and thus the prevention and minimization of all hazards are regulated by law (Arbeitsicherheitsgesetz 1973, Arbeitsschutzgesetz 1995). The Dangerstoffverordnung explicitly refers to carcinogenic substances and lays down in Annex IV production and use bans for certain substances, preparations and products that have carcinogenic or mutagenic properties. In Austria, similar regulations exist. According to the scientific findings on the carcinogenic effects of agents, hazardous substances are regularly evaluated and classified by various organisations (e.g. DFG and IARC). The determination of health-related limit values for carcinogenic substances is not possible, since according to the findings to date on the pathomechanics of carcinogenesis, even in the low-dose range, at least a linear dose-effect relationship must be assumed, so that the risk with decreasing exposure levels is reduced, then epidemiologically no longer detectable. In addition, the employer's obligation to assess the workplaces in relation to their hazards is also reflected in the regulation on hazardous substances. For activities involving carcinogenic substances, the following requirements are made: • It is necessary to aim for substitution of the substance by a less dangerous one. • If this is technically impossible, processing in the closed system should be carried out. • Compliance with workplace limits must be ensured. • When this cannot be guaranteed, further technical and personal protective measures are necessary. The problem of the assessment of newly developed agents is attempted by the European Community with the so-called REACH regulation, which regulates the registration, evaluation, approval and restriction of chemical substances. The 3 occupational exposure and lung cancer 67 responsibility for compliance with this regulation lies with manufacturers and importers. Basically, despite the improved legal regulations, a grey zone or latencies between the use of new agents and definitive risk assessment will remain. As an example of the use for new agents whose risk assessment is not yet completed, the nano particles are only mentioned by Germany. In spite of the improved statutory regulations, the legislators, manufacturers and employers will be able to avoid persistent errors and delays in the prevention of primary asbestos. The success of these late-introduced prevention measures will only be demonstrated by a steady decline in the number of lung carcinomas due to the long latency periods of about 30 years from around 2020.A decrease in cases recognised as occupational disease could already be detected in 2015 (2013: 793; 2014: 832; 2015: 771) (source: Secondary prevention in occupational medicine is regulated in relation to cancer diseases, especially by life-long follow-up (after exposure) occupational medical screenings. These are organised by ZeBWis (Central Care Unit Wismut) for workers working in the uranium mining industry, by ZAs (Central Monitoring Centre for asbestos-hazardous workers) for asbestos exposed workers and by ODIN (Organisation Service for Follow-up Investigations) for all other cancer-caking agents. 4.4 Radiation u Recommendationg A Level of Evidence Level of Eviden 2a and Dieselruß Radiation and DieselRuß Evidence-based Recommendation 2010 grad In order to reduce lung cancer risk by radon, exposure to radiation exposure must be reduced in the case of use of radiation.",

      "text": "Consensus Evidence-based Statement 2010 nce The lung cancer risk from air pollutants can most effectively be reduced by reducing the emission of diesel soot. Consensual epidemiological studies (Hiroshima and Nagasaki, occupational and medical exposures) have clearly demonstrated in the dose range above 100 mSv, ionic radiation increases the cancer risk. This additional cancer risk, as well as the genetic risk generated by ionizing radiation, is called stochastic radiation effect. According to the current state of knowledge [91], it is also assumed that the cancer hazard increases linearly, ohn lower threshold dose, with the dose (so-called linear-non-threshold hypothesis). Based on the linear-non-threnhold hypothesis, the epidemiological studies have proven that the lung is one of the relatively highly radiation sensitive organs. A detailed description of the correlations can be found in the chapter \"Epidemiology\". Based on linear-Non-Thres Hold-Hypothesis, the top radiation principle is the so-called \"ALARA-A-Resive Principle\" (A must hold no radiation exposure). The highest radiation protection principle is the so-called \"ALARA principle\" (As Low As Reasonable Achievable), i.e. the goal of keeping all radiation exposure as low as reasonably attainable. Based on this, the three radiation protection principles apply in German radiation protection law (X-ray and radiation protection regulations): • Justification, • Avoidance (optimization) and • Limit values (only for occupational radiation exposed) that e s ne ese). eise 4 Strahlung u und Dieselruß 69 Any radiation exposure must be as small as reasonably accessible (minimization). For the population and occupationally exposed radiation, dose limits apply when using civilising radiation sources. These limit values for the effective dose ensure that, in compliance with these limits, only risks (additional risk of mortality) occur in the amount acceptable to the affected persons (increased by the amount of radiation exposure) are considered as low in terms of medical radiation exposure (radiary therapy, X-ray diagnostics). This means that in rooms with higher levels of radioactivity (e.g. radon) or in radiation protection areas only as long as absolutely necessary is kept, or patients are subjected to radiological examination only under strict professional indications. • the distance to the radiation source is chosen as large as possible. The distance quadrat law is one of the most effective protection possibilities for occupationally exposed persons. If, for example, a doctor steps back from the patient to be examined during an X-ray examination (from approx.30 cm to 1 m) the dose is already reduced by the factor 10. • Shielding is to be used. For X-Ray radiation, for instance, a lead apron can reduce the dose depending on the radiation quality between a factor 10 and 100. Constructional and technical radiation protection measures are to be planned. The radiation risk is strongly dependent on the age of exposure. For this reason, special protective precautions are permitted for the unborn child. Even in children and adolescents, the most stringent standards for protection are to apply. Thus, children in the mother's womb are still exposed to radiation from radiation and radiation from radionutrilogy. As a consequence of radiation protection today, with the exception of the approved, quality-assured mammography screening, no series studies with X-rays or \"routine examinations\" are permitted. Medicine and especially X-Radio Diagnostics in the statistical average with approx. 2 mSv/year causes an additional radiation dose for approximately equal natural radiation exposure. All attempts to reduce this medical exposure in Germany have been unsuccessful so far, with especially the justification of a radiological examination the greatest savings potential. In recent years the medical radiation exposure has increased due to the strongly increasing use of CT investigations [93]. The scientific advisory committee of the Federal Environment Ministry, the Radiation Protection Commission, with its opinion of 12 May 2005 after evaluation of all available health studies on radon, has determined that from the range of 100 to 200 Bq/m3 a statistically significant increase in the lung cancer rate by radon is given.",

In the case of higher radon concentrations, structural measures such as the removal of leaky sites, the sealing of basement floors or the sealing off of walls are recommended. In areas with increased radon levels in the ground, the actual indoor load should be determined and remediation measures adapted to the state of the building should be taken. In new buildings, the corresponding construction measures should be planned from the outset. The Federal Environment Ministry offers assistance in the rehabilitation of radon-affected dwellings. For this purpose, the Ministry has established note sheets for the renovation of radone-affiliated houses, which are sent free of charge. In case of professional activities in the environment of natural radiation sources (cosmic, terrestrial radiation, natural radioactive substances) the radiation exposure of persons must be radiologically controlled. Here, in a hierarchy organized by the person responsible for radiation protection and personified [92]. Private lifestyle and nutrition Evidence-based recommendation 2010 grade diet, rich in fruits, fresh vegetables and tomatoes, reduces the risk of lung cancer and is therefore recommended. 2010: Degree of recommendation C (weak recommendation) nce [14], [97],[98], (99], [...], [101], (‘102'), [104], ‘105', ‘106', [107] Consensus Physical activity, compared to sedentary activity, leads to a reduction in lung cancer risk, also taking into account cigarette smoking [94], Similarly, a diet rich in fruit and vegetables has a protective effect [13], '97, '98, '99, '100', '101'. In a major European study as well as a summary analysis of 7 cohorts, a strong protective effect has been exclusively [102] or 'preferably' the intake of fruits and less of food ingredients, which have been analysed as a result of the presence of anti-cancerium. the oxidative DNA damage of the cell and therefore reduce the risk of cancer 5 Priva ate life and nutrition Individual food components were grouped into classes or also analysed individually. This showed a reduced risk for tomatoes [105], [106],[107] and cross-flowered plants (vegetables such as white cabbage, red cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, mustard cabbage, kohlrabi, but also radishes, rapeseed, mustache, horseradish and cress) [100], [10], while increased selenium levels with blood and in toenails were shown to have a protective effect [108]. Several studies, both of which documented food intake and even blood concentrations, showed no positive association by questionnaires. They have led to the large chemoprevention studies, but they have been largely negative or in some cases even had a harmful effect (see below). Cohort studies also tended to point to a protective effect of a variety of carotenoids [97], [105],[115] and an antioxidant index [112]. However, the combination of data from 7 such studies has not shown a highly protective association for any of the carotinoids other than β-cryptoxanthin [111]. The data for vitamin C is suggestive of a positive effect, while for vitamin A no statements could be made [116]. On the other hand, increased serum levels of vitamin B6 were associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer, whereas folates or vitamin B12 were not [117]. In recent years, more plant-chemical agents such as flavono and isothiozyanates were investigated. These low-molecular substances were formed by plants and have either a potent antioxidative activity (FDuthionoids) or transfer in phase. In the case of alcohol consumption1 the incidence of alcohol use2is associated with alcohol consumption2is related to alcohol consumption.In the caseof alcohol consumption, however, it appears that alcohol consumption is more likely to be associated with the presence of alcohol. In the case of alcohol consumption, beer appears to have a more negative influence, while wine consumption is more likely to be associated with a reduction in the risk of lung cancer [127]. The effect of alcohol use on the risk for lung cancer is epidemiologically difficult to delimit from a frequently accompanying cigarette consumption, which may be responsible for this association.",

With the recent publications of several large randomized-controlled studies on lung cancer early detection using low-dose computer tomography, data are now available that can justify a positive recommendation for establishing a lung cancer premature detection program in the benefit of risk assessment. X-ray thorax overview Evidence-based recommendation examined 2024 degrees In case of asymptomatic risk persons for lung cancer, early detection should not be performed by means of chest overview images alone or in combination with cytological sputum examinations. nce [140] Strong consensus studies on early detection of lung cancer in patients with imaging procedures were first performed using X-Raythorax coverage images in the 70s of the century. U.S. PLCO study (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial) was among them the largest randomized-controlled study with 154,93 participants. Smokers and non-smokers aged 55-74 were included. Mortality data were published in 2011 [146] and were included in a Cochrane review [140] with data from eight further studies (with a total of 453,965 subjects). Annual X-ray thor surveys over 4 years and a follow-up of 13 years did not result in a reduction in lung carcinoma mortality in standard care (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07) in the PLCO trial. Metaanalysis and comparison of various intensive screening concepts showed that statistis did not significantly increase lung cancer mortality by 11% (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1 to 1.23) in intensive screening by means of X-Rthorax diagrams in the baseline of 20.

These early, non-randomised, CT studies showed that early cancers can be detected by CT screening. Subsequently, randomised-controlled studies were initiated in Europe and the USA, which examined the effect of e CT screening on lung cancer mortality in the primary endpoint. With the publication of the results of the European NELSON study in 2020, data from (all) 8 randomised studies on low-dose CT screening with lung cancer-related mortality results (see tab below) are now available. While the early European studies (DANTE, DLST, ITALUNG, MILD) were not sufficiently powerful to show a significant reduction in lung cancer related mortality by CT screening, this was the first time published in the major US study, the National Lung Screeni Trial (NLST) with the comparison of annual screening using low-dose CT vs. conventional X-ray thorax analysis, which was very intensely discussed in the context of the clinical trials1. In particular, the high rate of false positive findings and the high complication rate in the clarification of these findings contributed to the concerns. This assessment was also reflected in the reticent \"can\" recommendation on CT screening for lung cancer published in the (last) version of this guideline in 2018. Both the large Dutch-Belgian NELSON study as well as the significantly smaller German LUSI study and the 10-year post-evaluation of the Italian MILD study were able to confirm the positive results of NLST and also show a significant reduction in lung cancer-related mortality by means of CT screening. Two recent meta-analysis of Hunger et al. and Passiglia et al calculated on the basis of the 8 randomized controlled studies, including 87,876 subjects at risk (LDCT vs. 0,7 LSTANT, 0,8LTSTANT). In Germany, the initial screening round of 5 British pilot centres showed a lung cancer prevalence of 2.2% (250/11) and a randomised incidence of 8. In view of the intended establishment of a national lung cancer screening programme in Germany, a reassessment of the data situation was pending. In October 2020, the first decisive step was to present the evidence assessment carried out on behalf of the G-BA by the Institute for Quality and Economy in Health Care (IQWIG). In its final report, the IQWig identified no benefit of low-dose CT screening as compared to any screening and thus that for (former) strong smokers the benefits of low dose CT lung cancer screening outweigh the damage [149]. The independent scientific assessment by the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS) pursuant to § 84(3) Radiation Protection Act was submitted to the specialist societies for comment in April 2021 and published in September 2021 together with a replica of the BfS to the opinions of the affected specialist circles [156]. This finding states: \"The balancing of benefits and risk shows that lung cancer early detection by means of LDCT reduces lung cancer mortality in smokers, but also with radiation risks and adverse effects are associated with pulmonary disease.",

However, this is still pending at the present time (February 2022). Furthermore, the G-BA is currently setting the framework conditions for a national lung carcinoma early detection program in consultation with the BFS and the specialist societies. This applies in particular to the following key points: • Definition of the inclusion and addressing of the risk population to be investigated • Obligation to provide an accompanying smoking cessation • CT technique and structural conditions • Algorithm of clarification/round-them management • Integration into a qualified interdisciplinary supply structure • Additional evaluation/benefit • Documentation and quality assurance In view of the current process of national and European consensus formation, we are currently limiting ourselves in this chapter to the tabular list of relevant studies as well as to a general recommendation and refer to future updates in line with further developments.

Strong consensus background Sputumacytology The major studies on sputum cytology in the 1970s and 1980s examined mainly the role of sputume cytology in conjunction with conventional X-ray thorax screening and the independent contribution of sputumzytology to screening (Mayo Lung Project: [141], [171]; [172] Johns Hopkins Project:[173],[174],] [175], (176] Memorial Sloan-Kindering Center Project): [143] These studies were moreover not sufficiently \"powerful\" in order to determine the extent to which Sputrumology could be administered by means of an induction. Also in a metaanalysis of study data (Cochrane Review) there was no evidence for a survival advantage by screening by means of sputum cytology [140] (Evidence level 1a). Further improvements in sputume diagnostics could be achieved in the meantime e.g. with computer-assisted cytometric image analysis [178], [179],[180],.[181] and molecular biological methods [182], <183],<184], >185],>186], ≤187], ≥189], about [190], around [191], above all in combination with low-dose CT and fluorescence bronchoscopy [195]. Also, there is an effort on new strategies for further diagnostic clarification of patients with positive findings in sputum screening [196], partly in combination of low- dose CT and fluoroescence bronchoscopy [197]. In case of clinical suspicion of a lung carcinoma or in case of suspicious findings in the non-invasive methods, a bronchoscopy is usually performed. Classic white light bronchoscopy detects well-manifest endobronchial tumours, but may overlook early changes in the mucous membrane level (dysplasia, carcinomas in situ, early invasive carcinom). Thus, the sensitivity of the white light bronchooscopy is not optimal for the \"early carcinomy\". The 2 sputu umcyt tology/ endoscopic procedure/ tumor marker 79 discovery of earlier neoplastic lesions can not be improved significantly due to technical new developments such as autofluorescence bronchoscopy or the so-called \"narrow-band imaging\" [198]. Due to the invasivity of the bronchocoscopy, it is not suitable for early diagnosis of asymptomatic risk collectives. Recommendations for the use of bronchoma in the context of the primary cancer diagnosis of the tumor. SCC, CEA, NSE, CYFRA 21–1, M2-PK) are still indiscriminate in 647 patients, 200 of whom had lung cancer, a fuzzy logic analysis. The sensitivity of the tumour markers mentioned for tumour stages I and II ranged from 20 to 30%, at a maximum of 67%. Using Fuzzy Logik analysis, sensitivity (with an underlying specificity of 95%) increased to 75%. The positive predictive value was thus 87%, the negative predictive level of 89%. If, under analogue boundary conditions, one assumes a realistic screening group, in which the point prevalence of a lung carcinoma is realistically no more than 2%, then the sensitivity of 75% is the underlying sensitivity of 75 % and a specificity 95 % of the positive predictative value is only at 23%, and the negative predicative value of 99%. Since a positive predictable value of 23 % for a large-scale screening alone is likely to trigger a large number of cases of B-diagnosis. It could prove its importance in combination with other screening methods. Furthermore, molecular biological and genetic procedures in peripheral blood are developed. These include, among many other methods, analyses of circulating tumour cells [201], [202], (203] and cell-free DNA [204] in the blood, but also analyses from the exate air [205] and urine [206]. For none of these new methods has been shown to be a survival advantage in the use of early detection of lung carcinoma, so that they can not be recommended for routine use. 6.1 Klinis Table Sympt Husten Gwic Luftno Brutsc Hämo Knoch Finger Fever Schwä Source: sche Presentation 80 Diagnostics Clinical presentation Symptoms According to the overview of Spiro et al. from 2007, around 90% of patients with lung carcinoma already show initial disease symptoms [207]. New retrospective observation studies from Spain (9,876 lung cancer patients; period 2016) and China (7.1 lung cancer; period 2005. Symptoms increase with higher lung cancer stages, as shown in the Spanish observational study (stage I symptoms 40.7%, stage II symptoms 57.5%, stage 69.8% and stage IV symptoms 72.3%). The following symptoms and clinical signs appear initially in lung cancer (Table 9): e 13: Frequency of initial symptoms in lung carcinoma (modified according to Spiro et al., tom or clinical sign Frequency n 8-75% loss of fast 0-68% ot 3-60% chmerzen 20-49% optyse 6-35% hen pain 6-25% rndpartial changes (clubbing) 0-20% r 0-20% achfeeling 0-10% Based on the overview of Spiro and al. approximately one third of the symptoms are caused by the primary tumor. In another third of cases there are systemic symptoms such as anorexia, weight loss or weakness (asthenia), and in again one-third of the diseases there are specific symptoms for a defined metastasis]. They are caused on the one hand by the relatively late presentation of the patient to his family doctor/practical physician, on the other hand by a delayed referral to the specialist for lung tumor diseases or to the lung physician [211]. The timings and intervals from the first symptom to the beginning of treatment were well defined in the Aarhus Statement Paper [93]. At the same time, varying guidance values for maximum waiting times for lung cancer treatment were given in different countries [211]. Currently, however, no evidence-based recommendations at maximum waiting intervals can be given symptoms of the primary tumor Central lung carcinomas more frequently than peripheral tumors lead to clinical symptoms. Coughing (also a changing cough character of the COPD patient with known chronic cough) is the most frequently observed symptom, followed by dyspnea, chest pain and haemoptyses or exectoration of a bloodly aged sputum. Other manifestations such as Vena-cava-superior syndrome Dysphagia or stridorosis are more rare in the case of cancerous disease and cancer. the thoracic organs in >40-year-old patients with COPD and a smoker's history should be an occasion to examine the indication for further diagnostics such as CT-thorax or bronchoscopy [212]. Symptoms and clinical signs of intrahoracal tumour spread As a result of direct tumour spread or lymph node infestation, various symptoms may occur due to the involvement of nervous structures, chest wall, vascular structures or visceral organs such as oesophagus. In addition, e.g. the hoarseness (left-side vocal band paresis in the infiltration of the N. recurrens) lesion of the plexus brachialis (tumor above the sulcus superior, pancoast tumo the horner syndrome (infestation of the ganglion stellatum) and the vena-cava-superior syndrome (upper influent accumulation). The symptoms of extrathoracic tumour spread In approximately one third of patients, symptoms are associated with extrathora metastases. The predilection organs of metastasis are the bones (especially the axe skeleton and proximal parts of the long tube bones), liver, adrenal glands and intraabdominal lymph nodes, brain unaxillary, supraclavikular and cervical lymph node. Common symptoms are pain (e.g. due to bone infestation), weakness, weight loss, icterus (liver infestations), headache, nausea, focal neurologic manifestations, seizures, confusion (CNS infested).

In the diagnosis of lung cancer, mainly three methods are used, which work with ionising radiation: thoracic coverage, computer tomography (CT) and positron emission tomographic (PET), the latter mainly in combination with the CT in one device (P ET/CT). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and thorax sonography take place without ionizing radiation; these methods are established in the diagnosis and staging of lung carcinoma for specific issues (e.g. brain metastases, sulcus superior tumors, assessment of a possible infiltration of breast wall or mediastinum). Thorax overview recording The overview of two levels is the most commonly used, initial radiological procedure for chest disease. Thus, lung cancers are either determined as symptoms or as asymptomatic random finding. Peripheral lung cancer is recommended as a direct indication of the central pulmonary cancer. In case of systematic literature research, 2 systematic overviews of the sensitivity of the chest overview ([220]) as well as the diagnostic accuracy of the thorax overview (in comparison with digital tomosynthesis ([221]) and a randomised controlled study (RCT) were identified for the feasibility of a timely X-ray examination of the Thorax organs ([222]). Both systematic survey work was evaluated with evidence level 2a and RCT with evidence levels 1b. For the detection of a symptomatic lung carcinoma, a sensitivity of 77-80% was reported in the literature ([210]).Both survey work concluded that due to the limited sensitivity of thoracology overview (continuation of a negative finding and clinical suspicion of a lung cancer, especially in patients with a high risk of lung cancer should be performed further diagnosis. X-ray contrast agents (European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) 2018) are intended to perform a CT of thorax and upper abdomen with an intravenous contrast medium. The upper abdominal organs, in particular the liver, are to be completely mapped. The start delay for CT after the contrast medium injection is to be chosen in such a way that the upper abdomen is represented in the portalvenous contrast medium phase (about 70 seconds), an additional arterial phase is not necessary for the staging of the lung carcinoma. For a sufficient assessment of the spread, especially the infiltration into neighbouring anatomical structures, a layer thickness of up to 2 mm is required; 5 mm layers, even if available in all three spatial orientations (axial, coronar, sagittal) are insufficient. For the detection of a lung cancer, the CT represents the most sensitive radiological procedure. In the lung parenchyme, a lung carcinoma can precede it; an obvious infiltration of neighboring structures or the detection of metastases are highly suggestive for a malignant tumor. The spectrum CTmorphological appearance of lung carcinoma is broad and ranges from the typical spiculated round herd to smoothly limited round flocks or room demands to infiltrative processes, which are hardly radiologically distinguishable from pneumonia. Since the CT provides accurate information about the location of relevant findings (e.g. pulmonary herds, enlarged lymph nodes), it should always be performed before invasive measures, especially before bronchoscopy or mediastinoscopy. Also, bronchoscopic procedures may cause artifacts in CT, such as focal pulmonary hemorrhages due to biopsies, which affect the diagnostic significance of CT. Therefore, a CT should not be performed immediately following a bronchoscopy. The low dose CT is not a rule-reduction of high frequency exposure. For this reason, the application of intravenous contrast agent is usually not indicated. In a normal habitus of the patient, a low dose CT should not exceed an effective radiation dose of 1.3 mSv. To achieve this, very detailed protocol recommendations have been published that take into account a wide range of installed CT device types (Nagel H.D. et al. 2017). A high priority is the low doseCT in programs for the early detection of lung cancer as well as in the (volumetric) progression control of inherently detected pulmonary round herds. As with the staging of lung carcinoma, a small layer thickness is required in the low-dose CT, ideally isotropic Voxel in case of a reconstructed layer thickness of less than 1.5 mm. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRT) MRT is mainly used for the detection or exclusion of brain metastases and for the imaging of local tumor cancers in the context of the CT. In addition, MRI contributes to the differential diagnosis of focal liver lesions and adrenal lesions. MRI sequences without and with contrast agents are required for the examination of the brain skull in the context of lung carcinoma staging unless there is a contraindication against the intravenous application of MR contrast agents. Appropriate investigation protocols for the MRI of the thorax regarding the question of infiltration of the upper thoracic aperture, mediastinal or thoral spine by lung cancer were published in 2012 ([223]; [224];[225]). A dynamic MRI during continued breathing provides significantly better insights into the presence of a mediastinum or thorax wall than the CT in respiratory breast arrest. Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluoro-18 fluorodesoxyglucose (FDG) PET is a non-invasive nuclear medical imaging method for the quantitative measurement of the onthocardioidal function and of the metabolites. In oncology, PET uses the increased tumour metabolism and other specific pathophysiological principles for whole body diagnostics. Due to the strongly increased glucose metabolism (measured as \"Standardized Uptake Value\", SUV) of most solid tumors as well as lymphomas, in clinical practice, glucose analogue 2-F-18-Fluoro-2-D-glucose (F-18 FDG) is almost exclusively used. However, a moderately to significantly increased glucose metabolism can also be detected in acute inflammatory processes (e.g. florid tuberculosis or sarcoidosis). PET full-ring scanners today represent the standard with the best possible image quality. A further technical development is the integrated PET/CT, whereby the advantages of PET (high sensitivity) and CT (very good morphological resolution and anatomical detail representation) are linked to the patient with lung carcinoma. Thoraxsonography With the transthoracic ultrasound (TTUS) a simple and everywhere applicable procedure is available. The TTUS is superior to the X-ray overview in the recognition of a pleural infiltration ([229]; [230]). To localize a pleura effusion it should be used before an effluent puncture ([231; [232]). In order to clarify a possible chest wall infiltration a TTUS can be performed in addition to the staging CT, alternatively an MRI ([333]). For breast-walled tumors there is the possibility of a TTUS-controlled puncture. The diagnostic yield and the complication rate correspond to the CT-controlled Puncture (.[234];[235]). Pulmonary Perfusion Scintigraphy The quantitative lung perfusion scintigraphy provides the regional proportion of the perfusion of the portion of the punctured or to be irradiated together with the 3 imaging g and diagnostic assurance 89 total perfusion. These data are the basis for the calculation of the expected postoperative lung diagnosis function. Bone scintigraphy In the systematic metaanalysis of Silvestri, the diagnostic test parameters of skeletal scinTigraphy were collected [236]. Data from a total of eight studies in 723 patients showed cumulative sensitivity of 82% (95% CI: 57-94%) and specificity of 62% (95%) in bone metastases prevalence of 20% on average. The negative predictive value was 90%, and the positive predictive figure was 32%. Therefore, skeleal scin tigraphy is suitable to exclude bone metastatics with an unobtrusive finding at reasonable residual risk. In contrast, positive bone scinstigraphy requires further clarification. False positive findings of bone scintimigraphy are a significant practical problem due to the frequency of degenerative and traumatic changes and the difficulty of achieving definitive clarification by means of biopsy or imaging. Likewise, false positive findings in bone cancer imaging are a major practical problem, as a result of the incidence of degenerational and traumatoidal alterations, as well as to achieve a positive diagnosis of a radiation dose of up to 2. In contrast, the thorax CT has an approximately two hundred times higher radiation dose at 4 to 7 mSv (Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS) 2019). For the combined positron emission tomography/computer tomograph (PET-CT) radiation doses of 12 to 15 mSV are indicated in the diagnosis of lung cancer, with about half of which is attributable to the applied radioactive pharmacon and the other half is caused by the X-ray radiation of the integrated CT (Radioprotection Commission (SSK) 2005). In comparison, the annual natural radiation exposure in Germany is 2.1 mSb, in a trans-Atlantic flight passengers are exposed to an additional radiation dose of 0.03 – 0.08 mSc (Federal Radiation Protection Office (B fS) generally due to the scientific evidence that with the level of a medical radiation exposure the risk of a radiation induced malignant tumor is directly proportionally increased in adults. 100 mSv with uncertainties is discouraged by the International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) from calculating the theoretical number of additional cancer cases due to very low radiation doses (International Commission on Radiological Protection ( ICRP) 2007).

In a prospective randomized study, a preoperative FDG PET could reduce the rate of useless (futile) operations by half in non-small cell patients, mainly because of the more accurate mediastinal lymph node staging and the evidence of unexpected distant metastasis. Another prospective randomised study found a significantly lower frequency of mediastinoscopy performed in patients who received an FDG PET in addition to conventional staging ([246]). Internationally, in guidelines for the staging of non-little cell lung carcinoma, a FDGPET/CT is recommended for at least curative therapy intension in the American College of Radiology (ACR) (American College of Radiation 2018) and the NICE (National and NCE) in English.

Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer could not be demonstrated during a two-year follow-up period when using PET/CT in post-care compared to CT with contrast agents ([247]). Evidence-based recommendation tested 2024 degrees In case of detected small cell lung carcinoma, an FDG-PET/CT should be used to determine the tumour stage, including the detection of remote metastases, if an M1 stage (extensive disease) has not been previously secured. nce [248], [249] Strong consensus-based Recommendation examined 2024 In the case of detectable small cell pulmonary carcinomas in the M-1 stage (Extensive Disease). 6.3 Imageg EK g and diagnostic assurance 93 Consensus-based recommendations 2024 *CAVE: The PET study is not evaluated in this indication of further remote metastatics, even if individual remote metasases have been secured previously. These were evaluated with evidence level 1a and 2a. Both metaanalyses have different results. An analysis from 2016 with 7 included studies (total 408 patients) found little evidence for the benefit of PET/CT in small cell lung cancer, only in the detection of bone metastases the PET/ CT proved to be superior to skeletal scintigraphy ([248]). However, a recent analysis of 2019 with 9 included studies and a total of 721 patients found a change in the stage (limited vs. extensive disease) in 15% of cases without, however, being able to identify an advantage for survival [249]. Nevertheless, despite this, the use of PET-CT (American College of Radiology 2018; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in both an American and an English guideline, is considered in a study of a sulcus-superior-tumor. [MRI] is an excellent example of tumour infiltration to the mediastinal, spinal and thorax wall. Clinical studies on the diagnostic accuracy of these two methods for assessing the local spread of lung carcinoma have not been found in systematic literature research. 6.3 Bildg EC and diagnostic assurance 94 Consensus-based recommendation tested 2024 In a proven well differentiated, neuroendocrine tumor of the lung, a nuclear-medical somatostatin receptor diagnosis can be used to clarify treatment options. Strong consensus neuroenocrine tumours with good differentiation, especially carcinoids, express somatostatic receptors. These properties are not suitable for the diagnosis of the incidence of abtinosis with radioactive somatoblastine receptor diagnosis. Large prospective studies are not expected due to the low incidence of bronchus carcinoids. Primary tumours were scintigraphic in 71-100% of cases. In a series of 89 patients, Yellin et al. showed that somatostatin receptor scinTIgraphy with a sensitivity of 90 % and specificity of 89% tumor manifestations including mediastinal lymph node metastases and extrathoracic metastasis [252]. The method of investigation is suitable for relapse diagnosis and in a study in 31 patients with relapse thought to be present in 26% of cases previously unknown tumor herds ([251]). Recently, somatostatic receptor ligands such as Ga-68-DOTOC have been identified with positron beam-labelled somatostatin receptor ligades such as T253 or DOTOC outside studies for PET diagnosis, which exhibit lower radiation exposure and can be expected to be improved on the basis of the measurement of PET technology.[253]. Signs, such as contact with the aorta <90° of circumference, missing contact to the mediastinum or <3 cm, can be safely collected in the CT. They give a technical reectability in 97%; if these signs are missing, an inoperability is to be expected in 50% ([255]). This can possibly mean a test thoracotomy for the patient. The situation in the tumor relationship to the thorax wall with a sensitivity between 38-87% and a specificity between 40-90% [255 ] is comparable. As the underlying studies mainly originate from the 80s and 90s, better results can be expected when transmitted to the current radiological examination technique. Another factor that results from an inoperative T4 situation is a pleura or pericardium carcinosis. Corresponding discharges are sensitively detected by radiological cross-section methods. A pleural effusion is usually malignant in this setting. An additional dilution of the pleura to the CT is achieved in addition to the predisposition, however, in the case of a predistinct. At least if there is a corresponding digital diagnosis ([255]). 6.3 Bildg EK EK g and diagnostic assurance 95 The PET/CT is particularly suitable for the assessment of the primary tumor of existing pulmonary herds. It is therefore suitable for distinguishing between further pulmonary tumour manifestations and insecure benign round flocks. Systematic metaanalyses, partly with quantitative information synthesis ([256], [257],[258],.[259],] [255 ] demonstrate the high sensitivity of the FDG-PET of approximately 90%, at a specificity of approximately 78%. The malignancy of flocks with a diameter of over 10 mm is recorded with a sensitivity of 96% [256]. Imaging N-Staging The use of the lymph node size as an indicator of lymph node metastasis is an unreliable parameter, which applies to all morphological imaging methods ([235]; [260]) for example, the presence of a helicar and subcarinal lymph nodes of a large number of tumours can not be reached by the size of a disease. When applying a diameter of 10 mm in the short axis as a threshold, sensitivities and specificities of approximately 62% are achieved for the individual patient ([260]). Consequently, a third of the lymph nodes >2 cm in the small axis are not malignant. Nevertheless, enlarged lymph node is to be mentioned in the findings reports and their localization according to UICC (Union international contre le cancer), in order to be able to clarify them concretely in the further staging. In conjunction with an FDG-PET, the lymph node size is a helpful parameter: in a metaanalysis, in lymph node <10 mm and negative FDG PET, only a 5% probability of finding a 21 % probability of false negative N2 in >15 mm lymph node ([26]). This means that in small lymph node and normal PET no mediastinoscopy must be performed, but this finding must be verified in large lymph node despite negative PET.",

In particular, in central tumours there is excellent diagnostic safety [269], [270],[262], in peripheral tumors the hit rate depends on the round herd size [271],.[272]. In peripheral spatial requirements a combination of different techniques should be used (brush, needle, catheter, pliers) [273]. This can increase the diagnostic success rate by using a translucent device [281], <274], > [275], ] [276].

Bronchus in CT, a pre-existing malignant tumor, a 3 cm lesion size and when using rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) were observed ([265]). ROSE did not lead to an increase in diagnostic yield in a further metaanalysis of 5 studies, but required fewer needle passages during an EBUS TBNA ([283]). Oesophagus-related intrapulmonary tumours can be scored safely and with a high diagnostic yield of on average 90% transesophageal, including 11 studies with a total of 313 patients in this metaanalysis ([267]). The intervention-related lethality of bronchoscopy is in the promille range. The main complications, especially in peripheral lesions, are pneumothorax with a frequency of 1-4 % and mild haemorrhagia [284], [272],[275], therefore, should be pre-administered to a bronchopia of 276. Prior to bronchoscopy, a CT of the thorax should be performed. In the case of an enlarged lymph node in CT and/or a positive FDG-PET finding, transbronchial needle aspiration should be carried out during initial diagnostic bronchoscopy. This can achieve cytological protection in up to 70% of patients [285]. By adding endoscopic ultrasound methods, the hit rate can be increased to up to 90%, especially in non-subcarinal lymph node stations [286], [239].

Strong consensus In patients with lung carcinoma, the differentiation between small cell and non-small cell carcinomas is still the most important since their therapy differs in principle. The demarcation of small cell or non-minor cell lung carcinoma by sputum cytology, cytological evaluation of transthoracic fine needle aspirates of sow bronchoscopically obtained materials such as flushing, brushing or BAL is reliable. Schreiber and McCrory [289] evaluated in a systematic review 21 study in which the diagnostic accuracy of cytology with regard to the distinction of non-little cell and small cell carcinamas using different materials (transthoracale fine needle punctures in 14 studies, Sputum in 5 studi bronchoscopy obtained brush biopsies in 2 studies and transbronchial fine needle biopsia in 4 studies) was assessed in comparison to histology as a gold standard. The probability that a non-small cell carcinoma was diagnosed preoperatively but a small cell carcinoma was present was 2% (rate of false positive results between 1 and 7%). The probability of a small-cell carcinomas being diagnosed cytologically, although it was a nonsmall cell lung carcinom, was on average 9% with fluctuations between the individual studies from 0 to In a recent meta-analysis of 17 studies with 2235 cases, a great variability of the accuracy of the cytological diagnoses between the different studies was found, whereby squamous cell carzinomas with an average sensitivity of 84% could be more reliably diagnosed at a specificity of 90% as adenocarcinomas with a sensitivity of 63% and a specificness of The samples acquired in an EBUS TBNA were suitable, according to the analysis of a meta-analyses with 33 studies and a total of 2867 patients, in 94.5 % for EGFR analysis (n=2497) and in 94.9 % for ALT analysis, but were not published in particular as a result of POS1. However, statements on other molecular markers, in particular ROS1 and PD-L1, were not possible on the basis of the published data ([287]). Due to the higher rate of false-positive cytological diagnoses of small cell carcinoma [290] recommended that patients in whom cytological diagnosis of a small cell cancer was made, radiological and clinical findings against its presence, however, speak to a biopsy for histological diagnosis. Sputumcytology The cytological examination of sputum is the least invasive method for detecting lung carcinomas. Its diagnostic accuracy depends on the number of samples obtained, their preparation and tumour location and size. It is particularly suitable for central tumours and the occurrence of haemoptyses [291]. The systematic review of scribes and McCrory [289] included 17 studies on the diagnostic statement of the cytological sputume with more than 28,000 patients. The sensitivity of the 100 sensitivity ranged between 0,9 and 0,229. Most of the studies showed a higher sensitivity of 71% in the median for central versus 49% for peripheral tumours [292], [293]. The indication for sputum cytology was different in the studies. One of the trials conducted in patients suspected of having a lung carcinoma showed a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 94% [294]. Agusti et al. [292] also investigated only patients (n=60) suspected of developing a lung cancer, with sensitivity of only 43%, specificity 94%, a positive predictive value of 0.95 and a negative predictive level of 0.44. Without provocation with ultrasonic-fogged saline solution, sensitivity was significantly lower with 31%. 6.3 Imageg EK EK EC EC EK and diagnostic assurance 101 Thus, the method that allows only a diagnosis of species, was only considered in patients with a high degree of sensitivity.

It increases with the volume or number of points examined [302]. Mean sensitivity is 58%, whereas specificity is 97% [303]. Immunocytochemical studies can increase the accuracy and accuracy of the classification to a tumour type [301]. Diagnostic sensitivities are described by 90 % in order to determine room requirements [297], [298],[299],.[300], [3]. Especially in pulmonary lesions of less than 3 cm diameter, there are higher sensitivity than in bronchoscopy [296], < 298] [299 ], [300] [301]. The main complication of percutaneous puncture procedures is a pneumothorax, which must be expected to result in puncture of pulmonary processes in 10 to 30 % of cases [304].

Consensus-based recommendation tested 2024 If lung cancer is suspected, surgical biopsy should only be performed if less invasive methods of sampling have not resulted in definitive clarification or could not be performed. Strong consensus In patients with unclear pleural effusion and before performing curative local therapy (operation, irradiation) thoracoscopy should be carried out either in general anesthesia or in local anaesthetic to prove or exclude a pleural tumor sowing [305], [306] in case of inconspicuous cytology in the pleural puncture. For thoracoscopy in local anestheses rather than the less resource-intensive procedure compared to surgery, there are high sensitivities up to 95% [30.5] , [306]. The complication rate is below 1%, the main complication is bleeding.

Furthermore, no atelectase may be caused, or a splumped Hilus or a pleural effusion or any other indication of an advanced intrahoracal tumor disease [321], [316]. The above-mentioned parameters correspond to the arithmetic mean from the manual measurement of the longitudinal and transverse diameter of the circular herd in the same transversal size, or correnacal reference to the current rules. In this respect, for example, the size of 8 mm in the current version is largely equivalent to a size indication of 10 mm in previous versions of the guideline. Guidance adaptation: The recommendations formulated here represent an updated consolidated synopsis based on literature research, evidence assessment and recommendations derived from these international guidelines: • Guidelines for Management of Incidental Pulmonary nodules Detected on CT images: From the Fleischner Society 2017 [315] • British Thoracic Society Guidelines for the Investigation and Management of Pulmonarian Nodules. [317] Patient population(s): Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the recommendations, the recommendations given here apply to the following patient group: • Age > 18 years • One or more circumscribed lung round flocks, no disseminate herd 4 Incipients of the lung round herd (except for a small early lung cancer detection programme) 110 • No known malignancies (pre-) Disease • No immunocommitting • Outside a lung cancer early disease programme 4 Incdentially controlled lung ring herds (intestant) are frequently described in the early lung ring. In approximately 20-40% of CT-thorax studies, at least one lung ring herd is described; in the vast majority, these herds are benign; however, a small number corresponds to a lung carcinoma in the early stage. Lung round herd are classified according to their radiomorphology as solid or subsolide herd, whereby the subsolid herd in turn is distinguished into pure ground-glass (GG) and mixed-solid (part-solid, PS) herd. [315], [314] Anamnestically important findings are older X-ray images and CT studies. They provide first important indications of time duration and size growth of the herd . Evidence level 1a [316] Risk factors for malignant herd(s) are age, smoking status, anamnesia of extrapulmonary tumor, circular herd size, radiomorphological and localization in the lung lobes. Based on these independent risk factors, a pre-test probability for the malignancy of the round flock(e) is calculated ([3] Evidence, 2b. In clinical use of the models it is important to understand the population from which the respective model was derived. The Mayo-Clinic model was originally developed in a cohort from the 1980s. Patients with a history of lung cancer as well as patients with an extrathoracic malignancies that occurred less than 5 years ago were excluded, as are PET/CT findings not considered. [318] Herder et al. validated the Mayo Clinic model in a group of 106 patients with PET/ CT diagnostics, which increased the AUC by 13% from 0.79 to 0.92. [319], [317]. The Brock model is the only multivariate model that takes into account cases of multiple round-out herds. It was originally designed in a lung carcinoma screening population and has among all validated models the highest AUC for patients with a high lung carcinoma risk. [320] The evidence level 3 background text for the values 6.39 to 6.45 can be used to define the range of lung control. On the basis of this data, a cut-off value for the round herd size could be defined, below which further controls can be dispensed. In concrete terms, it could be shown that round herods < 5 mm diameter or < 100 mm3 ring herd volume do not require CT history control, as they are not associated with a significantly increased lung cancer risk. [326]. Evidence level 2+ [317]. However, studies have also shown that the volume measurement varies between different software packages, so it appears appropriate to set the limit for the 4 indirect lung herd (outside of a lung cancer early detection programme) 111 ring herod volume for safety reasons at 80 mm3. [317]. Even if no further controls appear to be indicated in the vast majority of patients in round-herds <5 mm, in individual cases, for patients with a high risk of lung carcinoma, malignomsuspect radiomorphology of the herd or localisation in the upper lobe, or in both cases, a CT monitoring is warranted. [ 315] This is equally true for patients who have a known malignant level of disease (< 300 mm). In this respect, for round herds < 300 mm3 (< 8 mm) where the PET-CT is less meaningful, a CT history check appears to be indicated without further risk assessment. A CT history control after 3 months has primarily the goal of identifying inflammatory herd as such. As a rule, these are dissolved after 3 month and the patient can be discharged from further control. Evidence level 3 [317]. A significant size growth of malignant herd will usually not be demonstrated after this short interval. Therefore, the Fleischner Society recommends 6-8 mm for a solid circular herd only after 6-12 months the first CT progression check and, in case of stability, a further control after 18-24 months (evidence level 3, strong recommendation 1c). [315] For the determination of size growth, in particular for small round flocks (< 6 mm), the accuracy level of the measurement is at least 2 times a year. Evidence level 2 [317] A volume change of at least 25 % is required to make the change significant. Evidence level2 [316]. 2D diameter measurements require this limit to be set at approximately 2 mm, as both intra- and inter-observer variability is large in manual measurement. In a retrospective comparative study, Revel et al. showed that measured size differences < 1.7 mm were only associated with a real change in round heart size in 5% [325], [318] Malignant lung round flocks have very different growth rates depending on the histological subtype. Some lung cancer types have very long VDTs, show longer stability periods or decrease even during interval screening, so no upper limit for the VDT can be safely excluded above the malignancy. Evidence levels 3 [3 17] Conversely, a very fast VDT (< 30 days) is more likely to show malignantness and indicates an inflammatory event. In the NEL-ranged population of 2 days and 1 day or 1 day of a VDT-range, there was a frequency of 4 hours or 1 month of a year. or 12-month interval), a 2-year lung cancer probability of 9.7%; for a VDT of 400–600 days, the 2-year incidence of lung cancer was 4.1%. Thus, in both populations, the lung cancer risk was significantly higher than in a comparator population without a lung ring (0.4%) and higher than for the overall screening population (1.3%). [326] Evidence level 2+ [317] The same study showed that the 2-year incidence risk was not significantly higher in a VDP of > 600 days at 0.8% than in subjects without a pulmonary ring herd. [326] Evidence levels 2+[317] The evidence cited for the assessment of VDT and the duration of follow-up refers to the estimation of lung disease risk (BTS 2015, [316]; Fleischner 2017, [315]. There is no reliable evidence to assess the probability of HDT and duration of monitoring is related to the incidence of HRT of three lung cancers (outside of a programme of breast cancer) and Eligibility for lung cancer. Pulmonary round herds have three possible methods: transbronchial biopsy, transthoracic (CT-controlled) biopsy or minimally invasive surgical resection (VATS). Depending on the size and location of the round hernd, as well as individual patient factors (comorbidity, operability, intended diagnostic safety, etc.), the most appropriate method for the respective patient should be chosen in an interdisciplinary consensus. Background text for the recommendations 6.46 to 6.48: Special features of subsolid lung round flocks Subsolide lung round cookers are to be assessed separately as they represent lesions that have a better prognosis than solid round flock, but paradoxically are more malignant than these, with a mixed-solide morphology being an independent predictor of malignity. Persistent pure milk glass herd often correspond to an atypical adenomatous hyperplasia or an adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), both by non-semalignant but potentially premalignitantly administered to a minimum herdicular disease, and the presence of a presenological disease. for malignancy, which can already be measured in initial diagnostics, are higher age (≥ 65 years), lung carcinoma in history, size, as well as a mixed-solide nature of the herd. Evidence levels 2++ [317]. Other criteria for maligenity are the size of the solid component, pleural recovery or a bullous/cystic appearance. Evidence level 3 [317]. While CT routine controls in a solid herd serve to differentiate a malignant lesion from a benign lesion over time, CT course controls in subsolid lung herds typically serve to identify the optimal time for intervention or to completely avoid intervention in the context of the overall morbidity of the patient. Because even in the case of already existing malignity, the rate of growth of subsolid pulmonary herd is abnormally low, with a conspicuousness of size and a lack of progression often over several years. Accordingly, a long (3 – 5 years) should be the duration of the clinical response level3. In particular, the solid component - or the addition of a solid portion within the lactation lesion in the course of the process is an alarm signal and should be an occasion to discuss a definitive pathological clarification or directly a surgical resection. Evidence level 3 [317] Background text for the recommendations 6.49 to 6.52: Further clarification of lung round flocks > 8 mm. The Fleischner-Society recommends a CT check after 3 months for patients with a solid, non-calculated, solitary round herd with a diameter of more than 8 mm, a further imaging with a combined positron emission tomography (PET) and CT (P ET/CT), tissue removal or a 4 Incidentally Lung Round Herd (out of a lung cancer early detection program) 113 combination of the above methods. Depending on the size and morphology of the herd, comorbidity and individual malignancy risk and other factors, each of these options may be appropriate. (Evidenzlevel 1A; strong recommendation). An essential role here is played by the patient's presence or control definitely. The FDG PET-CT has a good sensitivity (89% - 94%) and a moderate specificity (75% - 85%) for the diagnosis of a malignant round herd in patients with a high risk of malignancy and a solid ring herd of unsafe aetiology ≥ 10 mm, with limited evidence for round herods < 10 mm and a significantly low specificity of 61% in regions with an endemic accumulation of inflammatory lung diseases [256], [330]. Another imaging (CT) for assessing growth increases the sensitivity of the malignancies assessment. Evidence level 1− supported by 2++ [315] The Herder model is suitable to recalculate the maligenity probability of a solid lung herd after carrying out a PET/CT. The PET- CT has a lower sensitivity and a higher false negative rate in SSNs. Evidence level 2 + 3 + + + 4 + 5 + 3 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 5 + 15 - 15 - 3 + 15 + 15 Rapid-section diagnosis shows high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, with generally low complication rates evidence level 3 [315] The BTS guideline quotes five case series. All series reported high sensitivity and particularity with a definitive diagnosis achieved in all cases and low morbidity and mortality rates (one patient died in 1331 combined cases). However, the rate of benign diagnoses in the cited series varies considerably. Two case series for the surgical resection of suspect lung round flocks in CT screening populations (from Denmark and Italy), reported benigne resection rates of 12% and 22% respectively. [331], [332],[315 ] The level of pre-test predictability for the presence of a malignancies, which makes it acceptable, directly indicate surgical reection or non-surgical ablative therapy, is not exactly defined. The IASLC (International Diagnosis Index 8) does not refer to a clinical study. Based on data from the CT screening studies, a guideline size of 85%, i.e. no more than 15% of surgical resections should lead to benign diagnoses. [333]. A similar pre-test probability is also required for the indication for stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SBRT) without prior pathological protection (empirical SBRT), in non-operable patients [334]. Some retrospective, smaller, mostly mono-institutional case series for empirical SBRI in inoperable subjects with high suspicion of the presence of a malignant round herd showed similar results with and without prior pathogenic protection. [315] A recent meta-analysis of data from 43 studies with over 11,000 patients showed that patients with clinically or pathologically diagnosed NSCLC at an early stage who were treated with SB RT showed significant differences in survival with a shorter OS, CSS and DFS in the group with previously pathological NSCLS [35]. NSCLC in the early stage, which was treated with SBRT, but significant differences in survival with a shorter OS, CSS and DFS in the group with previously pathologically secured NSCLS. [335]. This indicates a significant proportion of benign findings in the population of patients treated without pathological protection and underlines the clear recommendation for pathological safety before planned SBRI if this is feasible with reasonable risk in individual cases. 6.5 Stadi EK iensteilung (Staging) 114 Stadium classification (Stating) A stage classification should be performed for prognostic assessment, therapy planning and for reasons of quality assurance in all patients. Only in patients where due to e.g. poor general condition no tumor-specific therapy can be performed and which can therefore only be treated with supportive palliative, due to lack of therapeutic consequences can be dispensed with systematic staging studies. Here diagnosis is exclusively symptom-oriented to carry out palliatory measures. A minimal difference between SCLC and NSCDIS is not possible in the case of clinical diagnosis. The comparison of results of clinical studies and the evaluation of registers is only possible by classification of tumours. Thus, the classification of the tumors according to their degree of spread is a central instrument in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancers. The increasing importance of other parameters (smoking status, gender, mutations, PDL-1 expression, degree of COPD) and the interaction with the tumour spread have not been well investigated, although they have an increasing influence on the prognosis. To this extent, the TNM classification is only an important but indispensable component for the care of patients with lung cancer. The 8th edition of the T NM classification has been developed by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer on the basis of almost 100,000 data sets from 1999 - 2010 and provided to the UICC [337] consensus-based recommendation tested 2024 The diagnosis of lung carcinoma is always to be accompanied by an exact TN M classification. Strong consensus Background 6.45 General definitions The definitions correspond to the recommendations of the tnm supplement, 5. Circulation of 2019.

It is based on findings collected prior to treatment. These results are derived from clinical examination, imaging procedures, endoscopy, biopsy, surgical exploration and other relevant investigations. • Pathological classification: the postoperative histopathological classification, called pTNM, is used for adjuvant therapy indication and provides additional data to estimate the prognosis and calculate final results. In this classification, the pre-treatment findings are supplemented or modified by findings obtained during surgical intervention and pathological examination. The pathological assessment of the primary tumor (pT) requires a resection of the primal tumor or biopsies that are adequate for determining the highest pT category. Pathological evaluation of the regional lymph node (pN) requires the removal of lymph nodes to an extent that makes the statement of the absence of regional lymph nodal metastases (p N0) reliable and, on the other hand, sufficient to determine the highest PN category. Excision biopsy of a lymph node without pathological determination is not sufficient. (pM) requires microscopic examination. • Once T-, N- and M- and/or pT-, pN- and pM-categories are established, these can be grouped into stages. TNM classification and stages must, once established, remain unchanged in medical records. Clinical and pathological parameters can be combined if only incomplete information is available regarding the clinical or pathological classification. • If in individual cases there are doubts as to the correct allocation to the T, N and M category, the lower, i.e. less advanced, category should be chosen. This should also be taken into account when determining the stages. Particularities and explanations of TNMA classification 5 Stadi iene classification (staging) T classification • If size plays a role in T status, then measurement of invasive components is to be considered. • Tumor in perineural sheaths in the vicinity of primary localization are considered as part of T classification and can be documented separately as Pn1, as this invasion may be an independent predictive factor. (No regional lymph node metastases) includes lymph nodes that are clinically not suspicious of the presence of metastasis, even if they are palpable or durc imaging methods. The clinical category N1 (regio lymph node metadata) is applied if there is sufficient clinical suspicion, e.g. a firming, enlargement of the lymph node or alteration in the imaging procedures. The term \"adenopathy\" is not sufficiently precise to indicate lymph nodemetastasis. • The direct spread of a primary tumor in lymph node is classified as lymph node metabolism. • Metastases in any lymph node that does not belong to the regional ones are classified as remote metastasses. If there are doubts about the correct category to which a special case should be assigned, then the lower, i.e. less advanced category should be selected. • An invasion of lymph vessels (tumor cells in channels lined with endothel, so-called carcinometosa or lymph vasodis are considered as being isolated.) If tumor deposits measure 0.2mm or who, they are considered to be isolated tumour cells. M-classification • The MX category should no longer be used in the use of clinical TNM classification because metastases can be detected solely on the basis of physical examination. (Using MX can cause a patient to be excluded from staging and documentation). • pMx: can not be used • PM0: can only be used after autopsies • p M1: may also be used following cytological or histological biopsies (e.g. after puncture of a liver metastasis of a lung carcinoma ipsilateral LK-MTS cT3cN2pM1b(HEP). • Metastases in lymph nodes that do not belong to the regional lymph node are classified as remote metastasase. A TNM classification for primary trachea neoplasms does not exist and cannot be used. The T classification The T-classification explanation primary tumor cannot be assessed or evidence of malignant cells in the sputum or in bronchial flushing, but tumor radiologically or bronchoscopically not visible. no Anhalt for primary tumor carcinoma in situ with pure lepidic growth up to 3 cm for adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinomas in situ. [338] minimally invasive adenocarcinoma solitaire adenoxacinoma no more than 3 cm in the largest extent, with a predominantly lepidiac growth pattern and no more then 5 mm invasive portion. Tumors 3cm or less in the greatest extent, surrounded by lung tissue or visceral pleura, no bronchoscopy detection of an infiltration proximal of a lappenbronchus (mainly lepid growth pattern) is also classified as superficially free from one tumor. A rare, superficially spreading tumor of any size with infiltration limited only to the bronchial wall is classified as T1 even if it expands further proximally. Tumor up to and including 1cm in largest extent Tumor more than 1cm and up to or including 2cm in greatest extent Tumour more than 2cm and to or less than 3cm in widest extent Tumo more than 3 cm, but not more than 5 cm in largest extension or tumor with at least one of the following characteristics: • Tumor infects main bronchus, 2 cm or further distal of the carina without infestation of the Carina • Tumour infiltrates visceral pleura • Associated atelectase or obstructive inflammation up to the Hilus, either parts of the lungs or the whole lung absorbing tumor up to including 4cm",

An infillation of further distally located vascular sections does not qualify for a classification according to T4. A direct spread to the parietal pericard is classified as T3, to which visceral pericard is called T4 . The term pancoast tumor originally refers to a complex of symptoms or a syndrome caused by a tumor that can determine from the lungs the structures of the upper thorax pericurate and can therefore trigger variable clinical symptoms. The treatment of lung carcinoma with infilturation of the higher thoracic tract is independent of the frequency of the indigestion. The extent of the disease varies in these tumours and should be classified according to known rules. An invasion of the vertebral body or spinal canal or a walling of the subclavia vessels or an advanced involvement of upper branches of the plexus brachialis (C8 or above) is classified as T4. If none of these criteria are present, the tumor is classified T3. Due to the small number of documented cases, this differentiation between T3 and T4 is not well documented. 6.5.1.1.2 The N classification Table 17: The N category",

An N-staging is generally considered to be adequate, if there is a sample of 11 or right-side tumor rtumnosis, or a study of 11. The UICC recommends that at least 6 lymph nodes/stations be removed and shown as tumor-free by histological examination to classify pN0. Three of these lymph node or station should be of mediastinal origin, including the subcarinal lymph node (No.7) and three of the N1 lymph node/station. If all resected and histologically studied lymph node are negative, but the number of recommended lymph node has not been reached, pN 0 must nevertheless be classified.

The most pleural (pericardial) discharges that are associated with a lung carcinoma are not attributable to the patient's disease. However, the incidence of these tumour cells are classified as a few of the tumour cells. If these results of the investigations and the clinical evaluation strongly suggest that the effusion is not caused by tumor, then this effluent should not be considered in the staging and the patient should be classified as M0. Tumor herds in the ipsilateral parietal and visceral pleura that occur discontinuously from a direct pleura invasion of the primary tumor are classified as m1a. Discontinuous tumor beyond the parietal pleural in the chest wall or in the diaphragm is classified as an M1b.

The tumor-free lung tissue should be examined histologically with regard to the question of tumour-related and tumor-independent changes. Strong consensus background The recommendations are based on an expert consensus (see chapter 2.2.4). In addition to a macroscopic description of the reection preparation, parameters are already being recorded here which influence the TNM classification (tumour size, relation to pleura visceralis or e.g . to the thorax wall in extended resections, other tumor herds) and the R-classification [344] (see section 6.6.6 and chapter 6.7), the tumor tissue can be acquired by a representative view of the tumor. In this case, a possible heterogeneity of the tumour tissue should be recorded, which can reach a significant extent, in particular with regard to the subtypes of adenocarcinoma. The definition of adenocarcinomas in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocracinoma (MIA) shows that these diagnoses require full paraffin embedding and gradual histological examination of the corresponding tumour tissue [345] see Chapter 6.6.4 and Chapter 6.6.6.8). In the histologic examination, the relationship of the tumor relevant for TNM classification to the pleura visceralis should also be recorded (EvG staining required). Due to the relevance of the TN M classification, all lymph nodes present in the resection preparation should be prepared macroscopically for presentation and investigated in accordance with Chapter 6.6.3. In order to ensure that the regional lymph node is detected as fully as possible, attention should be paid to the narrow lamination of the receptive preparation and to the presence of the bronchopular tissue. Therefore, a histological examination of the tumor-free lung parenchym should be carried out regularly. Care should be taken to detect not only the frequently present secondary changes in the tumour margin. The tumor- free lung tissue asserved in the corresponding paraffin blocks is also suitable for complementary investigations, e.g. lung dust analyses. A template for pathology findings of biopsy and resection preparation can be taken from the annexes Chapter 19.1 and Chapter 19.2. 6.6 Patho EK SCH-anatomical diagnostics 129 Processing of lymph nodes Consensus-based recommendation tested 2024 All lymph node that is taken from preoperative staging, mediastinoscopy, videoassisted mediastinal lymphadenectomy (VAMLA) or within the scope of tumor resection should be fully embedded in paraffin and histologically examined in step sections (at least 2 cutting stages, HE staining). Consensus Background The recommendations are based on an expert consensus (see chapter 2.2.4). The designation of the regional lymph nodes of malignant lung tumours should be used to standardise and improve interdisciplinary communication in accordance with the current recommendations of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) [342]. The advantage of this lymph node mapping is in particular the precise definition of the anatomical limits of the individual lymph node stations [346]. For the fullest possible detection of the regionry lymph node metastases, all lymph nodules that are collected in the context of preoperative staging, mediastinoscopy, video-assisted mediastinal lymphadenectomy (VAMLA) or in the framework of tumor resection should be fully embedded in paraffin and examined in stages (at least 2 cutting levels) histologically.

Histopathological typing Consensus-based recommendation tested 2024 The histological typification of lung tumours in resection preparations as well as small biopsies and cytological preparations is to be performed according to the criteria of the respective valid WHO classification.

It is often necessary to distinguish between primary lung carcinomas of metastases. Moreover, due to current treatment options, small biopsies and cytological preparations also show the need for as exact a histological typing of non-small cell carcinoma. The current WHO classification [346] explicitly indicates that typing as \"NSCLC-NOS\" (non-small-cell lung carcinoma, not further specified) should be used as rarely as possible. To achieve this goal, corresponding histochemical and immunohistochemical studies should be carried out according to the WHO classification. The recommended markers are to be found in the respective chapters of the current WHO Classification (diagnostic algorithm, see figure in chapter 6.6.10). In the case of neuroendocrine lung tumours, the confirmation of a large cell neuroenocrine carcinom is also required for the diagnosis of the neutrophic disease. Also to confirm the diagnosis (e.g. demarcation of artifially modified infiltrates of a typical carcinoid vs. small cell carcinoma) the proliferation fraction of the tumour tissue must be determined immunohistochemically in all neuroendocrine tumours (Ki67, MiB1) and in the findings report. It should be taken into account that the WHO classification of typical and atypical carcinoides is not available among other criteria, not based on proliferation fraction but on the number of mitosis per 2mm2. Thus, in the case of small biopsies there may be a problem that an area of 2mm2 tumour tissue or 10 HPF (high power fields) does not exist. A safe differential diagnostic demarciation between typical and non-typical carcinoids is then not possible in the absence of detection of necrosis or at least 2 mitosis in the biopsy. The immunohistochemically determined proliferation fraction (Ki67, MiB1) is not a diagnostic criterion defined by the WHO classification [346]. Tumor expansion on the resection preparation (staging) Consensus-based recommendation tested 2024 The pathological-anatomical staging is to be performed according to the definitions of the relevant TNM classification. Strong consensus background The recommendation is based on an expert consensus (see chapter 2.2.4). The local or loco-regional expansion into the stage of a lung tumor represents a prognostic and therapeutic relevant factor [347], [348],[349],.[350]. Therefore, in the reection preparation and the regional lymph nodes which are also surgically removed, the tumor expansion should be recorded as standard. The pathologic-anatomatic staging is examined according to each valid TNm classification (currently 8th edition, [344) for the purpose of determining the TM population definition. Strong Consensus Background The recommendation is based on an expert consensus (see chapter 2.2.4). In the case of multiple lung tumours, the question of an intrapulmonary systemic metastasis of a tumor versus two or more resectable primary tumours is raised. In addition to comparing histological differentiation, different tumour manifestations should be compared immunohistochemically and molecularly pathologically with respect to their clonality based on biopsies or resectates. Commonly and polymorphically mutated genes are particularly suitable for molecular reconciliation (e.g. KRAS, PTEN, TP53). Clinical data suggest that the total 5-year survival of patients with multiple, non-metastatic lung carcinomas after surgical resection is comparable with patients with singular tumours in identical tumor stadia [351]. 6.6 Patho EK clinical diagnosis 136 resection margins – R-classification Consensual recommendation 2024 In the assessment of resectional cancers, as a rule, the incidence margins of the bronchos should be evaluated. Strong Consensus Background The recommendation is based on an expert consensus (see chapter 2.2.4). The tumor-freeness of the resection margins is therefore an established prognosis factor in surgically treated lung cancers [352], [353],[355],.[356]. Therefore, in the assessment of resection preparations, the reection margins should be examined by default. In particular, the bronchus and vascular resection edges, in locally advanced tumours or extended resections, e.g. also the re-section margins of the pericardium, mediastinal or thorax wall should be considered. In the case of re-ection preparations, in which the resection margin is closed by parent seams, the relationship of the tumor to the staple seam is to be recorded. The histological examination of the immediate resection margin is then not possible. Instead, the margin resulting from the sparing cutting of the bracket is histically examined. In case of scarcely resection-restricted tissue, the result is frequently obtained. Based on the results obtained, the R-classification should be given (TNM classification, 8th edition, [344]): • R0: no residual tumor • R1: microscopic residual tumor• R2: macroscopic residual tumour • RX: presence of residual tumor cannot be assessed The indication of R2 status requires appropriate clinical information from the surgeon. According to the 8th issue of the TNM Classification \"should always include remote metastasis in terms of the prognostic significance of R-Classification\". However, there is no general consensus in this respect, since \"some believe that R-classification can only be applied in relation to primary tumor and its local or regional spread. Others have wider use of R classification and include remote metastases\" (T NM Classification, 8. issue, [344). Therefore, the respective use of the R classification should be indicated with respect to its local and regional spreads. Others will have included R-gradification more commonly used and included in remote metastatics (TnM Classification), 8. In some lung tumours, the degree of differentiation is derived from histological typing, e.g. in sarcomatoid carcinomas (pleomorphic carcinoma, carcinos and pulmonary blastoma) or in neuroendocrine tumours (typical carcinoids, atypical carcinoids, large cell neuroenocrine carcinomes, small cell carcinoms). Therefore, a histopathological grading should not be specified separately in these tumours. Consensus Background The recommendations are based on an expert consensus (see chapter 2.2.4). • Well differentiated (G1): predominant lepidic and < 20% high-grade patterns. • Moderately differentiated ( G2): predominant azinary or papillär and < 20 % high-degree patterns.• Badly differentiated(G3): each tumor with ≥ 20% high grade patterns (solide, three micropapilular criteria). However, there is only insufficient data on the criteria to be taken into account [[346]]. In the case of other lung tumours, the degree of differentiation is derived from histological typing. For example, sarcomatoid carcinomas (pleomorphic carcinoma, carcinosarcoma and pulmonary blastoma) are considered to be poorly differentiated. Histological Typing already includes the grading of neuroendocrine tumours (typical carcinoids, atypical carcinoids, large cell neuroenocrine carcinomes, small cell carcinoms). Therefore, for these tumours a histopathological Grading is not specified separately [[336]. 6.6 Pathologis EK RG no I: Prim RG mor IIa: vita vita RG mor IIb: stratia vita sch-anatomische Diagnosis 138 Regression Grading Consensus-based Recommendation is examined after prior radio- and/or chemotherapy, the extent of the tumour progression is determined according to the frequency or frequency. Prior radio- and/or chemotherapy represents the extent of the treatment-induced tumour regression in the area of primary tumor and regional lymph nodes an independent prognosis factor [358], [359]. The extent of vital tumour tissue and tumour necrosis as well as reactive changes such as foam cell reaction, granulation tissue formation, cholesterol crystal precipitation and huge cell reaction are determined using the microscopic examination of the tumor tissue and reported according to the regression grade according to Junker [3 59]. Other studies on neoadjuvant therapy in lung carcinomas have also correlated the results with the proportion of tumours with histopathologically pronounced or complete regression (major pathologic response/MPR or complete pathologic response/pCR/CPR) as appropriate. These parameters are also derived from the here recommended regression grading (RG IIb or RG III, u.) for the purpose of determining the full incidence of the tumour. The treatment of the regional lymph nodes corresponds to the procedure described above (see Chapter 6.6.3). The following degrees of regression (RG) are distinguished: a tumour regression or only spontaneous tumour regression in the area of the märtum and the regional Lymph nodes rphological detection of a therapy-induced tumor regression with at least 10% alemresttumor in the range of the primary tumor and/or more than small herdous detection of alen tumour tissue in the regional lymph node rphologic evidence of a treatment-induced tumour regression with less than 10% alemrest tumor in the field of the Primary tumor and / or only small-herd detection of Alen tumour tissues in the regionally lymph node. 6.6 Pathologis RG kein I: Prim RG kom III: Bere EK EK EC EC sch-anatomische Diagnosis 139 ne Tumor regression or an exclusively spontaneous tumour progression in the domain of the marmal tumor and the regionally lymph node mplette therapy induced tumor regression without detection of vital tumour tissue and lymph node in the primary region.

Investigations for molecular target structures Consensus-based recommendation tested 2024 Based on the available tumour tissue / tumour cells of all NSCLC in stage IV, molecular pathological investigations are to be initiated regarding all therapeutically relevant molecular changes (according to current status prior to first-line therapy as a minimum requirement EGFR mutations in the exons 18-21, BRAF V600 mutations, ALK fusions, ROS1 fusions and RET fusions), and NTRK1-3 fusions. Strong consensus-based recommendations tested 20-24 In addition, the following biomarkers should be tested in stage 4 of NSClc: KRAS mutations and MET amplifications and met-exon 14-skipping mutations as well as NRG1-fusions and Her2-amplification and HER2 (ERBB-exhibition-based mutations) in the field 20-consensitivity-resions of the EGF24-consence-based tumorstance-recommendence-rezion-based test. EGFR mutations in exons 19 and 21 should also be performed in early tumour stages (IB – IIIA) on the basis of the tumour tissue available after tumour resection. Consensus-based recommendation modifies 2024 In the tissue samples of therapy-naïve patients in stage IV an immunohistochemical examination for PD-L1 expression should be performed parallel to the molecular pathological studies.* 6.6 Patho EK ologis sch-anatomische Diagnose 140 Consensual recommendation modified 2024 If only cytological preparations with tumour cells are available, a treatment in cell block technology with subsequent immunocytochemical analysis for PD L1 expression (TPS, s.u.) should be carried out in appropriate patients. The result should be demonstrated as a percentage of membrane-like positive tumour cells (tumour proportion score, TPS) and as a percent of positive immune cells (immun cell score, IC score). An external quality assurance in the context of ring trials is to be demonstrated. Also in patients in early stages of non-small cell lung carcinomas a corresponding examination (TPS) should be performed. After determination of a therapeutically relevant TPS value a test on EGFR mutations (Exone 18-21 and ALK fusions) is to take place in these tumors. *The recommendation for the examination of the PD-L1 expression applies to all histological NSCLC types (see also the therapy algorithm NSCLS IV) Consensus-based recommendation tested 2024 In the molecular pathological studies a methodology is to use, which comes within 10 working days to a definitive diagnosis, and which is sensitive enough to detect mutations also in tissues with only 10 % tumor content. For the detection of fusions fluorescence-in-situ hybridizations and immunohistochemical detection or sequencing methods according to the recommendations of the German Society for Pathology are to be used.5. 5See: [360] Strong Consensus-based recommendation tested 2024 In case of insufficient tissue for molecular diagnostics, and if a new biopsy cannot be performed at reasonable risk, a liquid biopsy should be performed, provided that histological/cytological diagnosis is ensured. 6.6 Patho EK EK sch-anatomical diagnosis Consensual recommendation verified 2024 Strong Conssensus- based recommendation reviewed 2024 For acquired EGFR-TKI resistance as well as acquired resistance according to ALK, ROS or RET inhibitor therapy, a recovery of tumour cell material for determination of resistance mechanisms should be carried out. Strong Consent-based Recommendation tested 2023 In case the TKI resistance is acquired and negative biopsy or clinically unacceptable biopsy in relation to the resistance mechanism should be completed by a tumor cell to determine resistance mechanisms. Strong consensus-based recommendations examined 2024 If there is acquired TKI-resistance and acquited resistance after treatment of ALK-, ROs or RIT-inhibitor therapy, the extraction of tumor cell material should be conducted on the basis of a tumor diagnosis. After the tumor diagnosis and completion of histological typing, molecular pathological investigations can be initiated based on the available tumour tissue/tumour cells. Therapeutic relevance in non-small cell lung carcinomas is currently EGFR and BRAF V600 mutations as well as ALK, and ROS-1, RET and NTR translocation (see chapter 8.6). It is assumed that this spectrum will successively expand. Various methods are available for appropriate investigations. A quality-secured, tissue-saving and comprehensive methodology is to be used. As a rule, Sanger sequencing is not suitable for this purpose because a sensitivity of 10% is not achieved. Sanger sequenced is used to produce a mean sign of many single strand sequences. Therefore, for the detection of mutations, a minimum level of tumor cells in the tissue is required, which must not be less than 10 %-20. In parallel sequenced multiple single strand sequenced sequences are performed side by side, so that small number of PC-reduced methods can be demonstrated. Several studies have demonstrated the superior sensitivity of parallel sequencing or PCR-based methods to classical sanger technologies [361], [362]. In the S of optimising the treatment planning of patients with NSCLC, a comprehensive molecular examination of S1ng n vant pie RK1-3ität nal n en en Sinne 6 Pathoologis sch-anatomische Diagnostik 142 can be carried out as early as possible during the course of the disease by means of a parallel segmentation (NGS). In non-small cell lung cancers with proven activating EGFR mutation and tumour progression under a therapy with a corresponding tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in the case of a new mutation analysis, especially on s. g. resistance mutations (in particular T790M mutation, met amplification, her2 amplifying and mutation as well as other targets) should be considered when performing a new mutagenic analysis, in which case of tumour tissue/tumour cells are not sufficiently available, and where the DNA is isolated from all plasma. For this purpose, the adherence to special protocols for plasma preparation for ctDNA recovery is necessary. In the case of a resistance analysis after targeted therapy in patients in which tumour tissue/tumour cells are not sufficiently available/ are also sequencing a comprehensive gene panel at ctdNA, which detects mutations in tyrosine kinase, bypass mutations and gene fusions including testing for PD-L1 expression In various studies, NSCLC has been able to establish a correlation between immunohistochemically proven PD- L1 expression and response to therapy with monoclonal antibodies directed against PD-1 or PD-l1. Therefore, immunohistone chemical studies on the question of PD- l1 expression are to be performed and the result is indicated as a percentage of membranely positive tumour cells (tumour proportion score/ TPS) and for stage IV tumours are also to be reported as area percentages of positive immune cells (immune cell score/IC score) [364]. In the case of an adjuvant immunotherapy of NSCLC, the appropriate approval excludes the use of functional tumours with an EGFR mutation or an ALK fusion. Therefore, in addition to the quantification of the PD-L1 expression (TPS), an analysis of EGF mutations and ALK diffusions was not included in the corresponding approval study. Thus, as well as the quantification of the PD-L-1 expression (TPS) an analysis is required for the determination of a therapeutically relevant PD- L1 TPS value is required. As monoclonal antibodies for lung cancer directed against PD-1 or PD-l1 are approved, this testing is significant for the planning of therapy (see figure) 6.6 Patho ologische-anatomy © Leitlini ische Diagnose ienprogramm Onk kology In this guideline, people with 70 or more years of age are defined as very old people aged 80 or older. Age over 70 years Evidence-based recommendation 2010 grade In patients of higher age (>70 years) a particularly careful diagnosis and clinical evaluation of comorbidities should be carried out. nce Consensus Perioperative morbidity increases with increasing age. In older patients undergoing lung resection, there is a higher probability that they need intensive perioperative care [367], [368],[369],.[370] (Evidence Grade 3b). Preoperatively, a careful evaluation of comorbidities must be performed as the association of increasing age and operational letality is increased with respect to the wider range of comorobidities and not with regard to age alone [371], <372],<373]. As with younger patients, the incidence of obesity is also increased with regards to the extent of obesity, in particular, the proportion of obesity to the right. Perioperative lethargy increases at very high age (>80 years) depending on the overall biological state, tumour stage, severity, number of comorbidities and extent of lung resection. The risk of lethality is particularly high after pneumonectomy. In case of suspicion of age syndrome (intelligence degradation, immobility, instability, incontinence and impairment) a geriatric baseline assessment is indicated [374], [367] (evidence level 2b). In the case of a postbronchodilator FEV1 >1.5 l and a diffusion capacity (TLCO) >60 % of the target value and in a planned pneumonectomy in a post bronchodilation FEV2 > 2.0 l and TLCO > 60 % of target value are no more than TCO based. If the preoperative FEV1 > 1.5 l for lobectomy and > 2.0 l for pneumonectomy is expected to be [375] (evidence level 2b), however, the predicative significance of preoperative values in % should not be considered. Therefore, the values of the FEV 1 are given as absolute values. However, the perioperative risk of thorax surgery in COPD patients is already relevant in a FEV1, < 60% of the target value, with the complication rate depending on the extent of resection and resection technique ([376], [377],[378]) (evident level 2B). Because of the frequent co-incidence of lung cancer with pulmonary emphysema and interstitial lung disease, a preoperative lung function test should primarily include the determination of TLCO, especially since spirometry can still be normal in these patients, which is TLCo an independent prognostic factor [38,38] [38]3.",

If this is a heterogeneous pulmonary emphysema and the tumor to be removed is located in an emphysematically converted lung lobe, which can be removed as part of a lung volume reduction, the postoperative functional impairment is less likely than computational [404].

      "text": "The calculation of the postoperatively expected parameters of lung function (FEV1, CO transfer factor) to estimate the risk of pneumonectomy and lobectomy is presented in Table 19. Perioperative resection risks are in relation to the absolute predictive postoperative FEV1 [392], [407],[385],.[408], [3] [409], [10]. This is equivalent to the corresponding values of the CO transfer coefficient [408, [379], [...] [411], ... [380]. A predicative postoperative FEV1 of 800 ml appears to be sufficient for resection treatment [392,]. Pneumonezomie has a good correlation of the Postoperatively Measured FEV1, [412], with preoperatively use of lung functions and perfusion scintigram (split-lung function) calculated values [375],] [393], but [394] There is a bad correlation between the post-operatively measured FEV1/(%sol) and the pre-operative frequency of the lung function [3]. An alternative method is based on the number of segments to be resected [367], [413],[395]. This mathematical method requires further evaluation, in particular with regard to the influence of ventilated and dystelectatic segments in the lung segment to be rectified and the prognostic relevance of the postoperative functional data calculated in this way. Current clinical studies suggest that the calculation of postoperative lung function is possible with the help of the quantitative analysis of resectative and residual lung volume from standardized data bases of the CT and MRI of the thorax instead of quantified perfusion scintigraphy with just as good results [414], (395), [415].

For TLCO, a limit of over 30 % is also recommended [385], the current literature shows that FEV 1 and TL CO are independent prognosis factors of perioperative morbidity and letality [386] in relation to remission [38, [38]. Values between 45 and 60 mmHg were associated with increased risk [367], [389]. Hypoxaemia, while identifying patients at risk, should not be considered as an exclusion criterion as there may be a distribution disorder or pulmonary shunt, so that resection could improve gas exchange. Current studies show that hypercapnia is not necessarily predictive for resection complications [390]. This is particularly true for patients with maintained respiratory muscle function and load capacity [369]. A higher risk for postoperative complications is present in patients who already have oxygen saturation (SaO2) below 90% at rest (corresponding to a PaO2 of approximately 60 mm Hg) or who are more than 4 % unsaturated [418] under stress, [419]. Only the decrease in oxygen saturation under stress does not justify the exclusion of a thoracotomy [420].

Previous aortocoronary bypass surgery In lung resections, patients with a successful aorticocoronar bypass surgery for at least 5 years do not have an increased perioperative risk unless symptoms of coronary heart disease or heart failure occur again [368]. 6.7 Absc Table Modifiz High risk Medium risk Low risk Table of clinical and functional operability 151 3 Preoperative assessment of cardiovascular risks The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association have published comprehensive recommendations for the clinical prediction of perioperational risks [425]. These are based on clinical predictors (see Table 20), stress tolerance of the patient and planned surgical intervention. Recently published studies have highlighted the importance of multiple risk factors (see table 21) [426]. The perioperative risk of patients, however, could be increased in higher-grade carotid stenosis [367]. Therefore, a carotide doppler and duplex sonography should be performed in all patients with a history of stroke or TIA or with fluid noise over the carotides prior to planned lung resection. In patients with a history of stroke or TIA, or with fluid noise over the carotids, frequency of hyperactivity should be performed with a Karotis Doppler and duplex sonography. In symptomatic or high-grade, but asymptomatic stenosis (>70%) of extracranial brain-providing arteries, interventional or surgical treatment of stenitis should be discussed prior to lung resection ([428], [424]) (Evidence grade 1b) (Recommendation grade B). e 24: Clinical predictors of increased, perioperative, cardiovascular risk.

Such patients are often inoperable due to metastases or a locally advanced disease. 1 Weight loss A weight loss of more than 10% within 6 to 8 weeks is often reported as clinically and predictively relevant. There are no studies that have correlated weight loss as an independent predictive perioperative risk indicator. 2 Performance status It is known that the physical performance (measured according to WHO, Karnofsky or ECOG Scale) is correlated with the prognoses of patients with lung cancer [368]. In a series of operations of 331 patients, the Karnoffsky index was not an independent predicator of postoperative complications, although in this study only a few patients with low physical performance were subject to surgery [408]. Preoperative assessment of other risks of continued smoking increased the risk of pulmonary carcinome in the context of 6. In the case of an age syndrome (depletion of intelligence, immobility, instability, incontinence and impairment) there is an indication of a geriatric screening and basic assessment [374]. ung 11: Algorithm for the assessment of the operability of lung-resizing interventions 1 Integration Patient Enlightenment Introduction The patient information is one of the central tasks of the physician and a crucial part of the doctor-patient communication. It serves to establish a relationship of trust and active cooperation between doctor and patient [432]. According to the applicable law, information on therapy measures is mandatory, provided that the patient is able to take into account. As a precondition for the informed consent of the patient (informed consent), the explanation is required only for medical actions [433]. The patient's rights law, which came into force on 26 February 2013, governs in § 630e BGB the information obligations of the treater [434] according to which the need for medical advice is also obliged to determine the extent to be used, to determine whether the consequences and to apply them. In the case of the Enlightenment, it is also necessary to point out alternatives to the measure if several medically equally indicated and usual methods can lead to substantially different burdens, risks or chances of healing. Enlightensment can only be provided by those who have the appropriate expertise and are involved. \"The Enlightenedness must be given orally. Only in addition can written documents be made available. If the doctor undertakes the procedure, the Enwareness must take place by a doctor. Consent must be made in a comprehensible and timely manner, so that the patient can make his decision about the consent well thought-out. \"To the patient, copies of documents which he has signed in connection with the Enighty or Consent are to be handed over to the patient. \"In general, the education of the patient does not require a single conversation, but rather a treatment-accompanied process. A successful Enlight has a positive effect, e.g. on compliance, tolerance [4]. The desire for Enlightening is significant in terms of experience [435]. Ideally, it leads to a joint participatory decision-making process (shared decision making; [440]). The information should be comprehensive, understandable and truthful. In particular, consideration should be given to the patient's need for information and the resilience of the patient. In any case, the doctor should clarify whether the information has arrived at the patient as intended. In the context of the information, further assistance should also be pointed out, especially to support by psycho-oncologists, pastoral care or self-help groups. Content, timing and duration of the education talks must be documented in the medical record. In doing so, standardised forms can be used, but these should be supplemented by hand according to the individual information situation. According to § 630f para. 2 BGB, the physician must document in the health records that he personally informs the patient 7.2 Patie Empfeh A Level of",

If an Enlightened Document was used, it should be attached to the files. If the Enighty Information was not given, because the patient had already been informed or did not do so on his own initiative, this should also be documented In the S3 guideline Palliative Medicine[441] and other organ guidelines of the guidance program Oncology, numerous aspects for communication with oncological patients have been developed. In the context of the revision of the S3, guideline Lung Carcinoma, it has been examined in particular which recommendations from the S 3 guideline on palliative medicine [441 ] apply to the patient group with a lung carcinoma. The recommendations have been modified regarding the specific characteristics of this patient group. Decision-making allows it to take place: • expression of empathy and active listening • direct and sensitive response to difficult topics • if possible, avoiding medical vocabulary, if necessary explanation of technical terms • strategies to improve understanding (repeat, summary of important information, use of graphics, etc.) • encouragement to ask questions • permission and encouragement to express feelings • provide further help Literature: Adapted by S3 guideline Mammacarcinoma 2018: there quoted primary sources: nce [442], [443],[444],.[445], (447] Consensus 7.2 Patie EK entenz centered communication 156 consensus-based statement tested 2024 The communicative competencies of the enlightening physicians can be improved by participating in a structured communication training.

People with a non-healable cancer prefer patient-centred communication [451], [452],[453], (454],.[455]. This is helpful in reducing anxiety and strengthening self-efficacy [456], (457], improving confidence in oncologists [458], and better compliance [459]. Physical and mental stress and problems can be better perceived and treated more effectively [454], {45555].\"Patient-center communication is characterized by the following characteristics • Active listening • Perception of emotions • Eruizing whether and how the patient wants to be informed about his decision [eligible], the patient's decision is not informed, and sincere conveying of this information • Eluating individual stress, problems and hardships • Continuous active reinsurance, whether or how messages are understood\" (eg. In particular, they underestimate the extent of their disease and overestimate the possibilities of healing [463], [466],[467],.[468]. When information is held back, this leads to an increase in anxiety and uncertainty in patients and families, as well as a lack of opportunity to prepare for the time of increased stress, disturbed communication in the family, and lack of trust between the affected person and the treatment team [469]. 7.3 Special EK EK zielle A Enlightenment Situations 157 \"Qualified training measures by competent and professional instructors provide a sheltered framework to promote communication skills and support the learning and development processes initiated by them [470], (471), [473] [474],, [465] [476], 477, [48] [44] Behaviour, [49] Behaviours [4] Begabebehavior, [78] Bege, [79] Begnehmer Begabenung, [43] Beguhrung, Competencies are improved, in particular, a better handling of emotions and an empathic attitude of the physicians is described [480], [481],[482],.[484]. A German study with lung cancer patients showed that a communication training of the doctors also has a patient-side benefit [485]: In an observational study 101 patients who had been newly informed about a lung cancer diagnosis were asked to remember and to be satisfied with diagnosis, therapy and therapy goal. The responses of the patients were compared with the information of the educating physicians. 37 doctors were trained with drama patients using the SPIKES protocol. The patients they informed (n=100) had significantly better knowledge (61 vs. 42%, p=0.009) about their therapy goal and their prognosis and were significantly more satisfied with the conversation about these contents (81 vs. 53%, p<0.001) than the patients of the observational trial, which had been informed by physicians without training [485 ]. As a restriction of these two studies, the two diagnostic groups were thus compared to the training groups of patients as a result of the possibility. Special Enlightenment Situations Diagnosis Communication Consensus-based recommendation examined 2024 The information about the disease and its course should be primarily provided by the treating physician. When discussing the information, the patient should be supported by all professional groups involved in the treatment. To this end, the state of the education process should be documented in a comprehensible manner. Consensence Consensivity-based Recommendation reviewed 2024 Prior to the information transmission, it is intended to ask with what knowledge, with which ideas, hopes and fears the patient enters into the conversation in connection with his illness. Conssensus 7.3 Specific EK EK ielle A Enlightening Situations 158 Consensual Recommendation examined 2023 Information should be gradually transmitted with regular reinsurance, whether and to what extent the patient has understood it.

Consensus Consensity-based recommendations examined 2021 Family members should be perceived and appreciated in their role as supporters and co-affected persons. They should be asked about their needs and, if necessary, encouraged to accept support offers. Consent Background As soon as the diagnosis of a lung carcinoma is secured, the patients should be informed by the patient about the patient's ability to express their feelings. The doctor should truthfully inform the patient without trivializing content; nevertheless, the hope of healing or alleviation should be given enough space. To this end, it is helpful to show a therapeutic perspective. \"The primary information is provided by the doctor, but the supporting support of the patient in his processing of the information is the task of all professional groups involved in the treatment. Therefore, the comprehensible documentation and team-related exchange about the patient's state of education and information are an important task. \"In clinical everyday life, the SPIKES model proposed by Buckman and Baile has proven itself to be a guide in many conversational situations [486]. It breaks down the conversation into six steps, which include the essential elements of the patients-centred conversation: • Setting: create suitable conversation frameworks • Perception: determine the patient ́s level of knowledge (perception) • Invitation: identify the patient`s information requirement • Knowledge transfer • Exploration of emotions: perceive the emotions and react with empathy • Strategy and Summary: plans and summarize [450] 3 use of appropriate settings to the patient. The patient and his family are in agreement. \"Knappe, clear statements without beautification, adapted to the patient's use of speech, prevent misconceptions and misconceptions [487], [488]. With short pauses during the conversation, with repeated queries and explanations, and with explicit encouragement on questions, one can rest assured how the patient has understood the messages [489],[490],.[491]. For detailed and detailed, unsolicited (about) information that the patient cannot process at the given time, more can contribute to an insecurity of the patient [492], [4] [493] [450] The treatment goal, curation or palliation, should be clarified. \"The emotional and spiritual dimension can be important resources for the patient. Let the doctor and the other occupational groups involved in the treatment facilitate the emotional and the spiritual experience of the patients – be it verbal or non-verbal – space, they support him effectively in the recovery of self-estimation and control, as well as in the preparation for new orientation. Preparing for content and goals, reflecting on one's own experience and structuring of the conversation will make it easier for the doctor to remain able to act and empathize [460], [487],[495]. In conjunction with an attitude of esteeming respect, sincerity and empathy towards the person, they increase the likelihood that the patient can trust the doctor that he does not feel dropped and can discover and use his own resources It may be necessary to allow a time interval between the educational discussion on diagnosis and the first therapy proposal for the participatory decision. \"For the patient, this involves a process of gradual inner approach to the new reality at his own pace, the doctors and other occupational groups involved in the treatment, with continuous willingness to support further discussions [489],.[499] [450] The conversational content in a potentially curative treatment situation is different from those in a palliative disease situation. In the palliatory treatment situation, the central desire of the patients for life extension should be explained in good quality of life or. Alternatives in treatment, e.g. in the context of participation in clinical trials, are to be explained. Also the side effects or late consequences of a treatment with their effects on the lifestyle and quality of life of the 7.3 EK zial A education situations 160 patients should be discussed. The right to obtain a second opinion should be pointed out and the realization supported. The possibilities of an oncological aftercare and rehabilitation after completion of treatment should also be addressed, as well as existing offers of psychooncological, spiritual and social legal support as wellas services by self-help groups. If necessary, appropriate contacts should be provided. Content of the education discussions should be besides the diagnosis and the therapeutic options also the prognosis. Most patients wish that the doctors fully clarify them and honestly describe the prognostication [467], [468],[501]. Communication oriented to the current needs, problem situations and preferences of patients (patient centering) has beneficial effects on treatment satisfaction, decision-making, mental stress and physical complaints [456], the disease progression of the disease, 496, the serious changes in the course of the patient. Conversations about serious changes in the course of the disease With regard to the education of patients and relatives about serious change in the progression of the illness, reference is made to the recommendations from Chapter 6.3 of the S3 guideline Palliative Medicine [450]. The basic principles of patient-centred communication [460], [461],[462] apply to the clarification of tumour recurrences after curative therapy or through failure or insufficient response to tumor-specific therapy in a palliative disease situation. \"Severe changes in disease progression due to the recurrence or progression of tumour disease, the failure to achieve tumour therapy or the near death confront patients with limitations of life and prospects and can trigger crisis-like experiences [490].\"[450] \"The treatment of patients in advanced disease phases with frequent transitions and border situations as well as the accompanying of their relatives places high demands on the communication and interaction involved in the treatment. Precautionary care planning (Advance Care Planning, ACP) Consensus-based recommendation reviewed 2024 Patients with non-healable lung carcinoma disease should receive the provision of a forward-looking care planning. Consensual agreement 7.3 Specific A Enlightenment situations 161 Consensuous recommendation examined 2024 Subject of the discussions on forward-thinking care planning should be: • Scope and limits of treatment in case of (illness) typical as well as frequent and possible scenarios and complications; • Individual preferences regarding care in the last phase of life, the place of care and death and, if applicable, the burial; • Designation of a precaution authority or suggestion of a care provider. Consent Background \"Precautional care planning\" describes a systematic, interprofessionally accompanied communication and implementation process between patients, relatives and relevant persons involved in the treatment of the patient. The process includes the best possible sensitivities, reflection, documentation and possibly clinical implementation of treatment preferences of patients with regard to future hypothetical clinical scenarios. (life prolongation and/or quality of life in a palliative situation) and the treatment decisions based on it (the treatment of cancer, emergencies and crises), but also on preferences and priorities in the remaining lifetime, e.g. with regard to lifestyle, place of life, location of death or care arrangements. Less aggressive therapies in the last week of life were associated with a higher quality of life for both patients and mourning relatives [204], [506],[507]. Discussions on the contents of the ACP were linked to a significantly increased rate of preference-oriented therapy [508]. It requires special attention and awareness about the meaning of these conversational contents to offer the patient and his/her relatives an open conversation about dying in all dimensions early and repeatedly during the course of the illness. Talks about death/death wishes should also be made proactively [515], [516]. Most patients want to talk about issues of life's end [517],[518],.[519], (520]. If patients do not address these content independently, it should not be assumed that these contents do not want to be addressed. The patient's need for information and discussion should be actively and empathically questioned. The time point of discussion in the course and the depth of information should be determined by the patients and their relatives [5 17]. Doctors should speak in clear words about the end of life with the patients or their relatives. It is therefore recommended that words such as \"dying down\" and \"death\" of those involved in the treatment should be expressed in a more sensitive and situatively appropriate manner [522]. Especially if patients themselves are able to learn to die with a real meaning and to die. Especially when patients themselves suspect that death and death are of real importance to them, they can experience comfort and safety by not leaving them alone with this topic. Instruments such as conversational guidelines can be helpful in ensuring that these contents are not ignored [523], [524]. In daily life, different scores have been used (Cumulative Illness Rating Score – Geriatric; Charlson Comorbidity Index; Simplified Comorbidity Score). The analyses show that: • A higher age should not benefit from a resection without relevant comorbidity as much as younger • In terms of radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy, an unfavourable comorbidities score is predictive for an adverse outcome (but not a higher age) but the indication for radiochemy therapy is not only influenced by the comorbidety score but also by age [527] • Elderly patients – regardless of the comorobidity profile – receive chemotherapy as a younger one [5]. In view of the importance of 2 consultations d the early integration of palliative care 164 Comorbidity or the activity profile in daily life should be examined prospectively. Concept of the early inclusion of palliatative care Introduction The early and routine integration of Palliative care is seen as a combination of oncological and palliativ medical care in a treatment concept - depending on the phase of cancer, continuously adapted to the needs and pressures of the patients and their relatives in the course [500]. This is a cooperative and non-competent nature of the departments by the addition of a further discipline and the management of the therapy by the primary treating pneumologist or oncologist. The concept of the premature integration of Palliative Care in patients with non-healable lung carcinoma includes a complex supply of medical and communicative competence with the aim of providing an appropriate patient situation and limiting adequate therapy recommendations to the patient. The patient's situation of individual and appropriate treatment recommendations to achieve rapid symptom control and to improve the quality of life and significantly limiting concomitant symptoms through predictive care planning (ACP – see chapter 6.6). Several positive studies have demonstrated a significant effect on the early integration of palliative care to quality of living and depression in patients with metastatic lung cancer [500], [530],[531],.[532], McCartney: In addition, a reduction in oncological therapies, an extended period between the last chemotherapy and death and thus the period of hospice follow-up, an improved understanding of the prognosis, a lower burden of relatives and a significant improvement in overall survival could be demonstrated. Furthermore, more advance prescriptions regarding reanimation situations were created and fewer patients were included in the emergency intake or hospital [533], < 534], > 536, <537]. As a side effect, the early inclusion of pallitase structures was also reduced in the case of early exposure to disease. The symptom load is high and often diagnostic. The median survival time of the overall group is also only –1222-- 18 months for palliative chemotherapy. Compared to a period of 5 years (2007 to 2009), overall survival rates for NCLC increased slightly (men: +0.8%, women: +0.6%) [540] [541]. Thus, maintaining or improving the quality of life is an essential therapy/intervention goal. The recognition of the benefits of an early integrative concept between oncological standard therapy and palliativ treatment has already led to 8.2 concept of early integration of palliatory medical care in the United States to offer oncologic and pneumological professional lung cancer patients at an advanced stage early palliatial medical co-care [494], [542]. This concept is also recommended in the S3 leitli for Pallliativmedizin [450].",

Consensus-based recommendation 2024 Structured palliatory care was not integrated in the decision-making process. is the first tumor entity for which the benefit of early inclusion of palliative medicine in treatment is scientifically proven [500], [504],[533],.[543]. In tried and tested models for implementation, this integration takes place within a few weeks after diagnosis of an incurable stage of disease [500 ], [545], (546], (547], and [548]. 2 concentrates d the early integration of paliative medical care 167 The cooperating palliativ care needs to be carried out by qualified palliatory medical professionals in all Palliative Medically relevant dimensions (physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs). It must be documented. Should a high complexity be identified in these consultations, the specialized palliary care should be activated. The involvement of specialised palliate care professionals must be oriented to the needs of the patient, but should also take into account defined issues of availability [549]. Multidimensionality suggests that a multi-professional approach to palliamental care is useful. The symptoms and stresses of palliative therapy are identified and treated in particular when patients are actively, routinely and structuredly surveyed [550]. From the experience that general recommendations are not sufficient, criteria specific to diagnosis were developed by Gärtner et al for the optimal timing of palilliative interventions for various malignancies [551], [552]. In lung cancer patients the following criteria were defined in this working group: each new disease at metastatic stage and each inoperable recurrence. Here, following the introduction of the defined trigger criteria, positive indications for successful previous integration of paliliative care [551,] were identified as primary triggers for the integration of specialised palliatory care were identified by Ferrell et al. [8]: (1) Surprise question: You would not be surprised if the patient died within the next 12 months? (Antwort: No), (2) frequent hospital admissions, (3) inpatient instruction due to difficult to control physical or mental symptoms, (4) complex care requirements, (5) increasing weight loss (6) complex social stress [553] to improve the use of the palliativ response to the clinical response. The evaluation of the quality of care at the end of life by the oncological centre can also increase the early use of PC palliative care [548]. As regards the effect of early integration of palliativ care in patients with a lung carcinoma, four prospective, randomised studies could be identified as part of a systematic research conducted by the guideline group [500], [504],[543],.[545] (see Table 22). The studies demonstrate statistically significant effects on quality of life and depression in patients suffering from metastatic lung cancer [500\", [504), [544] and [54545 ]. In addition, in one study a significant reduction in unnecessary chemotherapy (60 days prior to the end) [533]) and in two studies a significant improvement in survival time [504], is expected to take place in each organ-centre at least once in a pre-existing period of treatment. In tumor conferences, questions often arise in palliative treatment situations which, in addition to initiating tumor-specific measures, should also be the reason for palliativmedizinisches Konsil. Thus, the tumor conference also provides the starting point for a structured inclusion of palliatiative medicine, e.g. in the sense of early integration in tumor stage IV. In the context of a systematic research of the guideline group, four prospective, randomized studies could be identified [50 [504], [543],[545] (see Table 22).

For central tumours, adjusted dose regimens with at least 4 fractions and a BED10 of 100-135 Gy should be used. Of these, very centrally located tumours are excluded in the proximal bronchial tree or in close relationship to the oesophageal system. In this case, a lung steotaxia with strict dose limitation of the corresponding risk organs should be performed at least 8. Strong Consensus Background 8.8 to 8.13 Limited resections include both wedge resection and anatomical segment resection. They are used to remove smaller tumours in the pulmonary periphery and require intralobary resection of pulmonary parenchyme at a possible too short distance from the tumour with the risk of incomplete resection (R1/R2) and local relapse. 3 Stadi ium I/ /II 172 In a current controlled randomised study comparing lobectomy and limited resection in stage I, the equivalence of limited reections such as anatomal segment reection and atypical wedge reection compared to lobecotomy in nodal negative T1a/b tumours with respect to 5-year survival and recurrence rates [587] could be demonstrated. Other studies underline the functional advantage over lobecontomy [556], [557] or the equivalence to lobectomie in relation to lobomy in case of long-term resection, no longer than 555. Patients who do not tolerate lobectomy due to their comorbidity should be given limited resection. However, it should be noted that atypical wedge resection should only be performed in peripheral tumours of less than 2 cm in the outer third of the parenchyme mantle and secured N0 status, whereby the resection distance to the tumor should be greater than the tumor diameter. Hospitalletality after limited reection is reported in a range of 0 to 6 percent. The 30-day hospital fatality after lobecotomy is reported with 3 percent in a ranges of 0 through 9 percent [561], [560] (Evidence Grade 3b). Cuff resection versus Pneumonectomy In tumours requiring pneumonectomie due to the central seat, the cuff resection is an alternative to pneumorectomy. Bronchus cuff reections have been introduced for the first time to obtain a pneumonic resection with as much healthy lung resection as possible. Cuff resection allows a parenchyme-sparing approach and offers itself as an alternative to pneumonectomy, provided that a tumor-free margin of the deposition levels can be achieved under rapid cut conditions. There are no randomised-controlled studies comparing pneumorectomy with cuff resection. Systematic reviews have been included in this recommendation comparing the cuff reections with the alternative of a pneumonectomy in curative resection of non-small cell lung carcinoma. Two overviews have been found that include cuff reessions with an alternative of pneomonectomie in curatory resections of nonsmall cell pulmonary carcinomas [528], [411]. The one review work summarises work that includes cuff retractions even in restricted lung function, the other review work only includes studies in which patients with cuffresections may also include pneumone pneumations, and therefore the first study resection was assessed in terms of frequency. The mean 5-year survival rate after cuff resection in stage II was 41%. The local recurrence rate after Cuff reection was an average of 3 stadi ium I/ /II 173 The second review work is a meta-analysis comparing 860 Cuff Resections with 746 Pneumonectomyes from 12 studies [411]. In this work there is a significant difference in the treatment-related tumour stages between the two groups (p=0.001). The average 5 year survival rates were comparable in both groups (51.4% in Cuffresections vs. 49.1% in Pneu monectomies). However, the average median survival time was significantly lower in patients with Pneumorectomy than in patients suffering from CuffResections (70 mo. vs. 50 mo.; p=0.02). In the second review study, letality is also more closely considered, but not taken into account the morbidity. The advantage of cuff resections is the maintenance of healthy lung tissue, which affects the median survival time but has no influence on the 5 year survival rate. The lethality after cuff reectomie is comparable to that of standard lobectomy and tends to be less than that of pneumonectomy. The cuff reection is, despite a slightly higher local recurrence rate, an alternative to pneumorectomy not only in functionally restricted patients, since it prevents the specific complications and late consequences of pneumonectoxia by parenchyme retention and was associated with a significantly longer median survival period. Stereotactic radiotherapy in stages I and IIA Approximately 12 – 25 % of patients with NSCLC are functionally inoperable due to comorbidities [577], [565]. The lung steotaxia (SBRT) achieves high rates of local control in early stages I or IIA due to over 79 – 95 % and an early therapeutic success rate in the pre-species of 82 years. The implementation of SBRT requires appropriate equipment and experience of the centre for high-precision techniques, as well as demanding quality assurance. For body stereotaxies, typically dedicated stereotactic storage devices such as individually moldable and form-stabilized vacuum systems are used. In addition, the target volume definition requires imaging control of the respiratory excursion of the tumor by breath-triggered 4D computer tomography series in irradiation position. Detailed standards for target volume definitions, dose prescription and medical-physical quality assurance in the high-precision radiation therapy of lung carcinoma are defined, among other things, in guidelines or position papers of the specialist companies EORTC [591], DEGRO [562] and AAPM [566]. Therefore, the dosage information given below is usually the reference dose encompassing the target volumes. The actual dose distribution is defined by further parameters such as the target dose, the calculation algorithm and the planning technique. For SBRT there are a large number of clinical studies in which very different dose or fractionation regimens were used. There are clinically sufficiently validated dose prescriptions that show a clinically meaningful relationship between tumour control and adverse reactions. BED10 is significant as a measure of the biologically effective dose and for the definition of a therapeutic target range. In a retrospective Japanese study in 257 patients treated with SBRI with NSCLC in stage I, a significantly lower local recurrence rate was observed with a BED 10 ≥ 100 Gy vs. Bed10 < 100 Gy (8.4% vs. 42.9%, p [578] Stahl et al. conducted a greater retrospective, multicenter analysis of the SBrit of NSClc in stage T1-2 N0 [567]. The higher BED-10 ≥ 105 Gy (n = 581) vs.BED10 < 105 Gy(n=166) was also associated with a significantly improved median survival rate in both groups. Tumor localisation was observed in a prospective study in which doses of 3x 20 Gy (T1-Tumore) and 3x 22 Gy ( T2-Tumore), respectively, were applied at very high doses [569]. \"In a retrospective analysis of 63 patients with central tumor localisation or tumours near the pericardium or mediastinum treated with 8x 7.5 Gy, all tumours within a 2 cm hem around the proximal bronchial tree were classified as \"centrally\" and there was no excessive toxicity compared to 445 patients with aggressive dosed SBRT of tumours in peripheral location (3x 20 g or 5x 12 g) [570]. Both groups had comparable local control after three years (92.6 % for central vs. 90.2% for peripheral location, p = 0.9). In a dose finding study of RTOG for central location, the highest dose level (n=33) was achieved with 5x12 g. (315 patients with central tumours) confirms that SBRT can also be performed in central locations with moderate risk when selecting adjusted dose regimens and taking into account defined normal tissue boundaries [572]. However, the \"ultracentral\" tumor localisation, i.e. the overlapping of target volume with the proximal bronchial tree, or the tumors adjacent to the oesophagus, are excluded. For such patients, however, the feasibility of an SBRI with attenuated dose regimen at high volume centers should be individually assessed. A dose commonly used for peripheral sites is the administration of 3x 15 Gy as recommended and specified by the AG Stereotaxia of the DEGRO [562], while taking into consideration an adequate corridor in the choice of BED, alternative dosing schemes can be used in principle. The overall favorable long-term compatibility of SBIR in peripheral sites was confirmed in a cross-centre analysis of 505 patients [573]. Pneumonitis ≥ II was observed in only 2 % of the cases, in 8 ribs. A Pneumonitis ≥ Grade II was only observed in 2%, rib fractures were observed in 8% of cases. Dose and volume related risk of pain syndrome in the chest wall was 20.1% in 140 patients with SBRT for peripheral tumours, the median duration up to its occurrence was 12.6 months [574]. 3 Stadi ium I/ /II A greater number of retrospective and prospective studies include patients in whom SBRI was performed without prior histological protection. This approach is justified in justified exceptional cases when, in case of massively restricted functional situation of the patia, the pneumothorax risk of CT-controlled puncture is disproportionate. In addition, imaging criteria must clearly indicate lung carcinoma, e.g. as defined in a prospective Canadian study, the CT-based size progression at an interval of at least one month and/or FDG-PET-positive findings and a corresponding recommendation by a thoraxological tumor board was defined in respect of H7. The two subgroups did not differ significantly with regard to median overall survival and local control for 3 years [576]. By means of validated diagnostic models involving the FDG-PE (19), there was no significant difference in the probability of malignancy (92.5 % vs 94.8%) in a post-hoc analysis for patients who were only clinically diagnosed compared to those with pathological diagnosis. Comparison of SBRT and resection in functionally borderline patients The criteria for reliable estimation of operability – with respect to different resectional dimensions are described in chapter 6.7 of this guideline. In the ACOSOG Z4032 study, there were no prospective studies comparing SBRI and (limited resection of functionally restricted operable patients). Palma et al. were treated with a high risk of lobectomy [585] in the study. With both modalities, local control rates of ≥ 89% and a comparable 1 year or 3-year survival could be achieved. However, by means of propensity score matching, it could be shown that long-term survival in patients treated with parenchyme-saving surgery was higher than that of patients with stereotactic radiation therapy [590], the results of several retrospective studies comparing SBRT and limited resection are, overall, not clearly and apparently, subject to a pronounced selection bias [580], [581],[582],.[584]. In these therapeutic borderline situations, beyond the recommendation of the tumor conference, the patient is adequately involved in decision-making regarding surgical and radiation therapeutic aging.",

A sufficient cardiopulmonary reserve is required. Lobectomy including systematic dissection of ipsilateral lymph nodes is the recommended surgical measure. In rare cases, pneumonectomy is necessary. In certain tumour localization, a cuff resection is permitted, provided a sufficient safety margin can be ensured. In a current randomized multicenter study, for tumours ≤ 2 cm in stage 11.2, anatomic segment resection of the lobectopomie in relation to overall survival was confirmed [607]. This could be confirmed in two more randomised restories and thus only in the same group. In the case of tumours less than or equal to 2 cm and localization in the outer third of the parenchyme mantle, the recommended standard resection form remains the lobectomy for invasively secured N0 status and a resection distance from the tumor to justify greater than its own diameter. However, further parameters should be included in the decision-making process for sublobary resection: 1. The ratio between the milk glass content and the solid proportion of the tumor in the imaging (GGO). Tumors with a milk glass portion in the sectional imaging have a better prognosis than completely solid tumours [608]. 2. Histological evidence of tumour cell dissection over the alveolar spaces (STAS). Adenocarcinomas with reproved STAS-positivity have a significantly increased relapse risk in the event of sublobular resection compared to STAS negative adenocaromas [609]. The 5-year survival rate for the postoperative IA/ IB II stage is also defined as 8 to 6 %. It is also referred to as perioperative lethality. Operation morbidity defines undesirable consequences of surgery within 30 days postoperatively. It can be divided into minor and serious consequences. A systematic survey [528] summarises 15 studies [529], [631],[632],.[633], (635), [636], [...] [637], ...638], 639], and [641]; [642] and [561] and a further 4 articles [597], 598, [599] [600] show an average lettality of 3.5 % (minimum 1 %, maximum 7.6 %) for open surgery in lung carcinoma (minime 2b) with increasing age. This resulted in a further review of 37 studies [605] (evidence level 2b). The highest degree of morbidity is found in extensive resections such as pneumonectomy (evidence grade 3b) [602]. The average 30-day mortality for open resection in lung cancer is 3.5% and the average 30 day morbidness is 30%. Background 8.16 The development of minimally invasive video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical technique (VATS/RATS) has strongly influenced the diagnosis and treatment of patients with unclear pulmonary herds. For example, the VATS/RATIS is now used as a standard method for round herd clarification. In addition, however, the FATS/RaTS is increasingly used for lung carcinoma resection. Here, in particular, articles were taken into account that examine the role of the VATZ/RATES lung resection with regard to oncological radicality, technical feasibility and safety. Few articles were also applied to the cost-efficiency of the VITS/Ratis resection compared to conventional open lung reection. Furthermore, it is noticeable that the various VETS techniques require a clear definition of lung response. Only a few publications respond to the quality of the required lymph node dissection. Thus, the publications are hardly comparable. To verify the effectiveness of the VATS lobectomy compared to the open lobecomy at stage I/II, two systematic overviews [616], [610] and four randomized controlled studies [611],[613],.[615] were included. All studies examined patients in stage I and II and analyzed the VAtes lobektomy with open lung resections for long-term survival and occurrence of relapses. The 5-year survival rate after VATS resection compared to open lodecomy in non-small cell lung carcinoma was 72% vs. 67%. No difference in the 5-year DFS. In addition, after VATS lobectomie, there was a lower incidence of Reziliven 15% vs. 19% [616). (Evidenzgrad 2a) All of the above studies showed that there was no decrease in the incidence of pain during the period of surgery in 2019. While Palade described a longer period of surgery with VATS compared to thoractomie, Long 2017 and Yang 2019 reported a shorter period of operation with VaTS compared with thoractomy. Compared to conventional open lobectomy in tumour stage I/II, VATS/RATS lobektomy appears to be at least as safe surgical technique with tending to be less morbidity and lethality. It is important that systematic lymphadenectomy is performed in VATS techniques, as carefully as in open operations. Survival analyses show a tendency to improve survival rate compared to open lung resections, with the experience of VATS-resection certainly being a separate group. Further evaluation requires more prospectively randomized studies. Data on the use of SBRT in operable stage I as an alternative to lobecotomy are limited. The cumulative local control 5 years after SBRT (median BED10: 116 Gy) was 92% for T1 tumours and 73 for T2 tumours. The 5-year overall survival was 72% and 62% respectively (Stadium IA and IB respectively). Two attempts were made to investigate the effectiveness of SBRI in prospective randomised studies compared to lobectomy: the STARS study and the ROSEL study. The combined data of these two studies were published after both were discontinued due to poor recruitment [645]. A total of 58 patients were evaluated, 31 of whom received SBrit and 27 patients were operated on. Illuminated and operated patients were well balanced, but 8 irradiated patients from the ROSEL study did not receive histological assurance. Patients treated with SBIR showed a more favourable actuary 3-year survival than the operated patients (95% vs 79%, p = 0.037); the estimated recurrence-free survival was 08% after the overall BRT. [586], [646],[604] although based on popensity-matched cohort studies, the benefit for the overall survival and less relapses of the patients operated on is not convincing in this context due to the low number of cases (evidence grade 2a). Background 8.17 The most important factors in the assessment of the form of lymphadenectomy to be favored are survival, recurrence rate and morbidity. The systematic lymphaderectomy, as described for the first time by Naruke in 1976, is compared with the lymph node sampling of tumour-prospective lymph nodes. 3 Stadi ium I/I II 181 Studies were found only prospectively randomized including studies which compared systematic lymph adenectomie with a lymph node sample in curative resection of non-small cell lung carcinomas. A prospectively-random study compared the systematic lymphaectomy with a tumor node sample of 4 weeks. 98) the 5-year survival rate was increased with 82% vs. 58% significant by systematic lymphadenectomy [621], [620],[647] (p=0.01). An intention to treat analysis was not presented (evidence level 2b). The other 2 prospective studies showed no significant survival effect of systematic lymph adenectomia. A meta-analysis of the above studies showed that there is no significant heterogeneity between the studies and therefore a pooled analysis could be performed. This showed that overall survival was significantly better after systemic lymph adentomie than after lymph node sampling [648] (evident level 1b). For the accuracy of lymph node sagging there is a prospective, non-randomised [619] (evidence grade 2b) and a prospective randomized study [618] (equence level 1B). The comparison of complications after systematic lymphadenectomy and lymph node sampling shows no significant differences (38% vs. 47%) (evidence level 1b) [620]. If the specific complications that can be caused by a systematic lymph adenectomie (after bleeding, chylothorax, recurrensparese) are considered in detail, then there are tending but not significantly more complications after systemic lymph adentomie [621]. However, another prospectively randomized study showed significantly more complications after systematic Lymphadenectemy (27% vs. 3%) [621]. None of the three studies found differences in the lethality between lymph aderectomy or lymph node sample [622], [623],[620 ], [647] (evident level 1 b). Since the tendentially increased complications after a systematic lymphadectomy are well controlled and due to the systematic lymph Adenectopomie respondency is not recommended in any stage. Regardless of T-factor and tumor localisation, the dissection should always be complete and non-selective. Different names, terms, contents of the lymphotent dissection and different allocation of the same lymph node compartments, however, make it difficult to assess the literature on lymph node evaluation. Background 8.18 Pulmonary carcinomas with breast wall infiltration are among the T3 tumours. A special subset is the pancoast tumors, which require a different multimodal therapy than the other lung carcinoma with breast walls infiltration. Therefore, in this chapter the pancost tumors are not included 3 stadiium I/ /II 182 and are listed separately in chapter 8.4. The systematic overview of the literature presented here summarizes exclusively breast wall filtrations by lung cancer. Approximately 10 % of the resectable, non-small cell lung cancers indicate a breast wall infection of [528]. Approximately 60 % of these patients have a pN0 lymph node status and approximately 40 % a pNC status of lymph nodes. 40 % for all pT3 tumours with breast wall infiltration, 44 % for pN0 patients and 26 % for PN1 patients (evidence grade 3a) [528]. This review showed a trend towards a better survival rate in the studies, which analysed only patients with R0 resections compared to other studies that included patients with r1 resection. In a further systematic review of 4 studies, the 5-year survival rate after incomplete resection was 7%, compared to 27% for R0 Resection (evident grade 3b) [624]. Therefore, long-term survival seems to depend on radicality. Two retrospective studies [625], [626] have shown that in patients with complete resection (R0) the depth of breast wall filtrations was not a prognostic parameter (evence grade 3B). In addition, breast wall resection technique also appears to play a role in fewer cases of aggressive resection, but was not considered to be a more aggressive exercise. No survival differences between patients with an en-bloc full-wall breast wall resection or a less aggressive procedure if complete resection is achieved [629] (evidence level 3b). Regarding the aggressiveness of the surgical procedure, all studies do not show a significant difference in lethality (evident grade 3b), the radicality of chest wall reection is a significant prognostic factor (evence level 3). The depth of breast wall infiltration could influence the prognosis, with a greater role in surgical technique, which only allows extrapleural lyse in pleurainvasion without ribinfiltrating, and requires full wall resection in case of deeper infiltration (evance level 3B). Background 8.19-8.21 In case of incomplete resection (R1/R2 situation), however, further re-resection should be recommended in the case of non-completive resection in the course of treatment. In principle, however, the further procedure should be discussed in the Thorax-Oncological Tumor Board and the further treatment options (e.g. re-resection, radiotherapy, systemic therapy) should be determined after weighing the benefit and risk for the patient.",

The primary endpoint was response rate to chemotherapy was 35.4%, HR for PFS and OS was 0.7 (95% CI 05-0,97, p=0.003) and control arm was increased in the course of one or more years. The surgery was not associated with statistically significantly increased mortality or morbidity [651]. The second prospectively randomised operation was the only one that compared three arms of induction chemotherapy + surgery against surgery + adjuvant chemotherapy against sole surgery. This study also makes a statement in particular about the relevance of the therapy to induction therapy vs. adjuvant therapy [652]. In the preoperative arm, 90.4% (180 / 201) of patients received 3 cycles of induction therapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin. However, in the adjuvart therapy arm, only 60.9% (128/210) received 3 courses of planned adjuvenous therapy. The surgery rates, mortality and morbidities rates were identical in the three arms. No difference in survival was observed in the overall group, however, with predominantly stage I patients (75.1 %), for which adjuvelant therapy was also not shown as a survival advantage (5 years of disease-free survival 38.3% vs. 32.1%, HR 0,9 p. Two metaanalyses examined the importance of induction therapy and surgery vs. surgery. In the metaanalysis of Song et al [659], 13 randomized studies with a total of 3224 patients were considered. HR for the OS was 0.84 (95% CI 0.77-0.92, p<0.0001). In a subgroup analysis of patients at stage III, HR was 0.84, (95%CI 0.75-0.95, p<0.005). Subgroup analyses for stage I and II were not possible due to missing OS data for the groups in most studies. 3 Stadi ium I/ /II 185 The second metaanalysis included 15 studies with 2385 patients. These could be seen as HR of 0.87 (95%C 0.78-0.96, p=0.007) for overall survival. The absolute effect of overall survival was reported at 5% after 5 years (40% vs. 45%). No differences could be observed in the type of the platinum partner. The PFS was also significantly more favourable with a HR of 0,85 (95% ci 0.76,94, p. The side effects of the therapy were not evaluated in meta-analysis [653]. These analyses show that induction therapy with chemotherapy alone provides comparable benefits in survival as adjuvant therapy. By means of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy, the benefit in LACE metaa analysis is 5% after 5 years, the meta-analyse for preoperative chemotherapy also shows a benefit of 5% after five years. Thus, we have an option of postoperative as well as preoperative administration with positive effect on long-term survival with cispplatin-based chemotherapy. Nevertheless, as described above, the patient collective is of course not completely comparable due to the different staging tests and data. With modern preoperative staging such as PET-CT and detailed EBUS, patient selection should be increasingly approximated. The therapy decision in the multidisciplinary tumor board for patients in stage II, in particular the decision to perform primary surgery or preoperative chemototherapy should be taken based on present risk factors. 1. Non-R0-Sparable II-Rection (mostly) In patients with a realistic risk of pneumonectomy or advanced surgery, these patients who are at risk of postoperative wound healing disorders and therefore could be delayed or impossible to receive adjuvant chemotherapy should prefer pre-operative chemotherapy. 5. Certain comorbidities can contribute particularly to this goal 6. In patients who have difficult compliance to assess, pre-operational chemotherapy would be preferable in these patients. The reasons for deciding on one or other approach should be well documented in the tumor conference. It should be noted that due to the higher therapeutic relevance in induction, more patients benefit from the system component than in adjuvant setting. Background neoadjuvante checkpoint inhibitor therapy with or without combination with chemotherapy Various studies have been conducted in the neoadjuvent checkpoint inhibitors therapy followed by complete resection both in the sole neoadyuvant and in the peripoertive setting. These results of the Phase III study have now been published [655]. Here, 3 Stadi ium I/ /II 186 patients in stages IB, II and IIIA were randomized to preoperative chemoimmunotherapy (Platindoublette + Nivolumab) followed by definitive surgery versus preoperative chemotherapy alone followed by definite surgery. Event-free survival was significantly cheaper in the arm with preoperative Chemoimune therapy (median EFS 31.6 months versus 20.8 months; p = 0.005, FR 0.63). Also in the overall survival, a significant benefit for chemoinmuno therapy (medium survival in both arms was not yet achieved; HR 0.57, p = 0.08) was not reached. For the previous stage IB and II, the data of this study are not yet conclusive, since the number of patients in stage Ib/II was only 65 patients in the arms with chemomuno treatment and 62 patients in their arms with sole preoperatively chemotherapy (after titulation before TFF) or 0,4. The benefit was particularly pronounced as for patients with PD-L1 > or = 1% TPS (HR 0.41), 1-49% TPS(HR 0.58) and < or = 50% TPS (‘HR 0.24). Data on overall survival are not yet valid and final for most subgroup analyses. Data concerning the difference between cisplatin-based induction and carboplatin-based Induction are not valid due to the small and unspecified subgroup analysis. The approval of nivolumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for neoadjuvant treatment of resectable, non-small cell lung carcinoma with tumour cell PD- L1 expression ≥ 1% is not possible in adults with high risk of recurrence by the EMA in June 2023. Data from the neoadjurvant arm of the checkmate 816 for neoadejuvantic, chemotherapy-free therapy with Ipilimumab and Niperiviral in combination were not presented in all studies for the first time in December. In the AEGEAN study, 802 patients with recessable NSCLC (Stadium II-IIIB; N2, 8. TNM classification) received 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without durvalumab in order to then follow a 1-year maintenance period with durvalumab/placebo after complete resection. Patients with expected pneumonectomy could not be included. Event-free survival (EFS) was significantly improved in durvalab (hazard ratio 0.68; 12 months EFS 73.4% versus 64.5%). Also, the rate of complete pathological response was significantly higher in the durvalumab arm (17.2% versus 4.3%). Patients of 62 patients with documented EGFR or ALK alteration were not considered in these analyses [657]. In the study, placebo-type II and placebo-ranged subjects with Tbrombrium were 797 complete subjects with placebo-level cycles. The study had two primary endpoints: event-free survival and overall survival. In the interim analysis after a median follow-up of 25.2 months, event- free survival was improved from 40.6% to 62.4% at 24 months. 8.3 Stadi ium I/II 187 (hazard ratio 0.58). The addition of pembrolizumab also increased the rate of complete pathological remissions from 4.0% to 18.1%. At ESMO Congress 2023, the second primary endpoint, overall survival, was also presented, which was also markedly improved for the pembralizumab arm in a follow-ups of 36.6 months (hárid ratio 0.72; 3-year survival 71.3% versus 64.0%). A further phase III study (CheckMate 77T) investigated 4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy with nivolumab/placebo plus chemotherapy were currently exposed to complete resection and 1 year later adjuvanted II with Nibency. The results presented at ESMO 2023 are not yet available as a full publication.Recommendations for the future development of therapy In the context of the investigation of new, targeted drugs, the preoperative examination seems promising, since tissue profiles and possibly specific tissue markers could be detected using pre- and post-therapeutic tissue withdrawals. 8.3 Stage I/ Recommendationg A Level of Evidence",

In the current 8th classification, for example, tumors with a size of between 4 and 5 cm (T2b) and N0 status are no longer classified as stage IB but as IIA. Three randomized phase III studies observed a significant increase in survival by adjuvant chemotherapy with an increase in 5-year survival rate of between 4.1 % and 15 % (HR 0.69 – 0.86). Furthermore, in these studies a significant prolongation of tumour-free survival time was observed with an increased 5-year rate of tumour free survival of between 5.1 % and 12% (HR 0.6 – 0.88) [68], in 2 metaanalyses, a significant rise in survival rate by 4% - 4.2 % (H 0.87 – 0.89) was not confirmed by an extension of the chemotherapy period of over 660. However, no prolongation of survival time was observed by adjuvant chemotherapy, but a significant prolongation in tumour-free survival time in favour of adjuvant chemotherapy [674], [675],[683]. The positive effect of adjunct chemotherapy was observed in collectives with patients in stage IB, II and IIIA distinctly (i.e. surgically diagnosed mediastinal lymph node in case of inconspicuous cytological/histological or imaging preoperative mediastental diagnosis). Unexplained is the efficacy of adjurant chemotherapy in stage EB [681],.[666]. Subgroup analyses from phase III studies showed no significant prolonging of survival period in stage III. Explorative analyses initially indicated that possibly patients with tumours ≥ 4 cm in diameter might have a survival advantage in carrying out adjuvy chemotherapy [682], however, [684]. In a long-term analysis of a randomized study conducted exclusively in stage IT, a significant effect of survival of chemotherapy on survival could not be confirmed in the course of survival. However, a significant prolongation of progression-free survival from 78 to 89 months (p = 0.03) was confirmed by the meta-analysis of pignon with a significant extension of stage II survival (HR 0.83) and completely recessed IIIA (HR0.83), but not in stage IA (H 1.41) or IB (HR 0.92) [682]. In contrast, the results of a randomised phase II study with significant prolongations of both tumour-free (p=0.02) and overall survival (5-year survival rate: 45% versus 63%, p=0.04) [685] and a single-centre randomized phase III study also showed a significant increase in tumour- free (P=0.0001) and overall lifetime (5-annual survival rate): 42% versus 62%, p = 0.02) [679]. A meta-evaluation of 8447 patients from 34 studies showed a 4% improvement in overall survival after 5 years (hazard ratio 0.86) for an adjuvant resection of 13 weeks of 4 months of 4 weeks of 24 hours of 4 hours of 48 hours of 3 hours of 24 minutes of 4 days of 4 times of 4 minutes of 3 months of 3 minutes of 6 hours of 8 hours of 2 hours of 6 months of 8 minutes of 8 months of 6 minutes of 7 hours of 10 hours of 9 hours of 12 hours of 5 hours of 11 hours of 14 hours of 1 hours of 7 minutes of 5 of 4 or 4 hours more of 4 of 4 and 8 hours more. Improvement of the 5© Oncology Guide Programme - Lung Carcinoma - 3.0 - March 2024 3 Stadi ium I/ /II 191 Annual Survival Rate by 4%) [664]. Another meta-analysis with data from a total of 11107 patients from 47 studies confirmed these results ([663]). In the largest, positive studies on adjuvant chemotherapy, cisplatin-containing chemotherapys were performed. 65% of patients received vinorelbin as a combination partner. Due to different toxicity, the median dose intensity of cispabine was 80% of the planned 100 mg/m2 and 50% - 60% of the scheduled 25-30 mg/ m2 for vinorelbine [680], [681],[666]. Incompatibilities leading to a significant dose reduction of chemotherapy in the NCIC JBR.10 study were not reported in elderly patients, patients with Z.n. pneumectomie and women [686] in another study. Another prospective study, not yet fully published, was the overall survival in 1278 patients with pathological stage I (8th TNM classification) improved by adjuvant chemotherapy only in patients with risk factors (age ≥70 years; invasive component > 2 cm; visceral pleural involvement; lymphatic or vascular invasion) [687]. Based on the current data, cisplatin-based chemotherapy is recommended, with the greatest evidence for the combination with vinorelbin. The starting dose for cispabine should be 75 – 80 mg/ m2. The mortality associated with chemotherapy is in the range of 1 – 1.5%. However, the combination of cispplatin and pemetrexed showed a similar overall survival (less severe febrile neutropenia, neutropaenia and anaemia) in 804 patients with patological stage II-IIIA, non-squamous NSCLC, with a higher degree of tolerability (less serious neutropeneia, newtropenic disease and early anaemia). A careful risk balance should be performed in patients with Z. n. pneumectomy, as in these patients the risk of complication was particularly high [[681], [686]. Taking into account the cardiac load from the obligant pre- and posthydration, modified schedules of cisplatin administration, such as those chosen in the JBR.10 study, should be favored on days 1 and 8 (40 – 50 mg/m2). In a prospectively randomised study, four chemotherapy regimens were used in combination with cispabine +/- bevacizumab. No difference in survival could be detected between vinorelbins, gemcitabine, docetaxel, paclitaxel and pemetrexed. From the data it is to be deduced that in adjuvant therapy all combination partners authorised for palliative therapy can be used [688]. Adjuvante chemotherapy with a clitaxels and pemetaxed. This effect was confirmed by two meta-analyses, where data at stage IB is not consistent. 3 Stadi ium I/ /II 192 should be noted that tumours with a diameter > 4 cm and N0 are classified in the current TNM classification in stage IIA. In elderly patients, patients with Z.N. Pneumonectomy and patients in reduced general condition, the tolerability was lower and the dose of administered chemotherapy decreased, so that these factors should be taken into account as well as a post-operative time interval of up to 60 days. Adjuvant chemotherapy should start within 60 days of resection after completion of wound healing. It can also be started up to 4 months after surgery if the recovery process is delayed. The reference for the 60-day window derives from the inclusion criteria of the large randomised adjuvanz studies [680], [666]. In an analysis of 12473 patients with NSCLC from the National Cancer Database, the adjuvants of chemotherapy was not associated with the administration of adjuvivant. Cancer Database of the USA showed that a later onset of adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with increased mortality and patients also benefited from subsequent administration of adjunct chemotherapy [689]. Background 8.28 (adjuvante targeted therapy) In May 2021, the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor was approved by the EMA as an adjuvant treatment option with osimertinib: The Phase III study ADAURA [669] investigated the adjuvivant use of osimergib versus placebo in 682 NSCLC patients at stage Ib-IIIA and detected EGFR mutation (Exon 19 Deletion, Exon 21 L858R) over 3 years after optional adjuvenant chemotherapy. In the first data evaluation after a median follow-up period of 22.1 months for osomertinib-treated patients, the primary study goal was achieved significantly in the improvement of disease-free survival in stage II-III A (hazardatio 0.17; IB < 0,16% of the rate of increase in stage 0,13 %; After two years, 89% of patients in the osimertinib-treated study were alive and disease-free compared to 53% with placebo. Consistent DFS results were observed in all subgroups, including patients treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy, and patients who received only one operation, as well as in Asian and non-Asian patients. Also, the 5-year overall survival was significantly improved (hazard ratio 0.49; 85% versus 73%) in the patient group in stage II-IIIA. In the overall population (stage IB-III A), the survival benefit was similar (hazard ratio 0.49) [670]. The safety and tolerability of osimergib in this study was consistent with previous studies in the metastatic setting. Undesirable events of grade 3 or higher of all causes occurred according to the researcher's assessment in 10% of patients within the osimerribtin group compared to 3% in the placebo group. Based on the authorisation, the molecular testing for EGFR mutations (Exon 19th day of absence) were also presented in the early AMO. In addition, the ESMO Congress 2023 presented interim data from the ALINA adjuvant therapy study in ALK positive patients for the first time. Data have not yet been published (as of December 1, 2023). 257 patients with NSCLC in IB-IIIA and ALK translocation were randomized to either adjuvant chemotherapy or 2-year alectinib therapy after complete resection. The primary endpoint (illness-free survival) was achieved in a median follow-up of 27.8 months for the total population 3 Stadi ium I/I II 193 (Stadium IB IIIA, hazard ratio 0.24; 3-year DFS 88.7% versus 54.0%). The improvement of the DFS was observed in all stages (Station IB: hazARD ratio 0.21; Stadium II: 0.24 ; Stadium IIIA: 0.25), with only 20 patients included in the stage IB. The improvement of the DFS was observed in all stages (stage IB: hazard ratio 0.21; stage II: 0.24; stage IIIA: 0.25), with only 20 patients included in stage IB. Also, the CNS specific disease-free survival was significantly better (hazard ratio 0.22) Background 8.29 and 8.30(adjuvant checkpoint inhibitor therapy) The Impower 010 study was a large randomised phase III study that tested in patients with fully-resected non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in stages IB, II and IIIA (resectable) the administration of the PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors randomized to placebo in patients after completion of adjuvanted platinum-based chemotherapy [671]. The study clearly showed a benefit for the adjuvant administration of atezolizumab versus placebo in subjects with PD- L1-IHC should be greater or equal to 50% (TPS). In addition, for the possibility of administration of Atezolizumab adjuvant, patients with EGF-R mutation or ALK translocation in tumour tissue must be excluded. If these conditions are met and there are no contraindications for immunotherapy with PD-L1 antibodies in patients, adjuvant administration of up to 16 times acetolizumab 1200 mg as iv infusion is followed every three weeks. Disease-free survival in the group of patients in stage II and IIIA and PD- L1 expression greater than or equal to 50% showed an HR of 0.43 (95% CI 0.27-0.68). Results of the disease-free injury were available at the approval date of atezolizuumab from this study. Overall survival was not significantly improved after a median follow-up of 45,3 months in the overall population (hazard ratio 0.995). In the cohort of PD-l1 expression ≥ 50%, however, by atezolizumab therapy, the overall survival was significantly improved in all stages of this stage III. Atezolizumab was also approved for adjuvant therapy for one year in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 50% after adjuvant chemotherapy [672]. Phase III data were also published for adjunct therapy with pembrolizumab. In the KEYNOTE-091 study, 1177 patients with fully-resected NSCLC in stage IB (Tumore ≥4 cm), II or IIIA (7th TNM classification) were treated with either placebo or 1 year of pembralizumab therapy. Prior adjuvart chemotherapy was not mandatory and was not performed in 14% of patients. There were two primary endpoints: disease-free survival (DFS) of the total population and patients with a PD- L1 tumour proportion score (TPS) at least 50%. Following a median follow-up of 35.6 months, the overall population was managed by a segificantly improved by the pembrodizumab dose (hazardatio 0.76; median). The survival advantage was very heterogeneous in the individual PD-L1 expression groups and different from studies of pembrolizumab in stage IV: in the cohort with PD- L1 expression ≥ 50%, the improvement of the DFS was not significant (hazard ratio 0.82; 95% confidence interval 0.57–1.18); in a PD-l1 expression of 1-49%, the effect was greatest (hazzad ratio 0.67; 0.48–0.92), and in an PD- l1 expression < 1%, the hazard ratio 8.3 Stadi Empfeh A Level of",

In patients without prior adjuvant chemotherapy, pembrolizumab did not improve DFS (hazard ratio 1.25; 95% confidence interval 0.76-2.05) in contrast to patients with adjuvant chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.73; 95% confidence interval 0.60–0.89). Data on overall survival have not yet been published. Pembrolizab was approved by the EMA for adjuvart therapy after complete resection and platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1 status [673]. Recommendations for future treatment development For future therapy development, the effectiveness of adjuvalent chemotherapy should be evaluated prospectively in potential risk groups (older patients, patients in reduced general condition, patients with post-pneumonectomy condition) taking into account comorbidity and cardiopulonic functionality, as well as the efficacy of new, targeted treatment approaches. Patients with condition after pneumonectomy) were prospectively evaluated taking into account comorbidity and cardiopulmonary functionality as well as the effectiveness of new, targeted therapeutic approaches. Postoperative radiotherapy Evidence-based recommendation tested 2024 grade patients with NSCLC in stage I and II should not be offered adjuvant radiotherapy after R0-resection. nce [690], [680],[691], (692],.[693], [...]694], ...695, [696] Strong consensus background 8.31 Postoperative radiation therapy is one of the oldest complementary therapies after resection of the NSClc. In a cochrane analysis, the effectiveness and toxicity of adjuvant radiotherapy was investigated in a randomised and non-randomised study of 2232 patients from 10 randomized studies or from published studies [689]. The significance of simultaneous postoperative chemotherapy therapy was evaluated in a study of 80 portion of the radiotherapy, and in a routine study of 69 years. In 1998 the majority of the available evidence was collected, and in the main part of the evidence available, patients recruited between 1965 and 1995 with the major part of patients in the 70s and 80s and used an outdated radiotherapy technique. In the adjuvant situation radiation doses of 30-60 Gy in 10-30 fractions were used. A survival advantage was not found in these studies for postoperative radiotherapy. Probably due to the therapy-associated morbidity the survival rates of the postoperative radiation therapy in the overall analysis of patients at stage I – III tended to be used in 10 - 30 fractions in the ajuvanvant position were used radiation doses from 30-60 g in 30-60 G in the 10-30 factions. In these studies, a survival advantage for post operative radiotherapy was not seen for post-operative radiology in these trials. In a subgroup analysis this effect was most pronounced in stage I (HR 1.42 (1.1.6-1.75) and stage II (HR 1.26 (1.04-1.52) in the last analysis of 2006 (HR 1.1 (1.00-1.22, 3 Stadiium I/I II (H 1.04-11.52)), but not in stage III (HR III (H 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.97 (HR 0.997 (0.5)) in stage 0.9 (0.5 0.9 ( 0.597 ( 0.57))))).

In stage III and in the detection of N2-lymph node metastases survival was not negatively affected (stage III: HR 0.97, N2: HR: 0.96) (evident level 1a). In the initial PORT metaanalysis it was found that the local relapse risk can be reduced by postoperative radiotherapy. While no significant prolongation of survival time or progression-free surviving time could be demonstrated by simultaneous chemoradiotherapy compared to a single radiation therapy in the collective, there was evidence that patients in phase III may benefit from this multimodal therapy concept [692]. This also follows from a subgroup analysis of the IALT study [680]. An evaluation of the Eastern Cooperative Group Study E3590 and the Italian study of Trodella et al. showed that post-operative radiography did not lead to a limited incidence of radiation. E3590 and the Italian study of Trodella et al. showed that postoperative radiotherapy with modern technology and narrowly limited target volumes does not lead to an increased risk of late, non-tumour-related deaths.

Depending on the infilted structures 4 Panc coast-T tumor 198 can be arm pain, arm paresis, horner syndrome (23% of patients) or arm vein thrombosis the clinical guide. Pancoast tumors are a prognostically independent clinical entity, but they still exhibit a large clinical heterogeneity. The decisive factors for this are therefore the different tumour stadia. A particular benefit of a trimodal approach is also concentrated on the tumor stadia T3-4 N0-1, since this treatment does not apply to the overall stages of the disease. Due to the rareness of this disease, there are no prospective randomized clinical investigations. Against this background, the monocentric data from large interdisciplinary working groups or the first multicentric phase II investigations from North America (Southwest Oncology Group Trial 9416) [697] is of decisive therapeutic relevance. The update search for the period 2010 to 2019 resulted in a total of 179 hits. Inclusion criteria were systematic survey work and comparative studies or prospective series. No new prospective studies on the topic were identified after sighting interesting results. Previous studies are summarized in the identified review work, however, which do not meet the criteria of a systematic review methodically [698] or only consider a small subgroup of the collective (pancoast tumor with vertebral body infiltration; [700]). The findings from the update research confirm the importance of the trimodal treatment concept based on the data of the SWOG study 9416 (Integroup 0160). Despite the unfavorable disease location in the sulcus superiorption of the breast tissue, the absence of the complete resection of the tumor. Preoperative radiotherapy can further improve local control by optimising complete reectability. Simultaneous radiochemotherapy (45 Gy with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 29, 36 and etoposide 50 mg /m2 day 1-5 and 29-33) as induction treatment has resulted in a significant improvement in local control rate and long-term survival according to data from the multicentre North American SWOG Phase II study 9416 (Intergroup Trial 0160) [697]. R0 resection rate was 94%, in 32 patients operated by 88 (36%), complete pathological remission was observed. Early postoperatively, 2.3% of patients died. 56% of the patients operated received two further cycles of cisplan / etoposide. The 5-year survival after complete resection was 54%, achieving complete pathologic resection, but not the T-stage (T3 vs. 4) were reported as follow-up of the resection in the period of treatment. in the case of a variance of inclusion criteria and treatment concepts, the concept of the Intergroup Trial was confirmed, 5-year survival rates in the range of 36% to 59% were reported (overview in [698]). Histopathological response (pathological CR) after pretreatment by radiochemotherapy is typically more favourable than imaging in the CT in this entity. In the SWOG intergroup study, only 53% of the 32 patients with complete pathological remission had previously shown measurable partial remission. In current histopathologic series 4 Panco oast-T Tumor 199, both the presence of complete pathologic remission (vs. no pCR; 5-year lifetime 70% vs. 20%) and the detection of <10% vital tumour cells (v s. >10% vital tumor cells; 5 year survival 65% vs. 18%) are confirmed as a prognosis factor [701]. The best established total dose is 45 Gy (SWOG/intergroup study) On the other hand, dose-density radiotherapy regimens with hyperfractionally accelerated therapy (2 x daily 1.5 Gy to 45 Gy with simultaneous cisplatin / etoposide, after three cycles cispabine plus etoposide or paclitaxel) have been reported, with 30-day mortality of 6.9%, the 5-year overall survival of 46%. [702] In the German ESPATUE trimodal therapy study, however, no specific data for the anatomical localisation of pancoastal tumors were reported, a similar intensive approach to administration was reported in the operating arm (three cycles cisplatin / paclitaxel, radiotherapy 45 Gy at 2 x 1.5 Gy per day with simultan cipsplatin/ vinorelative) of the 4th anniversary of chemotherapy was reported. Mitomycin-containing protocols are not preferentially used with routine toxicity data [704]. From data on newer chemotherapy combinations (e.g. cisplatin and taxol induction/cisplatin, and vinorelbin simultan) an optimal treatment regimen cannot be defined. Preferential, however, Cisplatin should be the combination partner of radiation therapy. According to data from the Southwest Oncology Group Trial 9416, simultane radiochemotherapy preoperatively represents the gold standard in the multimodal treatment of pancoast tumors [697]. Concepts with hyperfractional radiation (2 x 1.5 Gy to 45 Gy) achieved at least comparable pCR rates (45% in the Marra series, 2007 [702]). In a follow-up study to the SHOG 9416 intergroup 0160 study of Phase II, consolidating docetaxel treatment following the trimodal approach was evaluated [705]. Here, no improvement in overall survival was observed in post-stage studies. PDL1 positive non-operable patients in stage III (Chapter 8.5) have not been studied as standard in patients with pancoast tumours. Patients with inoperable pancoastic tumours should be treated as consolidating therapy in accordance with other non-operational stage III patients with PDL1, with Durvalumab. The prospective study of the Southwest Oncology Group [697] consisted of a perioperative morbidity of 52.9% following neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy and subsequent tumour resection. It was mainly atelectase (15%), pneumonia (14%), atrial arrhythmias (11%) and embyemema (6%). This increased 8.4 Panc abbildu coast-Tung 1 tumour 200 morbidness is attributed to aggressive pre-treatment and early postoperative chemotherapy [696]. The incidence of non-responsive lethality was similar to that of the renal function. The role of immunotherapy in neodjuvant therapy in operable or potentially operable pancoast tumors was considered in the framework of the 2023 guidance update. Whereas in NSCLC in operatable stage IIIA – outside the pancoAST tumor – currently immunochemotherapy can be used within neoadjuvante concepts (see chapter 8.5.3), the data on this situation in pancoest tumor is still limited. On the one hand, the integration of immunotherapies into a trimodal concept with radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery is investigated in studies [706], but there are no results available here. However, for important prospective studies on trimodal therapy in pancost tumors, rates of pathological complete remission of 28% and 29% respectively were reported [697], [705]. In a recent complete immunodeficiency review of all immunodecipients, respectively, was included in the 8. The view of international guidelines on the specific approach to pancoast tumors is heterogeneous. While the US NCCN guideline also recommends trimodal therapy in 2023 – followed by target therapy or immunotherapy – as standard [NCCN 2023], the UK NICE guideline has advised since 2011 to treat pancoastic tumours such as other NSCLC depending on reectability, tumor stage and patient condition [NICE 2019]. 13: Flowchart for the treatment of pancoAST tumors",

In patients, a radical mediastental lymph node dissection was performed. He distinguished the microscopic infestation of a single lymph node level (mN2L1), the microscopy of several lymph node stations (m N2L2+), the preoperatively detected infestations of a one single lymph nodal station (cN2 L1) and the pre-operatively known incidence of multiple lymph node sites (c N2 L2+).

In the TNM system, a subdivision of N2 is recommended for prospective data collection [709]. For everyday clinical use, the American College of Chest Physicians has proposed the following classification in its guidelines according to Robinson's and colleagues [341], [340] IIIA1 (mediastinal lymph node metastases found in postoperative histological treatment in one or more lymph node levels), IIIA2 (intraoperative detection of a lymph nodelevel), IIIAs3 (prefective, pre-tinoscope, PET or refective). For mediastinoscopy, fine needle biopsy or PET, potentially surgically resectable) and IIIA4 (\"bulky\" or fixed lymph nodes, surgically non-resectible).

The American College of Chest Physicians has also based on this classification worked on the literature on stage III therapy and prepared its recommendations. As the classification is clinically well applicable and is suitable for clinical therapy strategies, this classification is recommended in addition to the TNM classification according to version 8. Consensual recommendation 2024 The extent of a necessary additional diagnosis, the stage assignment and optimal treatment selection of the patient's onset of therapy should be determined by the frequency group.

Strong consensus Various definitive multimodal therapy regimes are available in the locally advanced stage of the NSCLS. Which is used is essentially determined by the exact tumor expansion. In addition to the exclusion of extrathoracular distance metastasis, the extension of the tumor disease in the mediastinum is of crucial importance for the prognosis and the further interdisciplinary therapeutic approach [710], [708],[712], a preoperative PET-CT examination is found for a mediastination of lymph nodes and is found as an exact assay.",

After induction chemotherapy, a PET-CT is even better suited for the assessment of N2 lymph nodes than a re-mediastinoscopy [714]. Overall, there is a rich literature and discussion on the advantages of PET CT for spread diagnosis [711], [226],[715],.[716],] [717]. A participation of mediastinal lymph node suspected in PET- CT must be finely woven, since the positive predictive value is low and insufficient [718]-Trote negative PET-CT is recommended for fine tissue clarification if there are suspicious N1 lymph node in the CT or the primary tumor in diameter greater than 3 cm and has high FDG activity, since occult mediastental lymph node metastases are frequently present in these situations [719,[20] There is a fine tissue method of use. The primary endpoint will be the endobronchial ultrasound. The endobronic ultrasound has a sensitivity between 83% and 94% [715]. In the randomised comparison between EBUS TBNA and mediastinoscopy, there were no relevant differences in sensitivity and negative predictive value [722]. As the complications and stress for the patient with EBUS-TBNA are lower than with mediastinoscopics, this is recommended as a first step. Whether or not a mediastinalysis is still connected after negative EBUS tbNA, depends inter alia on the local quality of EBUS diagnostics [723], [724],[725], 20) and the therapeutic consequences to be drawn. In thoraxoncological centers, however, a corresponding quality of the EBUS diagnosis should be documented in Germany. If a therapeutic consequence for the conduct of an operation can be found and the clear suspicion of a mediastinal lymph node case is evident, a negative EBUS assay should be carried out in the case of a positive endpoint. nce [726], [727],[728],.[729] Strong Consensus In stage IV, immunocheckpoint inhibitor therapy has significantly expanded treatment options. In earlier stages, there are data that the pretherapeutic PD-L1 expression is prognostically relevant [730]. Radiotherapy can lead to a change in tumour immunity [731], (732], 5 Stadi ium III I (T1-3N2 / T1-3N3 / T4N0-3) 205 Therefore, it was possible to test immune checkpoint inhibitors in addition to chemotherapy [732 ], [734], and [735] [736]. There are currently a number of studies that will give further answers. However, data from a phase III study with Durvalumab, a PD- L1 antibody after chemoray therapy, have already been published in the PACIFIC study with stable arm therapy, and in the course of a period of therapy with at least one stage of therapy. The data on the staging and exact TNM stage were missing. A significant PFS advantage with median 16.8 months (95% CI 13.0–18.1) versus 5.6 months (95%) CI 4.6–7.8) with stratified HR of 0.52 (95%CI 0.42–0.65; p<0.001) was observed. Overall survival was also significantly prolonged with strated HR of 0.68 (p=0.0025). Adverse reactions were somewhat increased. EORTC QLQ.C30 and QLq-LC13 questionnaires did not find any significant impairment due to the addition of durvalumab [729]. Relapse therapy data were lacking. 15.4% of patients in the Durvalumab arm and 9.8% of patients within the observation arm ended the study due to adverse reactions. A subgroup analysis required by the EMA showed no survival benefit for patients who did not have PD-L1 expression [727]. Accordingly, the IEMA II was restricted to the segment of the disease. Induction therapy by the addition of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors [737], [738],[739],.[740], (741], and [742]. Randomized phase III studies in both neoadjuvant and adjuvanted approaches are active. A study with atezolizumab after adjuvant chemotherapy showed an advantage in disease-free survival in recessed stage II – IIIA compared to best supportive care. This effect was stronger in the presence of PD- L1 expression [671]. Based on these data, in the inoperable stage III, chemoradiotherapy is usually followed by Durvalumab as a standard. In the operable stage, the inhibition of PD -1 or PD-l1 is likely to be established in the absence of a stable stage. The question of the best multimodal therapeutic approach is usually to be clarified in the thorax oncological tumor board.",

However, for patients in stage IB to IIIA, there were already initial data from randomized studies, which only represented subgroup analyses of these studies [746], but only one Chinese study had primary EGF Rfit mutation as an advivalase. Therefore, an adjuvant therapy with EGF-R TKI has not yet established itself. Currently, first data from the ADAURA study have been presented and published, which tested the adjuvant administration of the EGF R TKI osimertinib against placebo [669] in patients with classical EGF -R mutation (del 19, L858R) in stages IB, IIA and IIIA. Not all patients had received chemotherapy prior to this. The data show a significant benefit in the disease-free survival for the arm that received the molecular-targeted therapy [751].

Recommendation tested 2024 grade Adjuvant chemotherapy at NSCLC in stage IIIA1 and IIIA2 should be considered as a cisplatin-containing combination over 4 cycles if there is no contraindication. nce [703], [781],[782], (788],.[789], {790], (‘791', [792', ‘793', (‘795'), [796], ‘797', '798',[799], '800', Strong Consensus Cisplatin is and remains the most important cytostatic substance, which has an outstanding significance in man's cure of testicular tumours and, without the use of which, the possible curation in 98% of patients would never have been possible [788], \"789\", [791]. Exactly this high effectiveness of this substance is not yet established in the case of the described tumor. For this very high efficacy of this substance in the tumour described above, it is still unclear [790], [791]. Nevertheless, there were and are indications of the high effectiveness of cisplatin compared to its derivative, the carboplatin, in the metastatic disease. • Cisplatin-containing combinations versus carbolatin-based combinations of significantly higher remission results (metaanalysis Ardizzoni et al - based on individual patient data) [803] • In newer compound combinations of platinum + new substance, in this meta-analysis, a significant survival advantage can also be seen in the metastased situation by the cispabine-based combination [802]. • cispplatin also acts on G0 cells (outside the cycle, not proliferating) in tumour cells (in the meta-analysed situation). For overall survival benefit, a cumulative dose of cisplatin of 300 mg/m2 (subgroup analysis) [784] was particularly necessary. Based on these data, the continued adjuvant chemotherapy recommendation is based on cispabine combinations. Therefore, the current recommendation can only include cispplatin-based combinations for use in adjuvant chemotherapy. The only study that tested carboplatin/ paclitaxel primarily in this situation (CALGB study) has been promptly negative in terms of survival endpoint and only a subgroup analysis of patients with tumours above 4 cm showed a certain positive effect of chemotherapy [782]. Nevertheless, in all randomized studies with primary cisplaton use unisono, the option was to switch to carboplatin intolerant therapy [677], with today's standards of antiemesis and hyperhydration as support ions with cisptalin and the simple possibility of cisplatin clipation to the carboblatin combination [66], however, the dose of Cisplatin was significantly increased to 50 mg for compliance. The cisplatin dose split to two to three divided doses (33-50 mg/m2) should, however, have significantly increased compliance with cisplan therapy [681], [666]. Today we would rather leave the higher cisptan dosages on one day (80-100 mg/ m2) and then prefer day 1 and day 8 applications (50 mg/(m2 d 1+8) or three-day regimens (33 mg/M2 d1,d2,d3) [681), [666],[793],.[794], [10], [768], (703] [802], , [796). For other solid tumours, such cisppantin administration methods have been fully accepted and accepted since the 1980s [804]; [801] [797], and [798] in the case of non-small cell lung carcinoma, there is no objection to the use of cispantin as appropriate. Individual studies in the adjudication and administration of this combination data are also very good for the benefit of this study. Typical regimens for postoperative chemotherapy as adjuvant chemotherapy are the combinations of cisplatin and vinorelbin and the (old) combination of cisplatin and etoposide. Cisplatin, and pemetrexed, unfortunately, have not been approved for this indication [681], [799],[800]. To date, only a randomized phase II study has been published for this combination, from whose data, of course, no valid survival results can be derived. The additional introduction of an antiangiogenic substance (bevacizumab) has been tested in a large randomised phase III study [688]. There was no benefit for the addition of bevacizumbab to a cispabine-based combination chemotherapy, so that the standard cispplatin + X (vinorellbine) has not changed since [784],.[681]. As the current situation at the German Lung Cancer Centers shows relatively clearly that the conduct of adjuvant chemotherapy after complete resection is mainly due to relevant comorbidities (cardial, vascular, pulmonary, endocrine, infection, delayed surgical wound healing, surgical and postoperative compensation) only occurs in approximately 35 to 65% of patients 8.5 Stadi EKium III I (T1-3N2 / T1-3N3 / T4N0-3), it nevertheless makes sense to consider in such patients the primary administration of a carboplatin combination [803]. However, one approach should be examined on a case-by-case basis and not the rule. Consensual recommendation tested 2024 In patients with NSCLC in stage IIIA1 and IIIA2 with clinically relevant combination, the appropriate combination should be performed on the basis of a prior outcome of an interbiological treatment. Strong consensus background Characteristic of the operated lung carcinoma compared to other operated solid tumours (e.g. breast cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer) is the significantly higher median age of the treatment collective and the number and clinical significance of the existing comorbidities of the patients [785], [805]; [806];[807];.[807*]. Since more than 85% of lung cancer patients still have a long history of smoking, the focus is on pulmonary underlying diseases (COPD, emphysema) and cardiac findings (KHK) [808]. If one considers the current data of the German lung cancer centers, it becomes clear that only a proportion of 35 to approximately 65% of patients after complete resection in the corresponding stages are actually receiving adjuvant chemotherapy [785), [805],[806 ], [800] factors that play a relevant role here, but on the one hand, the patient's ability to treat adjuvants, on the other hand, to assess the incidence of stroke. Sepsis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, heart attack, stroke) by the treating interdisciplinary team. In particular, there are general risks such as a severely restricted cardiopulmonary reserve that prohibits any complication-preventing adjunctive therapy and removes specific risks: • renal insufficiency and cisplatin/pemetrexed • diabetes mellitus and taxane/pemetraxed (if no higher-dose corticosteroids are possible) • embolia or thrombosis and vinorelbin • pneumonitus/ COPD and gemcitabine It is understood that a decision is to be made interdisciplinary. In the certified centers, oncologists, pneumologists, radiation therapists, thoracic surgeons and radiologists will agree on a common understanding [809]. Based on this vote, the patient will then be informed of the conduct of adjuvant chemotherapy or alternatively advised on the basis of a long-term Avid therapy.",

The patient should be transparently involved in these decisions. In case of incomplete resection, interdisciplinary radiotherapy should also be discussed in the tumor conference [807],[821] in a mono-institutional evaluation from China, 113 out of 1547 patients in stage IIIA-N2 had R+ resection; 76 patients were R1. Median survival was 52 months for patients with post-radiology 22 months of resection. In the registry study of the NCI (3395 patients with R1 resection between 2005 and 2011), 1207 patients received postoperative radiation between 50 and 74 Gy. Regardless of lymph node status, survival in the irradiated group was significantly better (5-year survival 32.4% versus 23.7%; HR 0.8 (CI 0.7 – 0.92) [ Wang EH]. In a series of cases from Warsaw(81 irradiate patients after R1resection) the in-field control was 85% with a 3 year survival of 36%. Isolated adjacent lymph node recurrences were increased when only the R1 region was irradized. Currently, typical approaches are the conduct of adjuvant chemotherapy over four cycles and then sequentially the administration of a single radiotherapy of 50-60 Gy over five to six weeks [825], [826]. If the local risk is outweighed, a reverse sequence or a simultaneous procedure can be discussed. Such decisions can only be performed individually with radiation risks. In this study, radiotherapy was used simultaneously for chemotherapy after surgery [619]. Intercurrent deaths were not increased in long-term follow-up [693]. The close agreement between surgeon and radiotherapist can significantly reduce the complication rate of postoperative radiotherapy compared to old data, mostly from the 1990s.

However, a survival advantage for unselected collectives is not assured. However PORT metaanalysis with inclusion of studies with today's view of inappropriate technique and dose of radiotherapy was especially confirmed in case of non-tumoriality. This is confirmed in more recent data showing that the risk of local relapse under postoperative radiotherapy can be reduced in N2 situations [832]. Following the success of adjuvant chemotherapy in the 2000s, the question of adiuvant radiation was raised again, as due to competing risks in improving systemic control the local risk could again become more prominent. In fact, the long-term analysis of the ANITA study, in which a center-related decision for or against a postoperative irradiation occurred in N2-infestation, showed an advantage for the irradiated patient group in stage IIIA(N2) [833]. However, this was an unplanned subgroup analysis and not a randomised comparison. A retrospective analysis on the ground of the National-Cancer Center database also showed advantages for additional postoperative Radiotherapy [834]. Also, the analysis of SEER's initiative - i.e. an \"outcome research\" approach with 7465 patients treated between 1988-2002 showed a significant benefit for postoperative frequency. The previous versions of the S3 guideline have taken these data into account. Currently, however, the final published data of the first randomized phase III (LUNG-ART / EORTC) [835] were randomised to follow-up treatment with radiotherapy (54 Gy in 5.5 weeks) versus BSC after adjuvant chemotherapy. Virtually all patients received postoperative chemotherapy, in almost 40% the N2 diagnosis was only performed postoperatively and in just under 50% only one lymph node station was affected in the mediastinal system. Currently subgroup analyses regarding the extent of the mediastinal infestation are not yet published. The data were presented at ESMO in autumn 2020 as a lecture [836] and 2022 [839]. Although the study revealed a highly significant advantage or loco-regional relapse clearance for the irradiated group (mediastinal recidive 25 vs. 46%), the rate of non-tumouric mortality was increased by 2T-3. 5 Stadi ium III (T1-3N2 / T1-3N3 / T4N0-3) 217 Important discussion points for this randomized phase III study have become clear after the oral presentation. Thus, the overall population of the study is actually divided into three parts: • Patients without preoperative evidence of N2 infestation, intraoperatively but then microscopic or macroscopic detection of N2-infestation and randomisation (IIIA1 and IIIA2 according to Robinson, almost 40% of patients) • Patients with primary presence of a minimal N2-infection in only one lymph node, which were then operated (R0) and subsequently randomised (III A3 after Robinson, approximately 25-30%) • patients with initial N2 infection (minimal or multiple, IIIA3 or IIIA4, approximately 20 to 30%) who were treated primarily with induction chemotherapy and then operated on, detection of the N2-instance and randomization in the study) These three patient groups have a distinctly different prognosis. Thus the frequency is not affected by the study problems. For these subgroups, the power is probably not sufficient regarding the question (TRT postop or not) of functional phase III. Disease-free survival was more favourable in the arm with radiation therapy, but overall survival was not improved compared to the comparator arm. The short interval for increased death due to second malignancies in the irradiation arm indicates possible imbalance and the problem of the too small patient population. A Chinese study (PORT-C) for postoperative radiotherapy was published in 2021 in patients with pIIIA-N2 [840], which also showed no benefit of postoperative radiation therapy with respect to overall survival. However, obligat postoperative irration for each N2 stage after R0 resection is critical due to the above data situation. Other risk factors such as multiple N2 infestation, capsule crossing and seizure of the highest dissociated lymph node remain relevant regional risk parameters and should influence the indication for post-operative radio therapy. 8.5 Stadi Empfeh A Level of 1a TV4 Tvid III Hlung3 (Evid 1T-3). Following Robinson's classification of NSCLC – Multimodal Treatment Concepts Evidence-based recommendation tested 2024 grade patients with stage IIIA3 and technical and functional operability should be treated multimodally. Current multimodal options are the definitive radiochemotherapy +/- Durvalumab and the surgery after neoadjuvant therapy. nce [841], [842],[780],.[843], (844), [845], ...846], [...]848, [695],...795, [804],, [827] [849],] [850], _851]; consensus background The results for primary surgery or sole radiotherapy in patients with primary detectable N2 elevation are unsatisfactory [841,] [842,] [866, [843,] [884,] [745]. For most patients with pre-therapeutic response, the incidence of this frequency is further increased. Consolidation with immunotherapy seems to improve this level further (see below). Moreover, the value of the operation has also been tested in a multimodal approach. However, the precise definition of a subgroup that benefits from such an intensified approach is not exactly consistent. The first randomized study ([695], n = 332) is to be mentioned here for historical reasons. Tested at proven stage IIIA(N2) (referred to mediastioscopy or transbronchial puncture of LK) was a procedure with induction chemotherapy and then the randomization of definitive surgery versus radiotherapy [695 ]. Patients were included before the era of PET-CT as inclusion examination. The inductionschemotherapy consisted of the possibility of using 18 different chemotherapy protocols, both cisplatin-based combinations, carboplatin-based combination and platinum-free combinations were used. Essentially, non-resectable tumours were included. Because of unfavorable downsizing and downsagging, the incidence of very high-dose medications in these studies was very high. 5 Stadi ium III I (T1-3N2 / T1-3N3 / T4N0-3) 219 The four largest controlled studies that have treated patients in (still operable) stage III with multimodal therapy including surgery are: 1.

      "text": "The German Lung Cancer Study Group Trial treated all patients initially with platinum-based induction chemotherapy (cisplatin and etoposid) and in a randomisation arm, the patients were then operated on and treated only with R1 or R2 resection congestion postoperatively with radiotherapy [861]. In the second randomization arm, patients were subsequently administered simultaneous chemotherapy (albeit carboplatin and vindesine as chemotherapy component) after initial induction chemo therapy and then, if feasible, operated on. However, the patient population of the study included patients with IIIA (N2) and also a large number of IIIB patients (at that time under 6th edition UICC T4 or N3). PET/PET-CT was not regularly used as an inclusion criterion in the study. However the patients received virtually all a mediatinoscopy. EBUS was not yet performed at this time. Patient recruitment was performed between October 1995 and March 2003 between Outcom Centers. The unfavorable long-term data could be explained by the patient selection in 2/3 of patients with stage IIIB and missing pre-selection by the PET/PET-CT. The most important result of the study was that non-preoperative radiotherapy after R1 or R2 resection could also be performed postoperatively with comparable good results. As a second important point, pathological remission could be identified as trending for patients' prognosis [850]. The North American intergroup study 0139 (n = 396), based on previous single-arm SWOG studies on induction chemotherapy prior to definitive surgery, then randomized this concept to a definitive radiochemotherapy saturation [848]. Induction chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin and eoposid as chemotherapy component and radiotherapy of 45 Gy. In one arm, the operation was then carried out after four weeks, in the second margin, then radiochemosis to 61 Gy in conventional fraction, or in the case of recurrence in 2004. The patient selection was carried out in IIIA(N2) with confirmation of lymph node infestation due to biopsy or mediastinoscopy. Contralateral N3 lymph node infection had to be ruled out. The results of this large randomized phase III study did not provide a uniform picture. As the primary endpoint, the study for the overall survival (four-year survival of about 30% in both arms) could not represent a statistical advantage for the operation in this multimodal concept, which is also due to postoperative complications in small study centers with little operational experience 5 Stadi ium III I (T1-3N2 / T1-3N3 / T4N0-3) 220 [848]. The progression-free survival showed an advantage for surgery and a much criticized post-hoc subgroup analysis as a matched pair analysis for patients with lobectomy could provide a survival advantage for operation as a signal. Nevertheless, it was ultimately a negative study stating that the operation after induction therapy in stage IIIA (N2) was not better to define the benefit of definitive chemotherapy 48 patients. The surgical and multimodal expertise of the multimodal team had to be lifted when such invasive treatment concepts were carried out. In Germany, the infrastructure was shaped by the lung centres. There have been large lung clinics for a long time, which strive for the intensive multimodal therapy of lung cancer patients and show the expertise also in aggressive treatment strategies [768], [852],[830], (827], ...795],.[853], {358], Against this background, the ESPATUE study (n = 246) was conducted as a phase III study [703] from January 2004 to January 2013 at a few centers in Germany and the Netherlands. Here, the induction chemotherapy was performed with three cycles of cisplatin and paclitaxel. Then, the simultaneous chemotherapy therapy with cispabine and vinorelbin and twice daily radiotherapy was combined into the last week of chemoradiotherapy, the rest of the therapy was performed as a follow-up treatment of PET. However, late randomisation should minimize drop outs prior to the start of the comparative therapy phases. The result on the survival endpoint shows overall comparable findings of the intergroup study with a 5-year survival of 34% (ITT) and well over 40% in both randomised arms. In the primary endpoints overall survival and progression-free survival there are no significant differences between the poor. A difference between trimodal and bimodal was that the operation resulted in higher peritherpeutic morbidity, while the definitive chemoray therapy induced rather long-term consequences (fibroses, pulmonary scars, infection foki etc.). A further analysis of the ESPATÜ study could identify the PET-CT and PET-C Response (SUV) as an important prognostic factor in patients [857]. A recent meta-analysis confirms the statements of trimodal approaches versus definitive chemotherapy therapy [858]. The studies previously presented had also included pre-induction chemotherapy therapy. In the SAKK study (n = 232), however, a more locally limited patient population was included [804]. Few patients had \"bulky-mediastinal infestation and there is no information on the number of mediastinal 5 Stadi ium III (T1-3N2 / T1-3N3 / T4N0-3) 221 lymph nodes or stations involved within the N2 situation. This study had regularly had PET-CT as inclusion examination. Overall, effective induction chemotherapy could achieve a very good long-term result in this more single-station N2-situation. In this group, preoperative radiotherapy could not provide an additional advantage [804), whereby these were sequentially performed after induction chemotherapy and the accelerated fractionation of total dose of 44 Gy in 22 fractions within 3 weeks with a comitant boost. In the radiotherapy arm, 17% of the patients received no radiation, 16% of the subjects in the induction arm, but 23 were non-commissioned chemotherapy. In the SAKK study alone with cisplatin and docetaxel 12% complete pathological emissions (pCR) and ESPATUE 33% pCR in the cispplatin and paclitaxel induction group as well as chemoradiotherapy group. The complex data situation requires that in patients with probably resectable findings in stage IIIA3, the decision should be made in an interdisciplinary tumor conference and that the risks and comorbidities of the patient individually are introduced into the discussion about the optimal procedure. 8.5 Stage III Recommendationg B Level of Evidence",

The combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel, which is widely used in North America, or combinations of car boplatin with pemetrexed for non-plate cell carcinomas, but in studies there are no clear remission and survival results [862], [866], and [864].

In the NADIM I study [867], the randomized phase III study CM 816 was performed only in primary resectable patients of the stages IB,II and IIIA [655]. A total of 358 patients were randomised to one arm with preoperative chemoimmun therapy (three cycles induction with platinum doublette plus nivolumab) versus three cycles of sole induction chemotherapy (platinum doublette) in both 5 Stadi ium III I (T1-3N2 / T1-3N3 / T4N0-3) 223 arms followed by thoracotomy with surgery if possible in the sense of R0 resection. As chemotherapy, cisplatin combinations/(Cis/Pem, Cis/Gem) and carboplatin combinations (carbo/ Pem, Carbo/Pacli) were allowed in the study. Patients with known EGF-R mutation or ALK translocation were excluded from the study. Patients had to have a good general condition of PS 0 or PS 1. In an initial interim analysis, a minimal follow-up of 21 months for the median event-free survival for nivolumab plus chemotherapy was found to be 31.6 months (95% CI 30.2 versus not yet achieved) and 20.8 months (95%) for chemotherapy alone (HR 0.63, 97.38% CI 0.43 to 0.91, P= 0.005) [655). Data on overall survival were not yet significantly positive at this time. The three-year data of the study have so far only been published as a congress abstract [Forde et al., J Thorac Oncol 2023 suppl], they also confirm the results found in the publication. A significant benefit for event- free survival and a significantly higher pathological complete emission rate is not yet observed. Also, the significantly mature overall survival data with regard to TMA is still more clearly confirmed in the case of BENP1. The available results are now also much better secured in terms of survival. In this respect, a \"Can\" recommendation is appropriate at the moment. Further development of the marketing authorisation application at the EMA should be observed. It is important that the positive results in this study are mainly based on the patients of stage IIIA. Due to the selection of the study only the operable, resectable IIIA patients is critical to note that there is no randomised comparison to the likewise possible standard therapy at this stage \"definitive chemotherapy\" with Durvalumab preservation (in PD-L1 > or = 1% TPS). As discussed in detail in Chapter III, the existing expertise on the operation after multimodal induction plays a decisive role here, of course, as the treatment procedure is defined at the center in the common tumor board. As already discussed in detail in Chapter III, the existing expertise on multimodal induction surgery plays a crucial role here, as the treatment procedure is defined in the joint tumor board at the centre. If one takes the review work of Chinese and American colleagues to evaluate induction therapy in operable stages [656], one can at least also note with regard to toxicity, which is a preoperative chemoimmune therapy possible at acceptable toxicity and thus seems to be feasible in principle. 8.5 Stadi Empfeh B Level of 2b ium III Hungsg f Eviden I (T1-3N2 / T1-3N3 / T4N0-3) 224 Evidence-based recommendation tested 2024 degrees After surgery and R0-resection of a NSCLC at stage IIIA3, the evaluation should take place in the thorax oncological tumor board and at increased locoregional recidiv risk mediatinal radiotherapy. The dose should be 50-54 Gy in 5-6 weeks. nce [804], [868], (869), [870],[871], {836], (‘833'), [872], ‘874', [875], '877', ‘877', '822', {709],} [878] and 'strong consensus In the neoadjuvant chemotherapy studies of stage IIIA patients, the rate of complete resection among the operated patients is 70-85% [880], `804' and '868' respectively. However, after the metaanalysis of randomized studies by Billiet, postoperative radiotherapy significantly reduces the incidence of locoregional relapse in patients at stage IIIA by about half [869]. This is also confirmed by recent randomised studies of postoperative chemotherapy versus chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with fully-resected NSCLC in stage III A [870], [871] and also by Le Pechoux et al in the LungArt study, where locolocal first-recidence in the surgical arm without postoperative radiation therapy were seen in 46% of patients and with radiation therapy in 25% of patients [836]. In the ANITA post-operative chemotherapy study, post-operational radiotherapy was approximately half as high in Stage IIIA, after a fundamental decision by each participating institution prior to the start of the study, and 60% of patients at phase IIIA/pN2 received post- operative radiotherapy. Overall, after post-surgical radiotherapy, the rate of lokoregional recitive was approximately as high as well as without post-Surgical radiation therapy [8], all of the metatherapy was not fully-used in the stage. However, this metaanalysis included very old studies with outdated radiotherapy techniques. For the individual patient with high individual locoregional relapse risk, however, risk reduction due to postoperative radiotherapy may be of considerable importance. The target volume is based on postoperatively identified high risk regions. Billiet et al 2016 showed relapse localisations in 150 patients in stage IIIA/N2 after induction chemotherapy and surgery, with 86 patients receiving postoperative radiation therapy [873]. Relapse localizations corresponded to the known lobe specific lymph node infestations, with relapses in level 7 representing more than 10% of all relapse in all primary tumour lobe located. In left-side sub-lob tumours, 19% of all recurrent contralateral relapsed in level 5 stadiium III I (T1-3N2 / T1-3N3 / T4N0-3) were dependent on the relapse rate, while in the target volume selection, the incidence rate was considered in 7 of patients with postoperative relapse. The risk regions for regional relapses were located in the pulmonary lobe-specific lymph drainage area, dependent on the primary tumor [873]. Overall, postoperative radiotherapy should be closely adapted to the high-risk region in order to minimise toxicity. This includes the use of intensity modulated radiotherapy to closely adapt the high dose range to the target volume and thus minimise the risk of pneumonitis or cardiac load [874]. While the analyses of the data from the ‘Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results' (SEER) Registers or the ‘International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer' (IASLC) found no evidence of obesity in cardiopulmonary causes after postoperative radiation therapy [875], [876], there were indications of this from the Adjuvant Navelbine International Trialist Association Study and the LungArt Study regarding the dosing of postoperative Radiotherapy in conventional fractions [87]. NSCLC Meta-analysis Collaborative Group 2010), whereby 50 Gy were used in the studies with simultaneous postoperative radiotherapy [836], [870],[871]. However, after R1/R2 resection and sole postoperative radiation therapy, a small-volume increase in dose up to a total dose of 54-60 Gy is acceptable [881] . Postoperative risk factors are an R1-R2 response or an unsafe R(un) resection status [877],.[822]. In this case, a lymph node with extra-capsular extension leads to R1 status. The following criteria lead to an R(Un) status: less than 3 analyzed N1 or N2 lymph nodes; the highest remote mediastinal lymph node is positive; a carcinoma in situ at the bronchus removal margin; fewer lymph node stations were dissected than in a flap-specific lymph node infection. The highest remote mediastinal lymph nodes are positive; a carcinoma in situ at the bronchus removal margin; fewer lymph node stations were dissected than in a lobe-specific lymph node dissection. Also, the number of infected lymph node or the ratio of positive to remote lymph node is an important prognosis factor for survival [709], [878],[879]. 8.5 Stadi EK ium III I (T1-3N2 / T1-3N3 / T4N0-3) 226 Stage IIIA in NSCLC without N2 (T4NO and T4n1) – Multimodal therapy concepts Consensus-based statement tested 2024 In the subgroups NSClc T4 N0 and T 4N1 (each stage IIIA) the primary operation or the integration of the operation into the overall treatment concept in terms of technical and functional operability is possible after interdisciplinary evaluation in the thorax oncological tumor board. This should be weighed against the advantages of a neoadjuvant approach (see Recommendations 8.52) and 8.53. This should be weighed against the advantages of a neoadjuvant procedure (see Recommendations 8.52 and 8.53). Strong consensus In the subgroups T4N0 and T4 N1 (each stage IIIA) the primary operation or the integration of the operation into the overall treatment concept in the case of medical and functional operability is possible in the following cases: carina infestation, resectable tracheal infestations, resectable infestions of the diaphragm, pulmonary artery, atrium, vena cava superior, mediastinal, vertebral bodies, tumors >7cm or an ipsilobaric metastasis in the non-tumour-bearing lung lobe. An interdiscplinal therapy determination (tumor conference) and mediastental staging including invasive procedures for the safe detection of mediastinal lymph node metastases are required. In case of infiltration of the mediastinum or a vertreous body, the titjuvantic therapy is not negatively influenced by the prognosis of the lung. If the T4 situation is defined by the infiltration of surrounding organ structures, then a differentiated consideration is necessary [882], [883]. Basically, a mediastinal lymph node metastasis affects the prognosis much more than the tumor infiltration in neighbouring structures. Although this is a small subset of lung carcinomas in stage III (<2% of all lung cancers operated [884], the group of these T4 tumours (T4 by infiltration of adjacent structures in N0 or N1) is still very heterogeneous. Both the effectiveness of the integration of the operation into a multimodal therapy concept as well as the question of a neoadjuvant therapy are influenced by the organs or tissues affected by the tumorinfiltrated. Randomized data are not expected to be related to the presence of T4 receptors. The results obtained in this selected patient group should be confirmed by MESK/VAMLA or VATS. Very good results can be achieved after R0-resections with infiltration of the left atrium [886], [887], in particular if there is no N2 situation. In a retrospective analysis of Tsukioka et al., the 5-JÜR after lung resections are found in the atrium section 46% for the overall group (n=12) and 67% for N0/N1– tumours (n = 7) versus the atoctomy of 5-JURI. Due to the rarity of this oncological situation, there are only retrospective case series with small patient numbers [883]. After endovascular implantation of an aortic stent, Marulli et. al (2017) described a lower complication rate for en-bloc resection of lung carcinoma with aortan infiltration. For T4 tumours with infiltration of pulmonary artery, a best-evidence-topic [882] showed a significantly better 5-year survival rate (52.8%) compared to T4 tumors with other structures. The use of the heart lung machine (HLM) did not lead to a worsening of the long-term results [889], [888],[890] (Evidence Grade 3a]. Langer et al. have retrospectively the results of resectional T4 cancers with HLM (n=20) and without HLM(n=355). In case of a 5 year survival rate of postoperative survival, neither of 40% nor of the 2 year survival resulted in long-time survival. In a 5-year survival rate of 40% and a 10-year survival ratio of 26%, there was no difference between the two groups for long-term survival or severe postoperative complications. A systematic review (20 article included – 5-JÜR 37%) [890] showed that the long-time results were significantly better when HLM (5-JÜr 54%; median 67 ± 19 months) than after emergency unplanned use of HLM ( 5-JüR 11%; median 19 ± 6 months; P = .006). The en-bloc resection of lung carcinomas with infiltration of vertebral bodies is technically demanding and associated with long operating times. However, the procedure offers a chance for good long-lasting results for selected patients, especially after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. Mody et al. reported a 5- year survival rate with infillation of lung resections with complete or partial vertral body resection, with 25 of the 32 patients receiving neojuvante therapy. Overall, the value of neoadjuvant therapy for T4 tumours with infiltration of surrounding tissues was not systematically investigated [883]. The interpretation of the data is further complicated as in most studies the proportion of patients with mediastinal lymph node metastases is between 20 and 50% [882]. In the retrospective analysis of carcinomas with infillation of the heart or large vessels [888], patients with a T4N2 situation (9 patients) received neoadjivant radiochemotherapy. 5-JÜR in this group was 22.2% versus 40% in the group without neoadjuvent treatment (no preoperatively secured N2 situation - 5 patients). If downstaging was achieved, 8.5 Stadi EKium III (T1-3N2 / T1-3N0-3) was found in the 5-JUR 50% (5 patients) compared to 0% after neoadjurant treatment in T4n2 situation without measurable response. In the prospective studies, however, the T4N0-1M0 tumors were always subgroups [703], [892]; [854],[796]. According to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy operable patients with cT4cN0-M0 tumours showed 5-year survival rates of >50% [854, [893] and [894] [895]. Most common T4 criteria in neoadyuvant treated patients were mediastinal infiltration, infestation of large heart attack and carina infestations [896],.[894 ], [893]. Especially for carcinomas with infiltrations of the mediastinal fat tissue or the vertebral body, neoad Juvant therapy is recommended. Consensus-based recommendation tested 2024 For primary molten tumours, risks of (radio) chemotherapy should be weighed against those of primary surgery. Strong consensus The presence of a tumor space requirement with molinations is already found prior to breast cancer. In three retrospective patient cohorts, the risk of fatal lung bleeding in the first year after treatment was between 30% and 37% when initial tumour melting was present compared to 2 to 5% in patients without this risk factor. 8.5 Stage III Recommendationg Level of Evidence",

[656] Strong Consensus The best 4-5 years of long-term data in this patient group are obtained with simultaneous radiochemotherapy followed by consolidation therapy with durvalumab [726]. In the treatment arm with durvalumab, the 4-year survival rate was 49.6% and the 5-year survival rates from the survival curve 42.2% [727]. The Pacific study did not require stage-classification methodology (PET-CT?, EBUS ? Mediastinoscopy?) In this study, the patients were randomised after completion of radiochemopia. This study included only patients who had low progression with radiation chemotherapy, as defined by RTOG data less than 5% of patients [897]. Under the above conditions, patients at clinical stage IIIA had the same prognosis as patients at stage IIIB. Durvalumab could significantly reduce the incidence of loco-regional recidive, brain metastases and extracebralen metastas, as measured by the frequency of radiotherapy, or radiotherapy. In another, more recent study on definitive radiochemotherapy, the RTOG-0617 study, 32% after simultaneous radiation chemotherapy to 60 Gy [897], [898]. In this study, 65% of patients had lymph node infestations of category N2 and 35% of categoryN3. Similar survival rates were shown by the Proclaim study on permanent radiocheme therapy with a majority of patients in stage IIIB [847]. A restriction of all previously randomised chemotherapy studies is 5 Stadi ium III I (T1-3N2 / T1-3N3 / T4N0-3) 230 that mediastinal diagnosis was not consistent. Thus, as a rule, the extent of mediastinal lymph node infection in patient characteristics is not histologically defined. It is only known as stage IIIA and stage III B, often after the sole CT or PET/CT findings. However, this is in nature of clinical staging and is enhanced with the increasing use of EBUS TBNA, so that the incidence of abnormality in the future is still better than the incidences of frequency and frequency in the frequency of frequency. In this study, no patients with N3 lymph nodes were enrolled and only 22% of the patients recruited showed an infestation of more than one lymph node station, with 20% two and 2% having three infested lymph node stations [848]. This study showed a reduction in the operating arm of 10% versus 22% after definitive radiochemotherapy. In a study conducted by the Swiss SAKK study group on trimodal therapy including surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy in stage IIIB, the 3-year survival rate was 30% [892]. However, 26% of patients had cT4 cN0 M0 tumours, after the older stage division was a stage III B. Overall, the frequency of radiochemotosis in all stages was 6B. The complete resection rate was 77%, the 5-year survival rate was 40% [796]. However, patients with T4 N0 M0 after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy and surgery had a significantly more favourable prognosis of over 60% after 5 years [893]. Friedel et al. closed 87 patients in stage IIIB, of which 15 with T 4 N0 m0 tumors, into a prospective study with neoadjunvant Radiochemo therapy and surgery [854]. Overall, 65% of patients were operated and 48% R0-resecerated. The 5-year survivability rate was 18.4%. Patients who had a complete mediastinal downsagging had a better survival forecast of 53% after 5 year. Pöttgen et al, 2015 showed that a cN3 status had an adverse effect on achieving a pathological complete remission was a favourable prognostic factor after neoadhuvant radiochemos therapy and that also the T-Stadium in cN 3 tumours had an important prognotive significance for the induction of radiombunciation after treatment. Radiochemotherapy followed by resection compared to induction chemotherapy and definitive radiochemotreatment 37% of patients had a stage IIIB with mediastinal lymph node [703]. Randomised only patients who appeared as R0-resectable after neoadjuvant radiocheme therapy were treated after neoadejuvante radiochemitherapy. Overall, 65% of the enrolled patients were randomised, indicating the importance of good downsagging in case of more extensive mediastial infestation prior to surgery. The 5 year survival rates after randomisation were significantly increased in the bimodal arm in 40% and in the trimodal arm at 44% after 5 years. Thus, they did not differ significantly (p=0.34). Following a metaanalysis of the randomized studies, the R0 response rate can be followed by neoadjurotherapy compared to the sole neoadjunitous chemotherapy (Odds-ratio: 0.46). The rates of postoperative complications were the same after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy and chemotherapy. Survival data of patients with mediastinal tumours > 5 cm were unfavourable after neoajuvante chemotherapy. In this study 7 out of 8 patients died within the follow-up period compared to 4 out of eight patients after neoadejuvanted radiochemostherapy. In the study, sequential radiotherapy was used after induction chemotherapy and only a rate of pathologically complete remissions of 16% were achieved in the patients who were resecrated. Following neoadjivant simultaneous radiochemomotherapy, twice as high pCR rates were achieved [703]. In addition, a mediastental downsagging to a pN0/N1 status in > 60% of patients can be achieved by neoadjunvante simultan radiochemometer therapy [768]. An important function can also be performed as salvage measurement after fully dosed simultaneous radiochemus therapy in tumor persistence. Cerfolio etmiposis was shown to be safe in the frequency group. Overall, the added benefit of an operation compared to definitive radiochemotherapy and durvalumab maintenance therapy in these advanced stages is not proven. The results of further (current) confirmatory studies are very important. Definitive radiochemosy remains the standard reference therapy, which is also carried out in most patients. Should an operational procedure be considered in individual cases, a very good patient selection and the avoidance of relevant toxicities are of significant importance. The R0-resection should also be evaluated in the mediastinum in accordance with the criteria of the IASLC histopathologically [822]. 8.5 Stadi EK EKium III I (T1-3N2 / T1-3N3 / T4N0-3) 232 Stadium IIIA4, IIIB and IIIC in the NSCLC – Multimodal therapy concepts in the case of clear inoperability consensus based recommendation 2024 patients with NSClcc at stage IIIA4 / IIIB or IIIC should be treated as a rule – if general condition and tumour expansion are allowed in the event of radiomulosis therapy and radiomula therapy. new 2024 In patients with NSCLC in stage IIIA4, IIIB and IIIC and lack of possibility of simultaneous or sequential radiochemotherapy, the sole radiotherapy can be evaluated. Strong Consensus The metaanalysis of Auperin et al. 2010 of 7 randomized studies available at this time forms the evidence basis for the statement that a simultaneous combination of radiotherapy and simultaneous platinum-containing chemotherapy is more effective than a sequential combination [903]. Five of the 6 studies used in this metaanalysis cisplatin in simultaneous radiocheme therapy, a study carboplatin. A significant survival advantage was found in the arms with simultaneous radiochemotherapy (HR 0.84: 95% CI: 0.74-0.95). This statement is confirmed in a more recent metaanalysis on the endpoint of survival rates after 2-5 years [904]. In addition to overall survival, local tumour control in the arm with simultaneous chemotherapy was also improved. Other organ toxicity was the same with simultaneous versus sequential chemotherapy. Since then, the large randomised studies of definitive radiochemotherapy with very good long-term results with simultaneous, platform-containing combination chemotherapy have been conducted [699], [898],[703],.[905], Inoperable patients with contraindication against both simultaneous and sequent radiochem therapy can nevertheless be considered for curatively intended radiotherapy alone. For example, the T4 situation may be called due to an ipsilateral second finding, here both lesions of ablative stereotactic radiation therapy (SBRT) may be achieved [907]. 8.5 Stadi Empfeh B Level of ium III hdg Fviden I (T1 to 10 fractions) tumour control rates of between 64 and 96% may also be achieved with large tumour lesions > 5cm with adjusted dose concepts (4 to 10 factions) [907], also for large tumor lesions > Tmiplied II. In both simultaneous and sequential radiochemotherapy, 2 cycles of fully dosed cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy (cycle interval 3-4 weeks) should be administered. Combination partners are usually vinorelbins or etoposid in simultaneous therapy. nce [908], [909], [9], [911],[913],.[915], (915), [925] and the standard of simultaneous radiation chemotherapy at NSCLC in stage III is used in the six randomized studies on which the metaanalysis of Auperin et al. 2010 and the standards of simultaneous radiocheme therapy at N SCLC in phase III are based. The study of Bi et al. was conducted with patients in performance status ECOG2 [911]. An increased efficacy of etoposide/ cisplatin compared to paclitaxel/ platinum derivative was also found in a direct meta-analysis [913]. In the international register study of Palma et al, 2013 with 819 patients, higher rates of therapy-associated pneumonitis were found after simultaneous radiochemotherapy with carboplatin/ taxol than cispabine/ etoposide [914]. This was confirmed in the randomised studies of Bi Et al. (2020) and Liang et al (2017). Larger randomized studies with Cisplatin/etoposid or cisplan/ vinorelbin simultan for radiation therapy were performed by Fournel et al 2005 and Senan et al 2016 and Zatloukal et al . 2004 and Eberhardt et al 2015. Compared with the vinca-alkaloids as a combination with ciplatin. Cisplatin/vinorelbin as palliative chemotherapy in stage IV is less haematotoxic than cisplatin / vindesin / mitomycin [916]. Following previous induction chemotherapy with cispplatin / taxol, the rate of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia was significantly lower with cisplatin/ navelbine simultane for radiation therapy at 3% than with ciSPlatin/ etoposide at 22% [795], [703]. In the PACIFIC study 208 patients received taxane, 114 patients etoposide and 125 navelbin as combination partners of cispabine or carboplatin simultan for radiation treatment [917]. The toxicity observed with Durvalumab consolidation therapy did not differ directly with respect to the various previous cytostatic combinations [917].",

Among the patients enrolled in the Pacific study, 27% of patients received induction chemotherapy. It was notable that Severe Adverse Events under Durvalumab consolidation in patients with induction chemotherapy were observed less frequently than in patients without induction (18% vs. 33%, [726]. However, effectiveness of induction therapy was found in randomised studies prior to surgery in patients treated with NSCLC at stage III. Here, 2-3 cycles were applied [659]. Overall, general condition and comorbidity and age of patients must be considered during individual therapy selection. Thus, older patients have shown more adverse reactions up to deaths during simultaneous radiochemosia [759]; in individual cases, low dose daily carboplatin or age of therapy are not suitable for the treatment of patients with full exposure to radiation. Appropriate regimens have shown their effectiveness in randomized studies compared to radiotherapy alone [760], [919]. Evidence-based recommendation tested 2024 grade Radiotherapy should be based on the involved field principle of a current pretherapeutic PET-CT and fine-woven staging. Heart and lung protection should be optimised according to the state of the art. nce [906],[920],.[921], [9], [874], (1923], (924), [924] and [925] Strong consensus A current PET- CT examination and a minimally invasive spread diagnosis of mediastinal lymph discharge, usually by means of endoscopic ultrasonic transbronchial needle-aspiration biopsies (EBUS-TBNA) and the bronchoscopy finding form the basis of radiation planning for patients with NSCLC in stage III. In approximately 5 to 10% of patients, the EBUS-binchial needle-spiration biopsy can be removed from the non-biologically-diagnosis of the metabolite. Also, the misdetection rate of PET/CT can be quite high, especially in lymph nodes located away from the primary tumor and outside the lobe-specific lymph outflow [921], [920]. Overall, an irradiation plan based on a PET/ CT is complemented by a minimally invasive mediastinal spread diagnosis according to the results of comparative investigations more precise than the radiation planning with elective lymph node radiation after a lung lobe specific spread probability.Loco-regional tumor control was not subordinated to a protocol analysis in the PET Plan study following PET-based radiation planning of a larger volume of radiation therapy involving elective Lymphononea and CT-positive lymph node.

The CHART study (without concomitant chemotherapy) suggested that an increase in the biologically effective dose beyond 60 Gy could lead to an improvement in long-term outcomes [928]. However, with the development of high-conformity radiation techniques, some significant dose escalations (up to 90 Gy, mostly in phase I/II studies) were investigated. The metaanalysis of Ramroth (3795 patients from 25 randomised comparisons of radiation dose) showed that dose escalation over 70 Gy in simultaneous chemotherapy resulted in worse survival. In the studies with radiotherapy alone, the increase in biologically active dose with better tumour control and a survival advantage was also significantly observed (RTOG 0617 randomised two dose levels (n = 544; 60 Gy/30 fractions versus 74 Gy /37 fractions) of an increased dose of radiospionitone (several gabrotone). There were increased protocol violations and a worse local tumor control (p=0.07), but also increased cardiac and oesophageal toxicity. The reported data are based on conventional fractionation with single daily doses of 1.8 -2 Gy. An increase in biological efficacy was also investigated by a change in fractionation, mostly with a reduction in the overall treatment time. The accelerated hyperfractional radiotherapy up to a total dose of 65 Gy -71 Gy in 5.5 radiation weeks was also examined by a variation in fractionations, usually with a decrease in the total treatment time up to 60-70 Gy and resulted in comparable results with the trimodality including surgery [703]. In the metaanalysis of Mauguenetal. (1637 patients in stage III NSCLC; 10 studies), the 5 year survival was slightly better (10.8 vs. 8.3 %), but without advantage for progression-free survival. The oesophagus toxicity was relevantly higher (> 19 versus 9 percent) and the logistically-integrated incidence of radiation was significantly improved. Due to planned or unforeseen interruptions of radiation treatment, radiation biologic is unfavourable due to the rapid repopulation of lung carcinoma [929] and has led to a deterioration of results [930].

      "text": "The addition of immunotherapy to definitive radiochemotherapy represents one of the significant therapeutic advances in stage III. The randomised STAR Trial (vaccination with Tecemotides after radiochemos therapy of any kind; n = 1239, 2:1 randomisation) had a strong signal in the group of patients with simultaneous radiochemometer therapy (p= 0.016; median survival 30.8 versus 20.6 months) in the PACIFIC Trial (713 patients 2:1 Randomization against placebo) and the PD-L1 inhibitor Durvalumab (3-weekly over 12 months after response to platinum-based simultaneous radiohemotherapy). The randomisation was performed after completion of radiochemothia therapy for non-progressive patients. Pretherapeutic PET Staging was not obligate and the survival rate was not determined for this period of time. In multivariate (post-hoc) analysis, only patients with PD-L1 expression < 1% had no benefit. Adverse reactions were slightly increased (G3/4 31% vs. 26% in the placebo arm, especially pneumonia and thyroid abnormalities). [699], [727]. Unlike immunotherapy, approaches with targeted substances (EGFR inhibitors, antiangiogenesis) have not shown any positive results (overview of Reck et al.) Many studies (Phase I/ II) with concomitant administration were discontinued prematurely due to partly serious complications. In a randomised phase III maintenance therapy with gefitinib (SWOG S0023) with 243 patients without progression after simultaneous radiochemotherapy (61 Gy simultan with 2 cycles of cisplatin/ etoposide) were followed by 3 cycles of docetaxel with gefitinib group significantly worse. Cause of increased tumour progression was seen as an addition to COG toxicity. Cetuximab was administered in parallel with carboplatin/paciltaxel during radiotherapy. This was followed by consolidation with further 2 cycles of carbolatin/paclitaxel. Cetiximab did not lead to an improvement in survival (HR 1.07 CI 0.84-1.35). Grade 3-5 adverse reactions were significantly increased. (86 versus 76%). Evidence-based recommendation tested 2024 degrees Following definitive radiochemotherapy at NSCLC stage III, no consistent chemotherapy should be performed. nce [935], [848],[847], [9], [937] [938] Strong Consensus While induction chemotherapy with carcoplatin-based protocols for simultaneous chemo/radiotherapy could not improve results, in E 5 Stadi K ium III (T1-3N2 / T1-3N0-3) was achieved as a full-dose regimen of 3 months. This concept was adopted in the randomized study INT 0139 (IIIA) as a standard for the radiochemotherapy arm [848]. Also in the PROCLAIM study on the significance of pemetrexed/ platinum for simultaneous radiochemos therapy, consolidation chemotherapy was part of the protocol [847]. However, a randomised phase III comparison of the Hoosier Oncology Group [936] of the above consolidation protocol against single simultaneous radiochemical therapy was prematurely discontinued after 203 patients, as no significant result improvement could be achieved according to an interim analysis. Median survival in both arms was 21.7 months, the 3-year survival was 27%. In the consolidation arm, morbidity was increased and the treatment-associated letality with 7% was noticeable. Also, Korean KCSG-Lu05-04 (consolidation with docetaxel) and the German GILT study (consolidation with cisPT/vinorelbin) did not show any adverse effect on the consolidation of radiation therapy. Unexplained is the importance of additional chemotherapy after weaker dosed radiochemotherapy (e.g. weekly administration of carboplatin/taxanes). Consensus-based recommendation tested 2024 In non-small cell lung cancer stage III, prophylactic whole brain irradiation should not be performed. Strong consensus Between 20 and 40 % of patients with NSCLC develop brain metastases [939]. Unlike the situation in small cell lung carcinoma, prophylactic whole brain radiation does not improve overall survival in non-little cell lungcarcinoma although a highly significant reduction was detectable for the occurrence of brain metastatics in all previously published 8 randomized studies. However, the majority of doses of 30 gy in 10-15 fractions were used. In the metaanalysis of Li etal. [940] among 1568 patients, the hazard ratio in favour of PCI was found in 0.29 (CI 0.2-0.4) but the overall survival was increased as a result of clinical studies (HR 1.08 (CI 0.91-1,21). 16 studies patients n=3553, both SLLC and NSCLC) are considered heterogeneous in terms of the instruments used and the quality of the data, but the incidence of neurocognitive disorders after PCI is clearly higher. However, influences on the global quality of life were not detectable in the current NVALT-11 study despite an increase in mild and moderate neurocoognitive restrictions in the PCI arm [942]. 8.5 Stadi Empfeh B Level of",

Shortened fractionation regimens should be used depending on the patient's condition and desire. nce [943], [944],[945], [9]6, [947],.[948], (1949], [10], [951] Strong consensus Approximately 20-35% of patients with locally advanced NSClc may not receive definitive multimodal therapy due to tumour size, general condition and comorbidities [942]. Thoracular radiation for symptom reduction or prevention of short-term threat complications is reportedly effective (diagnosis 4). As for effectiveness, there were no significant differences between the fractionations studied in the Cochrane Review of Stevens et al. [945] as in the metaanalysis of Fairchild et al [946]. Median survival was almost 9 months. However, patients in good general condition regarding 2 annual survival seem to benefit from higher total doses (> 35 Gy BED10). Also, the updated ASTRO guideline on palliative thoracic radiation therapy of 2018 [947], which, based on 3 randomized studies [948], [949] and [950], suggests a possible survival benefit from simultaneous radiochemotherapy in patients who are eligible for chemotherapy, recommends individualizing the duration and intensity of radiation. However the criteria for appropriate patient selection are not yet clearly defined. To what extent the targeted use of immune check point inhibitors indicates the disease dynamics and indication for designated local therapy is currently unclear as regards the frequency of the dose response, as well as the incidence rate of the incidence of a dose-related study.

For the detection of fusions fluorescence-in-situ hybridizations and immunohistochemical detection or sequencing methods should be used according to the recommendations of the German Society for Pathology5. A quality-proof, tissue-saving and comprehensive (therapy-relevant target) methodology should be applied. An external quality assurance in the context of ring trials should be demonstrated. 5 see [954] EK In case of insufficient tissue for a molecular diagnosis, and if a repeat biopsy can not be performed with an acceptable risk. Recommendations for molecular testing (see chapter 6.6.10 ) Background In the overall group of patients in stage IV and stage IIIB without indication for definitive local therapy (old stage III B, which cannot be added to curative radiotherapy due to the size or location of the tumour or the presence of pleural effusion), the median survival time is 8-18 months [955], [956],[957]. Compared to metastatic colon or breast cancer (median survival time 20-24 months), this period is significantly shorter and the age median (67 years) and the frequency of comorbidities (COPD, KHK, PAVK) is higher. In this time window, in addition to other manifestations frequently painful or fracturgical skeletal metastases as well as brain metastasis (mostly with initially discrete symptoms), rapid diagnosis and therapy initiation is required in order to maintain the quality of life. This requires access to a care context in which quick, competent and safe decision and therapy is made. A prerequisite for this is a rapid access to interdisciplinary decisions with adequate expertise (tumour conference). Basically, oncologically experienced pneumologists, thoracic surgeons, radiooncologists, internal oncologists and, if necessary, palliative physicians should be involved here. 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 245 In addition to the competent implementation of the symptomatic, specific therapy measures, adequate information of the patient and his/her relatives is necessary to provide safety in the course of treatment and at the same time to open up the possibility of an active and supervised examination of the limited perspective of life. Prerequisites for this are the information about the nature, character, prognosis and treatment possibilities of the disease for patients and relatives, as well as the continuous reflection on this during treatment. The challenges in the physical, mental, social and spiritual dimension are complex. Preference-sensitive care means that the measures necessary for the individual patient, the individual objectives and the appropriate response to the individual preferences during each of the treatment. Preferential care means that the measures necessary for the individual patient, individual goals and individual preferences during the course of the disease are adequately recorded and addressed at the above-mentioned levels. The basis is a realistic, supportive communication line (prognosis of the illness; potential benefits of disease-specific measures; potential significance of palliative medical measures with or without connection to alternative treatment concepts) [494], the so structured communication should start early – at least within two months after diagnosis of a metastatic disease with an expectation value for the median survival time under 12 months (see chapter 8.2). Through the structured contacts, positive effects (life quality; management of symptoms; mental stress on the patient and relatives) are achieved when these are conducted at least at monthly intervals over at least three follow-up contacts (see section 8.2). A special feature of metastatic lung cancer surgery, compared to other metastatic carcinoma, is that the available time window is often comparatively short. For the attending home or specialist, there should be the possibility of receiving on-the-spot therapy and providing a competent response to the patient. In view of the short lifetime, it is important to establish this care context binding and continuously from the time of diagnosis. Thus, an environment characterized by mutual knowledge and trust is established, which carries the patient up to the terminal life phase [666]. In the metastatic situation there are potentially curative situations, which are called OMD (oligometastasised disease) and should be clearly distinguished from the purely palliative approach in stage IV, These patients are to be guided like patients in the limited stages under curative concept (see chapter 8.6 Stadi Empfeh A Level of",

Patients who expressed PD-L1 to at least 50% of their tumour cells were excluded from EGFR activation mutation or ALK fusion. Crossover from the chemotherapy arm to pembrolizumab therapy was allowed in disease progression. The primary endpoint was median PFS in the central review. The median PFA with pembrilizumab was 10.3 months (95% CI 6.7 to not reached) and was significantly superior to the chemotherapy arms (6.0 months, CI 4.2-6.2). The hazard ratio for progression was 0.5 (95% AI 0.37- 0.68, p<0.001). Survival data after 6 months was 80.2% in the pembrlizumab group vs. 72.4% in the chemotherapy group (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.41-0.89, p=0.005). Surval data following a median observation period of 25.2 months showed a median survival time of 30.0 months in the Pembrolizab group versus 14. The response rate in the pembrolizumab group was 44.8% vs. 27.8% in the chemotherapy group. Treatment with pembrilizumab was less toxic both for all listed adverse reactions (adverse events grade 1-5; pembralizumab 73.4%, chemotherapy 90.0%) and for severe adverse events (adverse events grade 3.4.5; pembrolizumab 26.6% vs. chemotherapy 53.3%). New signals regarding the type of adverse reactions were not observed. Pembrolizab's superiority was seen in all subgroups (histology, age, ethnicity, etc.). A quality of life analysis recorded 299 of the 305 patients studied in the KEYNOTE-024 study. A deterioration in quality of living was reported less frequently among pembrlizumab and the time to deterioration in the quality of the life was reported for pembrollizumab longer than under chemotherapy. In the Pembralizab group, but not in the chemo group, improvement of quality of use was reported with pembrizumab. Following failure of the first-line therapy with pembrolizumab, patients are preferred to be offered a combination of cytostatic agents as second-line treatment, according to a ‘first-line combination therapy'. In a phase III study (Impower 110, [962]), 572 patients with untreated, advanced NSCLC were given monotherapy with atezolizumab (1200 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) or platinum-based chemotherapy (4 or 6 cycles) with cisplatin (75mg/m2) or carboplatin AUC 5 in combination with gemcitabine (1250mg /m2 when combined with cisplatin, 1000mg perm2 if combined with carbolatin) in a squamous cell histology or cispplatin (75 mg/ m2) or Carboplatine AUC 6 when mixed with pemetrexed (500mg or m2) in a non-plate epithelium. The primary endpoint was overall survival in patients with high PD-L1 expression (50% of tumour cells or 10% of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes) and EGFR and ALK wild type. Overall survival was significantly longer in the subgroup of 6 stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 250 high PD–L1 Expression and EGFR/ALK wild type (20.2 months) compared to chemotherapy (13.1 months) (HR, 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40 to 0.89; P=0.1. A randomised phase III study (EMPOWER-Lung 1 [952]) investigated the PD-1 inhibitor Cemiplimab, vs. platinum-based chemotherapy in patients who had NSCLC. Nie-smoking was excluded. Cross-over was allowed and was performed in 74% of patients. In an interim analysis in February 2020, 563 of 710 enrolled patients showed PD– L1 expression of at least 50% (22C3 of this sub-group of chemotherapy). In chemotherapy, 14.2 months (11·2–17·5) (n=280; hazard ratio [HR] 0·57 [0·42– 0·77]; p=0·0002). Median PFS was 8·2 months (6·1–8·8) for cemiplimab versus 5·7 months (4·5–6·2) for chemotherapy (HR 0·54 [0 ·43–0·68]; P<0· 0001). In a phase III study (CheckMate 026; [982]), 541 patients with untreated advanced NSCLC were randomised between platinum-based standard chemotherapy (histology-dependent) and nivolumab (3 mg/kg i. v. every 2 weeks). Included in the study were patients with PD-L1 expression to at least 1% of tumour cells. Excluded % of patients with activating EGFR mutation or ALK fusion. Primary endpoint is the PFS in the central review group of patients who had been negatively controlled by PD- L1 positive tumours. Expression ≥ 5 % showed no difference with respect to overall survival: 14.4 in the nivolumab group vs. 13.2 months in the chemotherapy group (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.80-1.30). A pooled analysis of KEYNOTE-001, -024 and -042 studies [983] evaluated the benefit of pembrolizumab monotherapy in elderly patients > 75 years. 132 elderly patients with PD-L1 expression > 50 % were considered in the analysis. First-line therapy with pembrolizumab resulted in an increase in overall survival compared with chemotherapy. Adverse reactions were less frequent with pembrolizomabmonotherapy compared to chemotherapy. The benefit was particularly strong in the subgroup of more than 50% PD-L1 expression (HR 0.37; 95% CI 0.24-0.58). So far, there is no study comparing monotherapy with pembrolizumab with chemotherapy/pembrolizab combination. In the Checkmate9LA study, patients with squamous cell carcinoma were also included. 6 Stadiium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) were administered in a 2:1 design 2 cycles of platinum-containing chemotherapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab for chemotherapy alone. In an experimental arm, nivolumab and ipilimumab were administered to the progress or occurrence of unacceptable toxicity as maintenance therapy in addition to the immunocheckpoint inhibitor combination, respectively, to improve overall survival of all histologies of 15.6 months vs. 10.9 months of placebo with either 1 month of placebo and 0,6 months of chemotherapy (the standard of placebo) and 1 year of placebo. ECOG 0-1 In a phase III study (KEYNOTE-407), 559 patients with good ECOG-PS 0 or 1 in a 1:1 design were treated either with a combination of paclitaxel or NabPaclifaxel, carboplatin and pembrolizumab or chemotherapy alone, regardless of PD-L1 expression. Following a median follow-up of 7.8 months, a significant improvement in median overall survival of 15.9 vs. 11.3 months {HR 0.64; p<0.001} was seen by the addition of pembrilizumab. The benefit was independent of the degree of PD L1 expression, and median progression-free survival was 6.4 vs. 4.8 months {H 0.56; p < 0.001}. Undesirable adverse reactions of Grade 3 and higher occurred in 69.8 % of patients in the pembralizumab group and 68.2% in the comparator arm. Adverse adverse reactions were considered with 13.3% vs. In the EMPOWER-Lung-3 study, patients with 2:1 randomisation received cemiplimab and up to 4 cycles of platinum-containing combination chemotherapy or placebo and chemotherapy, followed by cemiplimab every 3 weeks and placebo. 146 patients with squamous epithelial histology were also included. There was a significant improvement in response (47.9 vs. 22.7%), progression-free 8.3 vs. 5.5 months, HR 0.48) and overall survival (23.5 vs. 12.1 months,HR 0.51). Patients with squemous epitelular histologie and non- squamish epithelium carcinoma benefited equally. No benefit in overall survival was seen in PD-L1-negativity, and therefore only in patients with at least 1% PD-l1-expriming tumour cells was reported [965]. In the treatment concept of epoetin alfa, there was no benefit in the overall survival of PD-Negativity. In a 2:1 study design, the overall survival of nivolumab and ipilimumab to progression or incidence of unacceptable toxicity [959] was improved by the addition of niVolumab and ipilimumab to standard chemotherapy for 10.9 months (HR 0.66). Response rates were lower in the patient group with PD-L1 expression between 1 and 49% both with the triple combination (Keynote 407) and with the quadruple regimen (Checkmate9LA) than in the group of patients with more than 50% PD- L1 expressing tumour cells. However, in the longer term observation, it was observed that in particular 6 stadi ium IV V (without indication of definitive local therapy) 252 patients with less than 1% PD-l1 expressing tumor cells benefited from double checkpoint inhibition compared to chemotherapy. Another combination of two checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy was studied in the POSEIDON study [966] and led 04/2023 to authorisation. In patients with squamous cell carcinoma, platinum/gemcitabine or Nab paclitaxel were combined with durvalumab and tremelimumab. In the subgroup with plate epithelial histology (after exclusion of an EGFR mutation and ALK fusion and due to randomisation) in 124/128/122 patients, the combination of chemo- and double immunotherapy, chemotherapy and durvataxel and chemotherapy alone was compared. However, the majority of patients were not stratified after PD-L1 expression, which would have been of little significance due to the relatively small number of cases. Subgroup analyses revealed a better progression-free survival, provided that chemotherapy contained paclitaxel. The 5 year OS data confirmed the long-term benefit of the 4-fold combination of chemotherapy (HR ITT 0.76, CI 0.64-0.89) Peters et al 2023. The combination of double immunotherapy with chemotherapy resulted in a significantly higher discontinuation rate of 15.5% versus 9.9% in chemotherapy alone. The Durvalumab plus chemotherapy group had advantages in terms of confirmed response (41.5 vs. 24.4%), progression-free survival (HR 0.68 95% CI 0.52-0.90) and overall survival (H 0.84 95% CI 0.64 1.10) compared with sole chemotherapy. The discontinuation rate was 14.1%. However, the triple combination was not approved. The metaanalysis showed a significant improvement in combination chemotherapy and BSC In the metaanalysis published in 1995 11 studies, including 8 with cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy (778 patients). (725 patients) compared with 4 different cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens compared to BSC (HR 0.77; p=0.0006, median survival 8 vs. 5.7 months) [562]. In addition, two other smaller phase III studies demonstrate a significant survival advantage in favour of cispabine-based combination chemotherapy [563], [564]. One of these studies evaluated the quality of life; an improvement in cispidine-based combined chemotherapy was shown, but not with BSC [563). Thus, for patients in good general condition (ECOG 0.1), evidence of a 6 stadi ium IV V (without indication of definitive local therapy) 253 Survival advantage of cisplatin-based co-schemotherapy compared to bSC can be considered safe. Thus in patients in stage IV, chemotherapy to improve survival time, disease control and quality of quality of treatment can be offered as an option. Platinum-free versus platinum-free combination chemotherapy versus BSC. Therefore, in phase IV, placebo-containing combination therapy was studied in combination with a metageneration, 37. Accordingly, the treatment of the choice is platinum-based combination therapy. In contraindications against platinum-containing chemotherapy, platinum-free third-generation cytostatics combination therapy can be recommended. Evidence of nab-paclitaxel The benefit of nab-paclitaxel (=nab = nanoparticle albumin bound) has been studied in a phase III study in 1052 patients with stage IIIB and IV [985], [986]. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate. The study patients were stratified by stage IIIb vs. IV, age (under or over 70 years), sex, histology (plate epithelial vs. quadrofolio vs. octapine). There was a significantly higher response rate (ORR 33 vs. 25%, ORR ratio 1.313, 95% CI of response ratio 1.082 – 1.592, p < 0.005). In patients with squamous cell carcinoma, response rate was 41 vs. 24% (response rate ratio 1.680, 95%CI 1.271 – 2.221, p=0.001. There were no significant differences in overall collective progression-free and overall survival. In subjects over 70 years, subgroup analysis showed a significant survival advantage (19.9 vs. 10.4 months, p<0.009). Grade 3 neurocytopenia, neutropenia, arthralgia and myalgia were significantly less common among nab paclitaxel than among paclitaxel. In the paclitexel arm, there were fewer thrombocytopenies and anaemia. An advantage of nab-paclitaxle appears to be the shorter infusion duration and to be more effective on the basis of the use of steroids. of nab-paclitaxel appears to be the lack of comedication with high-dose steroids. The importance of third-generation cytostatic agents As a combination partner, the cytostatics of the second generation such as etoposide, vindesin, mitomycin and ifosfamide or the third generation suchas gemcitabine, paclitaxels, nab-paclitaxel, docetaxel and vinorelbin are available. Compared to best-supportive care, the third-gen cytostatic drugs in monochemotherapy have shown their advantage for overall survival [566], [569], and are now in combination with cisplatin as equieffective [570], the question of superiority of third generation cisplatin combinations compared to 6 stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy] 254 second-generation cis-platin was reviewed in a single series of studies [56]. In a series of phase III studies, no uniform outcome was reviewed [574] , [575], [623],[576], (585], and [579]. Three prospectively randomised studies show a significant survival benefit of third-generation combinations compared to second-generation combination (cisplatin/ vinorelbin versus cisplatin / vindesin [691]; carboplatin/ gemcitabine versus mitomycin, cispabine, ifosfamide) [579]; cispidine/ docetaxel versus cisplatin / vindasin In two meta-analysis, effects of third generation cytostatic agents versus second-gen cytostatics were investigated. A meta-analysed was the efficacy of gemcitabine combinations compared with monotherapy and two- or three-fold therapy of II and III. Docetaxel was statistically significantly superior to vinkaalkaloids for survival and toxicity [582]. This metaanalysis was updated on the basis of individual patient data and results in the same outcome in terms of clinical effectiveness [583]. Mono- versus combination chemotherapy Second generation cytostatic agents Two meta-analysis studies, mainly with second generation cytostats, demonstrate a significant advantage of combination therapy compared to monotherapy [596], [584]. Combination therapy results in a better response (20 - 35%) and a minimally improved 1-year survival (24.4 % and 21.7%), but with increased toxicity and therapy-associated mortality (< 1% vs. 2-3 third generation cytotoxic agents) Also for the third generation Cytostatic agents an advantage of the combination was shown over cisplatin monotherapy with improved response and survival [987],[650],] [654] In a meta-dialysis the issue of monotherapy v. Combination Therapy was evaluated to 262. Treatment duration Two randomised studies examined the duration of chemotherapy. A study should show a difference in the 6-month survival rate of > 33% and median survival time (MÜZ) from 4 to 6 months when comparing 3 versus 6 cycles mitomycin/vinblastin/cisplatin. No difference was observed (MüZ 6 versus 7 months; p = 0.2); however, in the comparative arm 6 stadi ium IV V (without indication of definitive local therapy) 255 received only 31% of patients 6 cycles chemotherapy [651]. In another study a difference was to be shown in the 1-year survival rate at 15%. The administration of 4 cycles of carboplatin/ paclitaxel versus continued administration of car boplatin / paclitaxel until disease progression. In the case of disease progression, a decrease in the frequency of one cycle is confirmed in both arms. Neither for survival nor quality of life could be demonstrated by the superlevancy of a therapy arm [652]. Metaanalysis, including all randomized studies that tested six cycles versus a lower number of cycles of platinum-based combination chemotherapy, is confirmed [652], [988]. Based on four included studies (1139 patients), the analysis (3-4 cycles versus 6 cycles) shows only a difference for the pro-gression-free survival (median) of 23 days (5.33 vs. 6.09 months; HR = 0.79, p = 0.007); but not for the remission rate (36.5 % vs. 41.3%; p = 0.16) or overall survival (8.68 vs. 9.54 months;HR = 0.94, p = 0.33). The response rate is slightly higher at 41.3 percent vs. 36.5%, although this difference is not statistically significant (p=0.16). As regards adverse reactions, the metaanalysis shows a higher rate of severe anaemia (> Grade 3) in treatment regimens with 6 cycles 7.8% vs. 2.9%). The significance of maintenance therapy concept of maintenance treatment was evaluated in relation to the first-stage treatment (p = 0.11). First-line therapy was either a continuation of therapy with a substance of first-line (continuation maintenance) therapy or a change of the substance after 4 cycles of a platinum-containing first-lines (switch maintenance) treatment. Background of this therapy strategy is the goal of reducing chemotherapy resistance, controlling the tumor by an extended exposure to an active substance and possibly using antiangiogenic effects and a change in antitumour immunity. The study of Fidias et al. set a milestone in the development of maintenance therapy. 566 patients were studied in this phase III study [957]. After 4 cycles carboplatin and gemcitabine there was a change maintenance (i.e. the immediate administration of docetaxel) vs. a standard second-line treatment with doceaxel in Progress. However, an improvement in progression-free survival from 2.7 to 5.7 months (p=0.001) was shown to have no survival benefit (12,3 vs. 9.7 months of survival with Progress. However, the study was not able to demonstrate a survival benefit. Only 31% of patients were able to obtain second-line therapy with docetaxel, which speaks for an advantage of the substance during early use. A therapy with paclitaxel or gemcitabine or vinorelbin could not demonstrate a survivor's benefit in maintenance therapy, with a significant benefit for gemcitbine in the PFS in the IFCT GFPC 0502 study [989], [990],[991], (992), [993],.[994]. [995]. Here was a continuation maintenance with gemcitabine with a switch maintenance with erlotinib and Best Supportive Care completed. The median PFS for Gemcitabin vs. erlotinib vs. The best 6 stadiium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 256 supportive care was 3.8 months (p < 0.001, HR = 0.56, 954 vci). The median OS for gemcitabine vs. erlotinib vs. Best Supportive Care was 12.1 months vs. 11.4 months vs 10.8 months. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma also showed a response to therapy without significant survival benefit. Factors that thus speak for a success of maintenance therapy are the degree of response to first-line chemotherapy, performance status, histology and molecular markers. There is still considerable need for discussion regarding the study endpoints, the number of patients receiving second-line therapy, the quality of life, the importance of a therapy pause as well as the costs of therapy. Objectives of treatment in stage IV are: • reduction of tumour-related symptoms and • prolongation of survival time. The importance of platinum-based combination chemotherapy against BSC alone (‘Best Supportive care') in relation to these points was demonstrated both in a meta-analysis and in further studies [996], [998, [999] [1000] [100] during the course of study, there were no differences in quality of living2 in the study. Patients included in these studies/analyses usually had a good general condition (ECOG 0-1). Retrospective meta-analysis of chemotherapy studies identified factors that were predictive of the effect of chemotherapy on survival. Positive factors for survival were the use of combination chemotherapy and use of cisplatin and/or taxan as well as good performance status (ECoG 0.1), oligometastasis, haemoglobin > 11 g/dl, age < 70 years, normal values for LDH, lactate and calcium. Also under ongoing therapy, regular controls must be performed to detect acute symptoms requiring intervention (bronchological intervention; palliative radiotherapy; pallitative surgery). For all patients with lung cancer, access to the above mentioned techniques and procedures must be ensured promptly. System therapy (second line) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma without therapeutic alterations of a second line therapy is the improvement of survival time and control of tumour-associated symptoms.",

      "text": "Strong Consensus 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication of definitive local therapy) 259 Background The receptors that play a clinically relevant role in lung cancer are PD-1 and PDL-1: The receptor PD1 is typically expressed on T cells, the associated ligand on dendritic cells and tumour cells. The receptor-ligand interaction leads to inhibition of cytotoxic effector function of T lymphocytes. The first immune checkpoint inhibitor approved for lung carcinoma therapy was the fully humanized anti-PD1 antibody nivolumab. This PD-1 antibody inhibits the PD1-PDL1 interaction and activates the immune system against the tumor. In the study Checkmate 17 [810], Nivolumab was evaluated in the second-line therapy of squamous cell carcinomas versus the standard-2nd line chemotherapy docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in a first-stage trial of combination of 0.1 III patients. The 1-year survival rate was 42% with nivolumab versus 24% with docetaxel. Response increased from 9% (docetaxel) to 20% (Nivolumab) (P=0.008). The median PFS was statistically significant at 3.5 vs. 2.8 months (nivolumaf vs. docexaxel) (HR 0.62; p<0.001). The expression of PDL-1, which was retrospectively studied in an exploratory analysis, was neither prognostic nor predictive for clinical development. Tolerability was significantly better with ni Volumab than with chemotherapy, treatment-related grade 3 adverse reactions were observed in 7% vs. 55% of patients (Niolumab vs. docetaxel). Also, the quality of life analyses were significantly more favourable for nivolumab than with docotaxel, but formal data on the efficacy of nivolumbab in plate epithelial carcinoma PS 2-4, as they were not included in the approval studies with control arm of chemotherapy, and were considered to be worse in terms of toxicity compared to 1 patient's dose schedule. Pembrolizumab monotherapy versus docetaxel for a significant prolongation of survival time (HR 0.71; median 1.9 months), an increase in remission rate and a reduction of severe side effects. Progression-free survival was not significantly prolonged. Pembralizumab is only approved in second-line therapy in patients with immunohistochemical evidence of PD-L1 expression in at least 1% of tumour cells. Adverse reactions in CTCAE Grade 3/4 for pembrolizab are loss of appetite (1 %), fatigue (12%), diarrhoea (11%), anaemia (9%), nausea (<1%), rash (<1%) and asthenia (< 1%). Atezolizumab is a monoclonal anti-PD L1. Atezolizumab was also the most common of all adverse reactions (both 14%) with pembrilizumab, followed by nausea (11%) and rash (9%) and diarrhoea (7%) in patients treated with placebo or placebo in the second-lines of the population. 0,73; median 4,2 months; POPLAR: HR 0,74; median 2,9 months), regardless of the detection of PD- L1 expression on tumour cells [10], [10]. Atezolizumab did not increase remission rates and did not prolong progression-free survival. The rate of severe adverse reactions with atezolizab is lower than 6 stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 260 on docetaxel. Adverse reactions in CTCAE grade 3/4 were significantly less frequent with a total of 37% on atezolizumab than with docexaxel at 54%. Fatigue (14%), nausea (95%), loss of appetite (9%) and asthenia (8%) were the most common of all adverse reactions among atezolezumab. In the Revel study, the anti-VEGFR 2 antibody ramucirumab was increased at a dose of 10 mg/kg bw every 3 weeks in combination with dozetaxel in 1253 patients with a previously treated NSCLC with the placebo/dotaxel combination. 1.4 months, HR 0.86), as well as for PFS (profit median PFS 1.5 months,HR 0.76), there was a significant improvement in increased bone marrow toxicity and fatigue [1008]. In the subgroup of patients with squamous cell carcinoma, survival was significantly increased from 8.2 months (docetaxel) to 9.5 months (Docetaxels and ramucirumab), HR was 0.88 [1008]. Another study included squamish cell carcinoma therapy with afatinib versus erlotinib, a substance approved for second-line therapy in squamic cell carzinoma [1007] [707]. The study included 795 patients with plate epithelium carcinomas in ECOG PS 0.1 after at least 4 cycles of combination chemotherapy. The primary endpoint PFS was statistically significantly better with afatinib than with erlotinib % (2.4 vs. 1.9 months, human Q.82 = 0.0427). The overall survival was equal to 2 weeks of placebo (range 1 vs. in both arms was similar with different focal points (afatinib grade 3 diarrhoea 10% vs. 2% in erlotinib, grade 3 stomatitis 4% vs. 0%). Acneiform exanthema was more common in errotinib with 10% vs 6% in afatineb. Afatinibi is approved for second-line therapy of squamous cell carcinoma since 2016. Given the study situation, there is a recommendation that patients who do not have contraindications against immunocheckpoint therapy should initiate treatment with PD1-PD-L1 inhibitors in Progress after a first-line combination chemotherapy without immunocological partners. This therapy has a direct advantage compared to docetaxel for all clinically relevant endpoints. The other substances and substance combinations approved in the second- line therapy (docetaxel, ramucirumab, docexaxel, afatinib) have been shown to be of benefit to all clinically significant endpoints, as well as to be used in the third-line of immunotherapy, although there is no formal evidence of this outcome in the study.",

ECOG2 describes hegeable and self-careful patients who are unable to work, but who are more able to work on the bedtime, so that the performance of the stools must be considered. In the ECOG Performance Score, tumour-related symptoms, but also pre-existing comorbidities, must be distinguished between reversible tumour symptoms and general health impairments. Presumably 30 – 48% of patients treated with NSCLC are found in the ECO G Performance Score (PS) 2 [1014], whereby the assessments of patients (48% of ECOG 2) and treaters (34% of ECO G 2) are only moderately consistent. Compared to other malignancies, the rate of PS 2 patients is significantly increased in lung cancer patients [10]. Usually, ECO G 2 patients are excluded from therapy studies, so that the data on this patient population is limited. For ECO G 3-4 patients there are no sufficient data for therapy. For some large phase III studies, subgroup analyses of included ECO G-2 patients exist, there are several phase II and III studies and a metaanalysis. In some studies, ECOG 2 patients and elderly (over 65 or 70 years) are considered jointly, but there are also differences between these patients with a higher frequency of exposure to the ECO g2 patient. The current ASCO guideline for 2017 for ECOG-2 patients remains undefined and allows for combination chemotherapy, mono-chemotherapy or sole palliative therapy for these patients [1015]. Further evidence regarding the recommendation of atezolizumab regardless of PD-L1 status (IPSOS; Phase III study; NCT 03191786) can also be found in chapter 8.6.3.3 Further evidence concerning patients with ECOG 2 is also found in the background text in chapter 8.2.2 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 263 Immunochemotreatment versus combination chemotherapy for ECO G 2 2018, Paz-Ares and colleagues ([813]) published a study comparing pembrolizumab or placebo in combination with paclitaxel or nab-paccitaxel and carboplatin. Chemotherapy was discontinued after 4 cycles. This study showed an advantage in OS with an HR of 0.56 [95 % CI 0.38; 0.82] p=0.003 (AD: + 3.3 months), the patient-reported symptom of dysphagia with an HR of 0.52 [95% CI 0.31; 0.86] p =0.011, patient-reviewed physical function with HR of 0.71 [95 %) CI 0.52; 0.96] P =0.028 and severe adverse events with HRs of 0.69 [95 percent 0.53; 0.90] P=0.006 in HR of 3.09 [95% CI 1.66; 5.77] p < 0.001 in immunomediated UEs [988]. The importance of monochemotherapy in elderly patients In elderly patients (> 70 years), randomised study (ECOG 2, 24%; > 2 years of comorbidities, 21%) was considered to be of monochemotherapy (Vinorelbin) compared to BSC. Tumorone-related symptoms (Schmerz, survival) were randomised in combination therapy, and significantly in combination. 2, 19%; > 2 comorbidities, 66%), combination therapy of gemcitabine and vinorelbin was evaluated in comparison to gemcitabin or vinorelbine monotherapy. A superiority (improvement of median survival time) of the combination compared to monotherapy could not be demonstrated [569]. Studies show that patients who cannot benefit from platinum-based combination chemotherapy due to comorbidity or general condition benefit from monotherapy with a third-generation cytostatic agent (symptom control; median survival period). The significance of combination chemotherapy in elderly patients Higher age (> 75 years) alone should not be excluded from platinum based combination therapy. The retrospective cohort analysis of a phase III study in which cisplatin was evaluated with different combination partners showed that in patients > 70 years without relevant comorbideness, cisplatin-based co-therapy had the same efficacy/ side effects as in patients < 70 years of age of Vrel. In this study, the oral administration of vinorelbin was statistically significantly worse for survival and progression-free survival than the intravenous administration of vinorelbin. This was particularly true for PS2 patients The subgroup analysis of a phase III study also revealed benefits in terms of survival in patients over 70 years of age with nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin vs. paclitaxels plus car boplatin (see evidence of Nab-pacltaxel). 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 264 System therapy in patients with non-platelet cell carcinoma without treatmentable genetic alterations System therapy (first line) in patients who have non-plattenepithel carcinomas without treatment genetic alteration The treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC stage IV should be systemic. An exception may be oligomestatic NSClc (compare Chapter 8.6.13). The following factors are taken into account: Histology (platenepithel carcinoma versus non-platene epithelial carcinomas) Detection of a therapeutic mutation or translocation (e.g. EGFR, BRAF, ALK, ROS1, NTRK, RET, MET, KRAS, NRG1, HER2 (ERBB2)), immunohistochemical PD-L1 expression as well as age, co-morbidities and general condition (according to Karnofsky or ECOG). The first-line therapy of a non-platenepithelial NSCLC with therapeutic mutation and translocation should be performed with suitable and approved Tyrosinkinase inhibitors (TKI) as oral therapy, for patients with non-blade epithelium NSClc without therapeutic driver mutation and in palliative treatment situation, was the platin-based combination therapy with a pemetrexed partial regimen, followed by either monotherapy or first-stage therapy in the absence of treatment. The results of these studies were largely so clear that ICI-based therapy represents the current standard of palliative first-line therapy for patients with good general condition (ECOG 0 or 1) and without further exclusion criteria. Immune checkpoints are orchestrated by a series of co-stimulating and co-inhibitor molecules that regulate the activity and effector functions of T lymphocytes. This complex construct controls itself under normal physiological conditions, but is manipulated during the malignant transformation [10] immune checkpoints, which are mainly represented by the surface proteins CTLA-4 and PD-1 as well as its ligands PD-L1, inhibit the T-cell function. Thus, the immune checkpoint mediated signal pathways lead to a reduction in T cell proliferation, cytokin emissions and secretion cytotoxic granula [1017]. In recent years, antibodies, called immuno checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) were developed, the T cell proliferation, the cytokin emission, and the cytotoxic Granula were to be tested. In Phase III studies, the use of ICI or ICI+ICI in combination with chemotherapy and chemotherapy+antiangiogenesis has also been reviewed.Pembrolizumab monotherapy (where PD-L1 expression is present in ≥50% of tumour cells (TC)) or atezolizumab (if PD- L1 expression occurs in ≥ 50% of tumor cells or ≥ 10% of tumour-infiltrating immune cells (IC)) and several ICI + chemotherapy(+bevacizumab) combinations are now approved for palliative first-line treatment of non-plate epithelial NSCLC (without driver mutation). 8.6 Stadi Empfeh A Level of",

In a 2:1 regimen, a total of 616 patients were randomised. The primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival. The therapy was independent of PD-L1 status, but stratified (<1% vs > 1%). Further stratification features were the platinum used (cisplatin versus carboplatin) and smoking status. In the PP arm, cross-over after progress was possible to be pembralizumab monotherapy, which was perceived by 40.8% of patients in this arm. The response of the overall group was 19.4% in the PP arms, while in the chemo-immuntherapy arm it was more than twice as high at 48% in the placebo arm. In addition, both PFS and OS for all three PD-L1 degrees of expression (<1%, 1-49% > 50%) were significant for the combination arm. In patients with high PD-l1 expression (>50%), the hazard ratio was 0.59 for the OS and 0.36 for the PFS. In those without PD- l1 expression, an HR of 0.51 for the OS and 0.64 for the PCS was observed. The toxicity (CTC grade 3-5 in the PP arm was 66.8%, in the chemo+pembrolizumab arm 72.1%, with CTC grade 5 (death) in both arms being around 7%. At 33.6%, more than twice as many patients in the combination arms had to stop at least part of the therapy than in the pp arm. No 6 stadiium IV V (without indication of definitive local therapy) were reported in this study. After 4-6 treatment cycles, maintenance therapy with pemetrexed in the PP arm or atezolizumab+pemetrexed in the APP arm was randomised to 1:1. Co-primary endpoints were PFS and OS (assessed by the investigator). PD-L1 status was not an inclusion criterion and was not stratified. Stratification features were the gender of smoking status according to ECOG and the chemotherapy regimen used. The primary endpoint PFS in the ITT population was significantly positive for chemotherapy with a PFS of 7.6 months (versus 5.2 months in the chemotherapy arm); HR 0.60, P<0.0001. In the subgroup analysis, all stratated patient characteristics were also significant in relation to better PFS under chemoimmun therapy. Only the population with liver metastases showed no significance with a HR of 0.77 (PFS under PP 4.0 months 4.4 months in APP). In the co-primar endpoint, however, the survival rate was not achieved in this population. There was a median survival of 18.1 months with 3-fold therapy versus 13.6 months with chemotherapy (HR 0.81, P = 0.0797). In the subgroup analysis of stratified characteristics, only the non-liver metastases group was significantly associated with an HR of 0.76 (median survival 19.9 months (APP) versus 14.2 months (PP)). In a phase III study (ImPower 130, NCT02367781) [662], the combination of chemotherapy (carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel (CnP) and atezolizumab compared to the sole chemotherapy (CNP) was randomized in a 2:1 regimen. In a total of 723 patients, the PD-L1 status was not an inclusion but stratification feature. Other stratification features were gender and the presence of liver metastasis. The co-primary endpoints were PFS and OS. As maintenance therapy, the CNP arm pemetrexed were all three weeks or best support to the CSC. In both arms, the response was 49.2% for combination therapy; 31.9% for the CNP arm. PFS was 5.5 months, in the chemo-immunotherapy arm at 7 months (HR 0.64; P<0.0001). Also the other co-primary endpoint OS was significantly positive for the EDT population with HR 0.79 (P = 0.033). The median overall survival was 13.9 months in the CnP arm, and in the CNC+Atezolizumab arm at 18.6 months. However, PFS did not reach any of the three distinct PD-L1 groups (high/ low/ negative) in the Significant group. In the CnP+ atezolizumab arm, eight patients (1.7%) died, one patient (0.4%) died in the CNP arm. Undesirable adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of therapy were present in the cnP arm at 22%, in the triple therapy arm at 26.4%. The safety profile of 6 stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 270 atezolizumab plus chemotherapy coincided with the adverse events of the individual substances without new safety signals. In a phase III study (ImPOWER 150, NCT02366143) [1032], [10]9], [1033], < 1034], 1,202 patients with NSCLC in stage IV were randomised to three arms: Arm A: Carboplatin+Paclitaxel+Atezolizab, Arm B: Car boplatin +Paclitaxel+Bezolizumab, as well as the liver status in the population. Population, PFS in a molecular subgroup (expression of genes PD-L1, CXCL9 and interferon-g (Teff-high)) as well as overall survival of the ITT population. The statistical design initially intended to test Arm B versus Arm C. If overall survival is significantly positive here, then Arm A versus C was evaluated. The PFS was significantly positive for the 4-fold combination compared to Sandler's scheme (Arm C). The median PFS stood at 8.3 months versus 6.8 months; HR 0.59; P<0.0001. The overall survival as a co-primary endpoint was also significantly positive with a median OS of 19.2 months for 4-therapy compared to 14.7 months for the Sandler scheme, HR 0.78; P = 0.0164. Finally, the third co-primary endpoint of TEFF-high in relation to arm B and C was also significantly positive (HR 0.505, P< 10,0001). In all three tested haD-L1 subgroups (PD-L-1 negative/ low) of 0.8 for a signioid. There was only a signifi cant trend between Arm C (4-fold therapy) and Arm A (chemo+immunotherapy) with a hazard ratio of 0.88 and a P-value of 0.2041. Response was highest in Arm B (4-time therapy) at 56%, in Arm A and C lower at 40% and 41% respectively. A particularly high response rate was seen in the subgroup of PD-L1 highly expressing tumours at 69% (versus 49% in Sandler's schema arm). Adverse reactions of CTC Grade 3-5 were highest in the arm of 4-time therapy at 60%, followed by Arm C (Sandler Schema) at 5%. The lowest toxicity was seen with Arm A(chemo + immunotherapy) at 44%. Also treatment-related deaths were most common in arm B with 3%, in arm C with 2% and in arm A with 1%. There were no new or surprising signs of toxicity. The 4-time treatment did not result in a more frequent discontinuation of therapy than 3-time therapy. For this clinical condition there were no signs of deterioration in the course of function. In a very complex phase III study (CheckMate 227 Part eins) [967], various questions related to the effectiveness of a combined immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy consisting of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every two weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/ kg every six weeks were addressed in a 6-arm design. This immuno-immune therapy was compared with chemotherapy. In the ≥1% PDL-1 expressing cohort there was another arm with nivolumab monotherapy. In <1% Pdl-1 cohort, another arm was treated with ni volumab+chemotherapy. The six arms were divided into two groups with PDL1 expression ≥1% (N = 1,189 patients) and a group < 1% PDL© guidance program Oncology Lungcarcinoma 224 long version of the indication 3.0. Patients, as well as PFS in TMB (tumor mutational burden; mutation load) selected populations treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab versus chemotherapy. Inclusion criteria were previously untreated NSCLC in stage IV without EGFR/ALK alteration and a general condition ECOG 0-1. Stratified according to plate epithelium versus non-plate epithelial carcinoma histology. Data on progression-free survival of cohorts with < 1% PDL-1 expression show a significant benefit for progression- free survival of patients treated with chemotherapy+nivolumab compared to chemotherapy alone. The median PFS was 5.6 months in chemotherapy+nivolumab arm and 4.7 months in the chemotherapy arm (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.56-0.93). In the non-plattenepithelial NSCLD subgroup, HR with 0.68 was significantly related to nivol. In tumours with a lower TMB <10 mut/MB, the Kaplan-Meier curves for the PFS for nivolumab + ipilimumab vs. chemotherapy were almost identical to an HR of 1.07 (95 CI 0.84-1.35). The median PFS was 7.2 months for the combination of nivolubab and ipilimaumab (if there is a TMB ≥ 10 mut/ MB). The overall survival of the Nivo-Ipi cohort with a PD-L1 expression <1% was 17.2 months versus 12.2 months for chemo cohort (HR 0.62; 95%CI 0.48- In the cohort with an PD-l1 expression ≥1% was achieved the primary endpoint OS. The Nivo+Ipi cohorte showed a mOS of 17.1 months compared to the chemo-comparative arm of 14.9 months (HR 0.79; p=0.007). In the group of patients with a POS unchanged status of 1 month. The approval application for the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab at EMA, however, was withdrawn by the company, so that no approval will be given here. In a phase III study (CheckMate 9LA)[959], 719 patients with NSCLC in stage IV were randomized in two arms: Arm A Nivolumab 360 mg all 3w and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg of all 6w, as well as systemic chemotherapy every 3 weeks over 2 cycles. Arm B: Chemotherapy (in non-plattenepithel-CA Pat. was this as in arm A Platinum + pemetrexed all 3W, but 4 cycles with a possibility of pemetreced maintenance therapy. Stratified after PD-L1 status, gender and histology, the primary endpoint was OS. This was achieved with an HR of 0.66, p=0.0006. The median OS in arm a 15.6 month and in arm group a 0.6 month, and the placebo in arm of 0.61 months. The OS data were positive with HR rates of 0.62 and 0.64 for both the PD-L1 negative group and for the group with PD- L1> 1%. In the PD L1 group >50%, HR was 0.66. mPFS data also showed positive 6 stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 272 compared to the treatment arm with 6.7 months vs 5.0 months vs. (HR 0.68). The length of response in arm A was 11.3 months vs 5.6 months in arm B, with curves already separated after 3 months. In terms of toxicity, a rate of CTC Grade 3/4 adverse reactions of 47% in the treatment arms vs. 38% in the control arm was observed. CTC grade 5 adverse reactions occurred in both arms with 2%. Due to the lower number of cycles of chemotherapy in the treated arm, fewer haematological adverse reactions were observed, but immunorelated toxicity with CTC grades 3/4 were observed in the skin (4%), endocrine organs (3%), Gastro-intestinum (6%), without liver (4%). After 4 cycles without Progress, maintenance therapy with CEM could be continued every 3 weeks for 108 weeks or until Progress (in approval, the pass was removed 108 weeks). Furthermore, pemetrexed could also be continued as maintenance therapy every 3 week when administered as a combination partner to pemetreced during the first four courses. 466 patients were randomized to 2:1 (in favour of the chemo-CEM combination). The primary endpoint was OS, particularly important secondary endpoints PFS and RR. Patients were stratified according to histology and PD-L1 status. Patients in stages IIIB and IIIC could also have been enrolled if they were not eligible for definitive radiochemotherapy. EGFR mutations and translocations in the ALK and ROS1 gene had to be excluded beforehand. The primary end point OS in the ITT population was significantly positive for chemo immunotherapy with a mOS of 21.9 months (vers 13 months in the chemotherapy arm); HR 0.71, PEMV was also significant with the IT population. The PFS was also significantly better in the chemo-CEM arm at 8.2 months (versus 5 months in the chemotherapy arm); HR 0.56, P<0.0001. In the stratified subgroup of patients with PD-L1 expression < 1%, the OS shows an HR of 1.01 (for PD- L1 expression grades 1-49% and ≥50%, HR of 0.52 and 0.51 in favour of chemo immunotherapy). Therefore, the approval did not include the patient group with PD–L1 <1%. Also, the second important endpoint RR was achieved and was significantly positive (OR 2.68 (95%CI 1.72-4.19); P< 0.0001. In a phase III study (POSEIDON, NCT 03164616) [966], in a three-armed design (1:1:1) platinum-based chemotherapy with platinum- based chemotherapy and durvalumab (DUR) were compared to placebo-based chemotherapy and DUR and Tremelimab (TRE) were either administered in the combination arms or in the 3 weeks. Carboplatin in combination with either pemetrexed or carboplatine with nab-paclitaxel was selected for maintenance treatment. Patients in the chemo-DUR arm received up to progression or unacceptable toxicity DUR (every 4 weeks). A single 5th dose of TRE (at the time of the 6th administration of DUR) was administered in the Chemo- DUR-TRE arm in addition to DUR in maintenance (every four weeks up to progress or inacceptable toxicity). Patients who had received pemetreexed in the induction phase could continue to be treated with pemetreced (up to Progress or unacceptable toxicity) in all arms every 4 weeks. EGFR or ALK alterations were excluded; apart from stage (IVA vs IVB) histology and PD-L1 status (≥50% vs. < 50% expression) were stratified. The common primary endpoints were PFS and OS 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 273 (both chemo and DUR versus chemo). PFS, and OS (Chemo+DUR+TRE versus chemos) were alpha controlled secondary endpoints.The primary endpoint PFS was achieved for chemo + DUR with an mPFS of 5.5 months (vs. 4.8 months in the chemo arm); HR 0.74 (95%CI 0.62-0.89), P=0.00093; the second primary endpoint was not yet reached (HR 0.86 (95%KI 0.72-1.02), P =0.07581. In the alpha controlled Secondary endpoints, both the PFS as well as the OS for the chemos + Dur + TRE treated patients were significantly better than for the patients in the chemotherapy arm. mPFC was at 6.2 months (ves.4.8 months chemo), HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.60-0,86), P=000031 and mOS at 14.0 months (c. (95% CI 0.60-0.86), P=0.00031 and mOS at 14.0 months (vs. 11.7 months chemo) HR 0.77 (95% CI 0.65-0.92), P = 0.00304. Histology, which was a stratification feature, only showed a significant difference for the group of non-plattenepithel carcinomas for the OS (Chemo+DUR+TRE 17.2 months ( vs 13.1 months chembo)) HR 0.70 (95% AI 0.56-0.87), but not for the squamous cell carcinoma (HR 0.88 (95%CI 0.68-1.16)). For the combination of chemo+ DUR, the OS was not significantly improved in any histological subgroup (compared to chemo). Therefore, the PD-L1 status was tested in the chemo + DUR+ TRE arm with respect to the OS both ≥50% and the <50% expressing tumors was significantly enhanced in relation to the chemi arm. Therefore, there was an approval of the combination from chemo plus DRE treatment in addition to PRE. Pembrolizumab was infused at a dose of 2 or 10 mg/kg over 30 minutes every three weeks and 10 mg per kg every two weeks respectively. The response was initially evaluated as a central assessment in 2016; in the last evaluation in 2019 as an ‘immune-related' response (irRC) by the investigators. 550 patients with advanced NSCLC were included, of which 101 were naïve therapy. Only this subgroup is explained. The responses were 41.6%, the tumour control rate (DCR) at 84%. A median overall survival of 22.3 months (17.1-32.3 months) was achieved. The median survival of the group with a high PD-L1 expression was ≥50% at 35.4 months, the group having a PD- L1 expression of 1-49% at 19.5 months. The 5-year survival rate for the group was 1L1 expression ≥50%, the placebo group was reported with 29.7%, the olanzapine group with 19%, and the placebo Group with 11%. The 5-year survival for the high PD-L1 expression group ≥50% was reported at 29.6%, compared with the PD- L1 expression of 1-49% at 15.7%. In a phase III study (KEYNOTE-024, NCT02142738) [964], [963],[1035], [9] with 305 untreated patients with advanced NSCLC, platinum-based standard chemotherapy (investigator's choice) was compared with pembrolizumab monotherapy (200mg i.v. every 3 weeks), including patients expressing at least 50% of their tumour cells PD-l1. Excluded were patients with EGFR activation mutation or ALK fusion. Crossover from the chemotherapy arm to pembrilizumab therapy was allowed in disease progression. Primary endpoint was the median PFS in the central review. The hazard ratio for progression was 0.5 (95% CI 0.37-0.68, p<0.001). The median overall survival was 30 months (95%CI, 18.3 months to not yet reached) in the pembrolizumab arm compared to 14.2 months (95%) CI, 9.8-19 months) in chemotherapy arm; HR 0.63; P = 0.002. The response rate was 274 pembrilizumab group 44.8% vs. 27.8% in chemotherapy group in the 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication of definitive local therapy). Treatment with pembralizumab was less toxic, both for all listed adverse reactions (adverse events grade 1-5; pembrlizumab 73.4%, chemotherapy 90.0%) and for severe adverse events (toxicity according to CTC 3-5; pembrolisumab 26.6% vs. chemotherapy 53.3%). New signals regarding the type of adverse reactions were not observed. The QLQ-C30 questionnaire showed a score of 6.9 for pembrolizumab and -0.9 for chemotherapy with a difference of 7.8 (P = 0.0020). Also, the time to worsening of symptoms was significantly longer with pembrolizumab than with chemotherapy (HR 0.66, P = 0.029). Most recently, a 5-year survival rate of 31.9% for the pembralizumab group was reported [1035]. In another phase III study (KEYNOTE-042, NCT02220894) [968], pembrilizumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy was evaluated as first-line therapy in NSCLC patients with advanced/ metastatic tumours. In the control arm, the primary endpoint was Hboplatin and paclitaxel, or carboplatine status and pemetrexed. Patients with a high PD-L1 status ≥50% were significantly better in the pembrolizumab arm than in the chemotherapy arm (20 months versus 12.2 months, HR 0.69; P = 0.0003). Overall survival data for the PD-l1 subgroups ≥20% and ≥1% were also significant. However, there was no difference in clinical relevance in the cohort of patients with a PD- L1 status of 1-49%. There was no significant difference in overall survival of the groups (13.4 months for pembralizumab versus 12.1 months for chemotherapy, HR 0.92 (95% CI 0.77-1.11)). Progression-free survival of PD- l1 highly positive patients was also significantly longer in the immunotherapy arm compared to the chemotherapy arms (7.1 versus 6.4 months, H 0.81, P = 0.0170). For the other subgroup (PD-L1) ≥20 and ≥1%), there were no significant differences in progression-free success. The CTC 3-5 toxicity was high in the placebo arm at 17.8 %. The toxicity of CTC grade 3-5 was equal to 17.8% in the pembrolizumab arm and 41.0% in the chemotherapy arm. At around 9%, the discontinuation rate in both arms was equal. In a phase III study (ImPower 110; NCT02409342) [962], in a 1:1 design 572 untreated NSCLC patients of all histologies were randomized to an arm A with atezolizuamb monotherapy or arm B with standard chemotherapy (plate: ciplatin/carboplatin + gemcitabine; non-plate: Cisplatin/carbotlatin + pemetrexed). After 4 or 6 cycles, maintenance therapy with atezolisumab (arm A) or pemetreced (arm B non-platte) was performed. Cross-over was not allowed. All PD-L1 expression grades were included in the MediaL1 period, but were stratified. The primary endpoint was the OS of the wild type patients (i.e. without EGFR mutation or ALK prolongation). (TC3 or IC3; N=205) a significant OS difference of median 20, 2 months in the atezolizumab arm vs 12.1 months in chemotherapy arm (HR 0.59; p=0.0106). Also for the extended group of TC2/3 orIC2/3 expressing patients there was still a significance (HR 0.72; P=0.0416). However, as in the KEYNOTE-042 study, 275 positive patients were likely to be affected by the high-PD-L1 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy). Also, the PFS as a secondary endpoint was signficant (mPFS 8.1 months A vs 5.0 months B arm) (HR 0.63; P = 0.0070). In a phase III study (CheckMate 026; NCT02041533) 541 patients with untreated advanced NSCLC were randomised to either one or two-week placebo-based patients. The study included patients with PD-L1 expression to at least 1% of the tumour cells. Excluded were patients with EGFR activation mutation or ALK fusion. The primary endpoint was PFS in the central review in the patient group with ≥5% PD- L1 positive tumor cells. The main endpoint of this study was negative with a PFS of 4.2 months in the nivolumab arm versus 5.9 months in chemotherapy arm (HR 1.15, P = 0.25. Also overall survival was not statistically significant with a median OS of 14.4 months in nivollab versus 13.2 months in chemotherapy (HR 1.02). Also for the subgroup of PD-l1 highly positive tumours (≥50% PD- l1 expression) neither showed significance for PFS (HR 1,07) nor for OS (HR 0.90) in a phase III study (EMPOWER Lung 1; NCT038540) [Sazer et al. Lancetology] were randomised with an A-B-BN-C1-Tyg. Crossover of chemotherapy to cempilimab was allowed in Progress. Co-primary endpoints were the PFS and OS after evaluation by an independent review committee. Intent to treat population also 56 patients who had PD-L1 status <50% in a validated retest were found, and 91 patients who did not have PD- L1 status because validated testing was not possible. The confirmed PD-l1 ≥50% group consisted of 563 patients who were specifically evaluated. The median OS was not yet reached at the time of publication (February 2021) for the Cemiplimab arm (Pat with PD- l1 status ≥50%); in the chemotherapy arm it was 14.2 months (HR 0.57). The PFS was 8.2 months (Cem) versus 5.7 months (chemotherapy) (HR 0.5%, p< 0.001). CTC Grade 3/ 4 side effects occurred in 28% of patients in the CimiplimaB arm and in 39% of patients were associated with Cmiprab arm chemotherapy. CTC Grade 5 toxicities that could be associated with therapy occurred in Cemiplimab arm in 9 patients (3%) and were cardiological in 4 patients. Conclusion: for pembrolizumab, two randomised phase III studies are available (for atezolizumab and cemiplimab one) that show the superiority of ICI in monotherapy compared to platinum-based chemotherapy in first-line therapy in patients with NSCLC with PD-L1 status ≥50% and TC3/IC3 respectively. Moreover, the incidence of adverse reactions among ICI (except immunorelated adverse reactions) was significantly lower than among chemotherapy; in addition, pembrollizumab represents a significantly better quality of life (no results for atezolizumab). Together with a 5-year survival rate of 29.6% for PD- L1 highly positive patients in the first line (from a phase IB study), pembrilizumab monotherapy is an important treatment option in non-plate-nepithelial patients as TSCLC and overexpression (1-D) of this group. For patients with a PD-L1 status of 1-49% (analog TC2/3 IC 2/3), the treatment is at best equivalent to chemotherapy. However, for this 6 Stadiium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 276 subgroup of patients with moderate PD- L1 expression is not currently approved. The latest approval is Cemiplimab, which was superior in NSCLC patients with PD-l1 expression of ≥50% of chemotherapy. An approval is also available here for patients with stage III who cannot perform radiochemotherapy. According to a negative study, there is currently no recommendation and no authorisation for the use of nivolumab (or other ICI) in palliative first-line therapy as monotherapy. Background 8.97-8.98 Regarding the duration of system therapy, only study data are available that are generally available for 4 cycles of combination therapy from chemotherapy + ICI, followed by maintenance therapy to progression or tolerable toxicity. In the combination of Igre III and duration of therapy, there was no difference in the incidence of 4 or duration of study. Data from Phase I studies showed no difference in long-term survival regardless of the duration of treatment. In the exploratory analysis of the survival of the Checkmate 153 study (Waterhouse), in which the continuous nivolumab administration (Arm A) to the Progress versus End after one year (ArM B), a significantly longer PFS (HR 0.42;) and OS (HR 0.63) for Arm A was studied. This benefit was independent of the response to therapy. Although the study was not adequately empowered to check effectiveness (the primary endpoint was safety aspects), the results show that stopping therapy after one years increases the risk of progression. However, the high risk of stopping therapy is the ineffectiveness of the ICI in a re-duction. However it is evident in studies that a reinduction in progression in 70% of patients is likely to lead to a renewed clinical response. However the clinical benefit is limited to patients who received ACI's regimens of treatment (ICI) were stopped by the first day of the trial. Conclusion: in palliative setting, 4 cycles of chemo-ICI should be administered. After interstaging without progress, maintenance therapy should be followed. In clinical studies, 2 years of overall treatment were usually performed. However, since there is not sufficient data on long-term survival, the clinician must speak individually with the patient in case of good tolerability and lack of signs of progress. ICI treatment can then be continued in individual cases until the loss of clinical benefit. Background Autoimmune Diseases and Viral Infections In all studies on palliatory first-line treatment of the NSCLC with ICI or chemo immunotherapy, patients with autoimmunal disease (such as rheumatic arthritis or chronic inflammatory bowel disease) 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 277 were excluded. Also patients with hepatitis or HIV could not be included. However there are more recent findings on patients with these risk factors, which are presented below, in order to obtain a treatment decision in a case with 14 autoimplant disease. Real World data show that up to 22% of patients with NSCLC receiving ICI have a history of autoimmune disease [1037], [1038]. Autoimmunes diseases in NSClc are also not associated with increased mortality [1039]. However, the efficacy and safety of ICI data is very limited in patients with autoimmunity disease, safety data nevertheless show that although tumour patients with Autoimmune disease had a higher incidence of immune adverse reactions, these were mostly mild and well controlled. Moreover, they very rarely resulted in discontinuation of I CI therapy [1040],[1041], [10]8], <1042] The incidence of adverse reactions of CTC grade ≥3 of 11% is similar to those of the overall population without autoimum disease [10]40, < 1042],<1041> Patients with N SCLC and autoimune disease have an incidence of ADRs of Grade ≥3 and ADR rates of 14%. This is slightly higher than the rates reported in ICI without clinical trials. In the case of HSCLC patients [1042], [1041] PFS and OS were similar for patients with and without autoimmune disease. Patients with active autoimmunity disease, however, had a shorter overall survival [1038], < 1040],< 1042] and [1040]. It remains unclear whether immunosuppressive treatment at the beginning of therapy for symptomatic patients treated with ICI is potentially an adverse survival effect [10 40],> 1042. Prospective surveys for this patient population (NCT03656672, NCT viral infections, especially Hepatis B and C, and HIV clinical studies in hepatocellular carcinoma in which ICI was used, showed efficacy regardless of viral status and no cases of HPV/HCV activation were reported [1043]. In another study with 14 tumour patients who had hepatitis B, no increase in ICI incidence was observed in ICR patients. In the NSCLC study, 237 patients were treated with ICI, of which 14% had HPV infection. The incidence of immunorelated adverse reactions was similar to the group of patients without HPV. However, there was more frequent CTC grade ≥3 hepatitis. (12.5% versus 1.9%; P = 0.0021) [1047]. 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 278 The incidences of lung cancer in HIV patients were generally higher than in the control group without HIV (IRR 2.38); possibly due to higher prevalence of smoking in HIV infected subjects [1048]. Overall, up to 40% of HIV patients are smokers, i.e. about twice as many as in the general population [10]49. In addition, the overall survival of HIV and lung carcinoma patients is worse than outside this subgroup [1050]. In a retrospective analysis of tumour patients with HIV who received ICI therapy (of which 30% were NSClc patients), the status of HIV was still well controlled. In addition, two prospective studies showed a well tolerable safety profile without viral reactivation and good activity in advanced tumours, including the NSCLC [1052], [1053]. ICI therapy can even hypothetically increase HIV specific immunity, as the immune system strengthened by immunotherapy can destroy HIV reservoirs that remain in the body despite retroviral therapy [983]. It is recommended to closely monitor CD4 and CD8 during ICI treatment. Background Non-ICI-based therapies If an ICI-based therapy is not eligible, but the patient is in a good general state (ECOG 0-1), platinum-based chemotherapy or monotherapy should be offered in individual cases. Therefore, in the following, individual aspects of palliative chemotherapy/combination chemotherapy are again illuminated. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy 11 studies, including 8 with cisplatin-based combined chemotherapy, were included in the metaanalysis published in 1995; therefore, in studies with cisplatin-based combinations, the survival rate of 0.7 shows that there is a significant improvement in the mean survival time. Survival time compared to BSC (HR 0.73; p<0.0001; median survival extension 6 weeks, or 10% improvement in survival after one year 5% vs. 15%) [682]. This is also shown by a randomised phase III study (725 patients) compared to 4 different cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (HR 0,77; p=0,0006, median survival 8 vs. 5.7 months) [683]. In addition, two other smaller phase III studies demonstrate a significant survival advantage in favour of cispabine-based combination chemotherapy [684], [685]. One of these studies assessed the quality of life; it showed an improvement in cispplatin-based combined chemotherapy, but not in BSC [684). For patients in good general condition (ECOG 0.1), the evidence for a survival benefit of a cispidine-based combinations of chemotherapy against BSC can therefore be considered safe. Considering the absolute low median survival increase, the evaluation of the general condition and the benefit of the patient and the information on the benefit and benefit of its special benefit. In view of the absolute low median prolongation of survival, evaluation of the general condition and patient preference as well as careful information on the benefit and damage of therapy is of particular importance. As a combination partner, the cytostatic agents of the second generation such as etoposide, vindesin, mitomycin and ifosfamid or the so-called third generation, such as gemcitabine, 6 stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) are available 279 paclitaxel, nab paclitaxel, docetaxel and vinorelbine and pemetrexed. Compared to best-supportive-care, the third-generation cytostatic drugs in monochemotherapy have shown their benefit for overall survival [686], [1020] and are now established in the combination with cisplatin as equi-effective among themselves [1021], <1023]. For the combination cispatinine/pemetrexide was shown in a randomised study for cisplatinity/platein placebo. A 1.4-month higher median survival time with cisplatin/ pemetrexed [1024] and led to authorisation for the treatment of non-platene epithelial carcinomas. The question of superiority of third-generation cispabine combinations versus second-generation cesplatin combinations has been reviewed in a series of phase III studies without consistent outcome [1023], [691],[652],.[692] , [693], < 694]. Three prospectively randomised studies show a significant survival advantage of third generation combinations versus two-generation combinations (cisplatin / vinorelbin versus cispplatin / vindesin [691]; carboplatin/ gemcitabine versus mitomycin, cisplatin, ifosfamide) [694]; cispidine / docetaxel versus cisplatin / vindisin [695]; two metaanalyses of the effects of bi-generation co-administration. Meta-analysis reviewed the effectiveness of gemcitabine combinations compared to monotherapy as well as dual or triple therapy of II and III generation substances. Separate analysis of the combined chemotherapy studies shows a statistically significant advantage for the combination of gemciteabine and cisplatin compared to the combination between platinum derivative and second generation cytostatic agent [696]. In a second meta-analysis, docetaxel versus vincaalkaloids (vinorelbin or vindesin) was compared in platinum-based combination therapy. Docetaxle was statistically significantly superior to vinkaalkaroids for survival and toxicity [1025]. This meta-analyse was updated on the basis of individual patient data and results in the same outcome for clinical efficacy [1026]. Treatment duration The time duration of chemotherapy was evaluated in two randomized studies. However, one study should show a difference in the 6-month survival rate of > 33% and the median survival rate (MÜZ) from 4 to 6 months in comparison of 3 versus 6 cycles of co-insustin/ven. In another study, a difference in the 1-year survival rate of 15% was shown. In the case of disease progression, the administration of carboplatin/ paclitaxel versus continuous administration of Carboplatine/ pactitaxel was evaluated. In both arms, the weekly administration of paclitaxel was switched to the treatment of both arms. Neither for survival time nor quality of life could be demonstrated the superiority of a therapy arm [1055]. Both studies reveal no benefit in terms of survival time or quality of living for treatment beyond four treatment cycles. In a meta-analysis conducted on an IPD basis (individual patient data) including all randomized studies that tested six cycles in the initial line versus a lower number of platinum-based combination chemotherapy, this is confirmed [10]56. Based on four included studies (1139 patients), the analysis (3-4 6 stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) compared with 280 cycles of 6 cycles only for survival, but 0,09 v. However, for the remission rate (36.5% vs. 41.3%; p = 0.16) and overall survival (8.68 vs. 9.54 months; HR = 0.94, p = 0.33), the response rate is slightly higher at 41.3%) vs. 36.5%, with this difference statistically not significant (p=0.16). Regarding adverse reactions, the metaanalysis shows a higher rate of severe anaemia (>Grade 3) in 6 cycles regimens 7.8% vs. 2.9%) Maintenance Therapy (Maintenance) The concept of maintenance therapy has been tested in several randomized trials in patients with good general condition (PS 0 and I). In order to prolong the effect of first-line therapy, either continuation of therapy with a substance of first line therapy (continuation maintenance) or change of substance after 4 cycles of platinum-containing first-lines therapy (switch maintenance) were investigated. The study of Fidias et al. set a milestone in the development of maintenance therapy. 566 patients were studied in this phase III study [957]. After 4 cycles of carboplatin and gemcitabine, a switch maintenance (i.e. the immediate administration of docetaxel)vs. of a standard second-line therapy with docetaxel in Progress was performed. However, an improvement in progression-free survival from 2.7 to 5.7 months (p=0.001) could not be detected (12.3 vs. 9.7 months (P=0.0853). The study was also not empowered to demonstrate a survival benefit. Only 31% of patients were able to obtain a second-lines therapy with didcetaxle, which speaks for an advantage of the substance in early use. Erlotinib vs. Best supportive care was 3.8 months (p < 0.001, HR = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.44-0.72) vs. 2.9 months (P = 0.003, HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.54-0.88) vs 1.9 months. The median OS for Gemcitabine vs. Erlotinib vs.Best Supportive Care was 12.1 months vs. 11.4 months vs.10.8 months. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma also showed a response to therapy without significant survival benefit. Pemetrexed was randomised to improve survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in two randomised phase III studies in maintenance therapy. In the first study (JMEN) after 4 cycles of combination chemotherapy and in the absence of progression in a pemetrexeed or placebo arm (witch maintenance). Pemetreced improved PFS (4,3 versus 0,40,0,0 vs. HR 0.50 (95% CI 0.42–0.61), p<0.0001) and overall survival (13.4 vs 10.6 months, HR 0.79 (95%CI 0.65–0.95), p=0.012). In a planned subgroup analysis, however, there was no benefit for patients with 6 stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 281 squamous cell carcinoma (n=128) but a 5 month survival benefit with pemetrexed (15.5 months vs 10.3 months; HR, 0.70; 95% CI 0.56-0.88; P=0.002) was achieved in the control arm. In the second study (PARAMOUNT), pemetreced after 4 cycles with cisplatin and pemetreked was not formally comparable to maintenance use of pemetrezed vs. in the relapse. HR 0.62 (95% CI 0.49–0.79); p<0.0001) and overall survival (13.9 versus 11.0 months, HR 0.78 (95%CI 0.64–0.96); p=0.0195). However, fewer patients received second-line therapy with pemetrexed arm or second-lines chemotherapy compared to the treatment arm. Chemotherapy-associated grade 3.4 adverse reactions were in the pemetreced/placebo arm: 9%/<1%,p<0·0001. Grade 3-5 non-haematological NW were higher in the Pemetrecd arm than in the placebo arm: 9 vs. 4%, p=0,080. The most common therapy-associated NW Grade 3-4 in the pegerexed arms was anaemia (4%), granulocytopenia (4%) and fatigue (4%) in the Placebo arm (<1%). The quality of life was not negatively affected by pemetreked maintenance therapy. Another study examined the principle of a switchopiasis with regard to the incidence of exercise. The primary endpoint was PFS, secondary endpoint OS. No maintenance therapy was administered in the third arm. All patients received pemetrexed therapy in Progress. The primary end point was significantly improved with gemcitabine (median, 3.8 v 1.9 months, HR 0.56, p < 0.001) and erlotinib (mediane, 2.9 vs 1.9 months HR, 0.69,P= .003) compared to observation. Survival was non-significantly improved. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib was studied in the maintenance therapy SATURN study [1058]. Erlotinibi was randomised to placebo after 4 cycles of a platinum dublette. PFS improved (12.3 vs. 11.1 weeks, HR 0.79 (95% CI 0.5– 0.82); p<0.0001) and overall survival in patients who did not have a progression equivalent to RECIST after baseline therapy (11.9 vs. This initially led to the approval of erlotinib as a switch maintenance in patients with stable disease after induction therapy. In a retrospective, exploratory analysis of the Saturn study, patients with an EGFR mutation showed a significantly better effect in PFS (HR 0.1, p<0.01; Erlotinibib vs placebo) than in the patients with your EG FR wild type (HR 0.78; p 0.019). However, not all patients had material for molecular analysis [1059]. In the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study IUNO, the benefit-risk ratio of maintenance therapy with erlotib after four cycles of platinum-based first-line standard chemotherapy was no longer considered positive in comparison with errotinib in patients who had not mutated NSCLC compared to erlot in Progress (HR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.22; p = 0.8183). The authorisation of first- line maintenance therapy was therefore limited to the first-level regimen of therapy. Factors that thus support the success of maintenance therapy are the degree of response to first-line chemotherapy, performance status, histology and molecular markers. Considerable discussion remains in relation to study endpoints, the number of patients receiving second-line therapy, the quality of life, the importance of a therapy pause and the cost of therapy. The importance of monochemotherapy In elderly patients (> 70 years) the significance of monoharmotherapy (vinorelbine) compared to BSC was assessed in a randomised study (ECOG 2, 24%; > 2 comorbidities, 21%) and the importance for monocheme therapy (vinorelbin). Tumor-related symptoms (pain, dyspnoea) and median survival time were significantly improved or prolonged, while chemotherapy-related adverse reactions (neuropathy; constipation) increased significantly. In another randomised trial in elderly patients (≥ 70 years; ECOG 2. 19%; >2 comorbidities, 66%) were shown to be associated with gemcitabin or Vinorelbin compared to monocymbine alone. Because of comorbidity or general state, platinum-based combination chemotherapy is not possible, and can benefit from monotherapy with a third-generation cytostatic agent (symptom control; median survival time). Cisplatin versus carboplatin in combination chemotherapy In a metaanalysis based on non-IPD (Individual Patient Data) 8 randomised studies were included, the cisplatin (75-120 mg/m2) + combination partners compared with carbolatin (in 3 studies 300-500 mg/ m2; in 5 studies AUC 5-6) + combination partner. Combination partners were in 3 studies etoposid, vindesin, vinblastin or mitomycin C and in 5 trials gemcitabine or taxan. The analysis of all studies showed a significant improvement in response rate for cispplatin (HRa 1.36; p < 0.001) without significant improvement of survival time. Subgroup analysis of studies in which gemcitabin or taxane was used as combination partner, showed for cisplatin a significant increase in survival rate (HRA 1.60, p < 0.001). In another metaanalysis on IPD (individual patient data) basis, 9 randomised studies were included (patient age median 60 years; ECOG 0.1 83%). Cisplatin shows a significant improvement in remission rate (30% vs. 24%; OR 1.37; p < 0.001) without significant improvement of survival time (OR 1.07; p = 0.1). Subgroup analysis of the studies in which gemcitabine, vinorelbin or taxan were used as combination partners shows a significantly higher remission rates for cisplatin as well as a significant increase in survival (OR 1.11, p < 0.05) [1061]. Metaanalysis shows that cispabine is significantly longer in combination therapy with another substance compared to carboplatin, and in combination with gemcitabin, taxane, or vinorelbine 6 stadiium IV (without indication of definitive local therapy) 283. Therefore, in initial treatment, a significantly greater remission frequency is preferred in patients with no excluded benefit. A recent update of the Cochrane metaanalysis [1062], which included 2 other randomized studies, further relativizes the benefit of cisplatin compared to carboplatin. Once again, no significant survival benefit for cisplan was found (HR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.82-1.20; 10 randomised studies, n=2515). Subgroup analyses for gemcitabine, paclitaxel and docetaxel also remained without a significant survival advantage. In another subgroup (meta) analysis of 6 randomised trials, however, neither the studies with bevacizumab, in which carbo Platin was frequently used as a combination partner, nor the data from pemetrexed combination therapy, which are not included in the basic chemotherapy standard in the combination of these N-Peplia tablets, nor in the first-line chemotherapy regimen. The data on the combination of nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin are also not included in the meta-analysis. The question whether the avoidable differences in platinum derivatives in terms of efficacy and tolerability are emphasized or weakened by the addition of one (or two) ICI to first-line therapy remains to be seen and cannot be answered at this stage. Therefore, in case of expected complications due to cisplatin or patient's desire for higher adverse reactions, combinations with carboPlatin are recommended. 8.6 Stage IV (without indication for definitive local therapy) 8.6.3.2 System therapy (second line) in patients with non-plate cell carcinoma without treatmentable genetic alterations",

Therefore, it should be noted that no prospective randomised study data can be used for this treatment situation. Docetaxel studies, possibly in combination with angiogenesis or multikinase inhibitors, were all based on platinum-based chemotherapy. In the treatment of previously treated patients with an advanced non-plate epithelial NSCLC, improved efficacy of a combination of angiogenesis inhibitor with chemotherapy was demonstrated in two randomised phase III studies, with nintedanib receiving alone chemotherapy. PFS +0.7 months, HR 0.79, in the population of patients with adenocarcinoma: median 4.2 vs. 2.8 months,HR 0.84) [1065]. At comparable survival time in ITT, a significant extension of survival time was found in patients with an adenocarcinomas (median survival time: 12.6 versus 10.3 months,HHR 0.83). In addition, a prespecified analysis of survival period of patients who had a progression within 9 months of initiation of first-line therapy showed an additional extension of the survival time for the docetaxel/ nintedanib combination compared to docetaxel (mediane survival time:10.9 versus 7.9 months, HR 0.75) [1064]. In a further exploratory analysis for primary progressive patients, HR for survival was 0.62 (medianic survival time : 9.8 versus 6.3 months). The PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI: 1.9–8.7) and the response rate was 58%. In the Revel study, the anti-VEGFR 2 antibody ramucirumab was compared with the combination of placebo/docetaxel at a dose of 10 mg/kg bw every 3 weeks in combination with docetaxel in 1253 patients with a previously treated NSCLC. Both for survival time (median survival time: 10.5 versus 9.1 months, HR 0.86) and for PFS (profit median PFS 1.5 months,HR 0.76), there was a significant improvement in increased bone marrow toxicity, mucositis and fatigue. In subgroup analysis of non-plattenepithel carcinomas, survival was 11.1 months vs. 9.7 months, PR 0.83) [1069] 6 stadiium IV V (without indication of definitive local therapy). 592 patients were randomised to treatment with nivolumab 3 mg/ kg bw every 2 weeks and chemotherapy with docetaxel 75 mg/ m2 every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall survival. This was significantly extended with ni Volumab compared to chemotherapy (12.2 vs. 9.4 months, HR 0.73, p = 0.002). The 1-year survival was 51% vs. 39% (Nivolumab vs. docexaxel). Nivolumab also showed a significantly improved response 19% vs. 12% (p=0.02). Regarding the PFS, there was no consistent picture, this was shorter with niVolumab than with dozetaxel 2.3 vs. 4.2 months), but the proportion of patients without progress was higher after one year with ni volumab compared with 1 % with doCEtaxel (19% vs. 8%). Ni Volumab's effect was dependent on PD-L1 expression, which was found to be more pronounced in 1 patient with an expression or an expression. In contrast, patients with PD-L1 expression > 1%, 5% or 10% showed a significant and increasing survival benefit compared to docetaxel with the extent of expression. Treatment-associated adverse reactions were significantly less frequent with nivolumab (54% vs. 10%) [1064]. Thus, it appears that immunotherapeutic approaches with checkpoint inhibitors are particularly promising in the detection of PD- L1 expression. Explorative analyses showed that patients with an activating EGFR mutation and low-smoking no benefit in treatment with ni Volumab. Nivolumab is approved in non-plate epithelial NSCLC regardless of PDL1 status. The second immuno checkpoint inhibitor tested in second-line therapy is the non-fully humanised anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab. In a phase I/II study, the response was 45.2 % [1070], compared with a phase III study. These data were reviewed in a phase III study against docetaxel [1063]. Only PD-L1 positive patients were included, the result of central testing had to be awaited, resulting in recruitment of about 60% of the screened patients. 1034 patients were enrolled, 345 received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 346 pembrollizumab 10 mg/ kg, and 343 docexaxel 75 mg/ m2. The median OS was 10.4 months with pembrilizumab 2. mg/ Kg, 12.7 months with Pembrolizalab 10 mg / kg, 8.5 months with docetaxel. The differences between pembralizumab and docetraxel were significant (HR 0.71, 2 mg /kg bg, p=0·0008, HR 0.61,p < 0·0001), respectively, with pembrolizumab or 4.0 months with pembrozumab 10/ kg b. Grade 3–5 treatment-associated adverse reactions occurred less frequently with pembrolizumab (13% at 2 mg/kg, 16% at 10 mg/ kg, 35% at docetaxel). However, the rate of immunomediated adverse reactions was significantly higher with immunotherapy (21.5 vs. 9.1%). 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 287 The third immunocheckpoint inhibitor, for which Phase III data are available, is the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab. This was evaluated in the OAK study in second-line therapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC of all histologies and independent of the PD-L-1 expression against the second-lines standard docexaxel. (IC) and the patients were divided into three strata based on expression levels: High Expression (TC3/IC3), Mean Expression ( TC1-2/IC1-2) and Missing Expression (TC0/IC0). From 2050, 1225 patients were enrolled in the study and randomised to atezolizumab 1200 mg i.v. every 3 weeks and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 i. v. every three weeks. The statistical design was changed during the study, and the number of patients recruited was increased from 850 to 1225. The primary endpoint was survival time in the ITT population (850 patients) and TC1/2/3 or IC 1/2/3 population. Median survival in ITT population with atezolozumab 13.8 compared to 9.6 months for docexaxel (HR 0.73, p= 0.0003), and 15.7 vs. 10.3 months in the TC 1/2/3 and IC 1/2/3 subgroups. Thus, the coprimary endpoints were achieved in the 4 months of chemotherapy in the population of 4 weeks of chemotherapy, followed by 4 % of the population in the same immunotherapy group of 4 months. The PFS was not improved as in the CheckMate 057 study with an HR of 0.95 and was nominally 2.8 months with atezolizumab compared to 4.0 months with docetaxel. Median survival was improved regardless of PD-L1 expression in all subgroups. The most significant improvement was seen in patients with the highest PD-l1 expression (TC/IC3, 16% of ITT, HR 0.41). EGFR-mutated patients had no benefit from immunotherapy (HR 1.24). Grade 3/4 adverse reactions occurred in 37% of patients with atezolizumab and 54% with severe immune-mediated adverse reactions (CTCAE grade ≥ 3) were significantly more common among atezolizumab (6.2% vs. 1%). Data on quality of life (Patient-reported outcomes, PRO) were available for nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolozumab. These were collected with the standardized quality of life questionnaires LCSS, EORTC QLQ C30, LC13 and eEUROQoL-5D. Time for symptom degradation/Health-related quality of Life (HRQo L): Although nivolumab treatment did not significantly improve the LCSS score at week 12, then docetaxel symptoms worsen statistically significantly compared to nivolumbab. [1067] In the Keynote-010 study, a statistically significant benefit of pembrolizumab was observed after 12 weeks of treatment compared to docetaxel of 8.3 points [95% CI, 2.42-14, 26]; P = 0.006 [1068] atezolizumab resulted in a delay of worsening of physical symptoms (HR 0.75) and improved numerically HRQo l. Overall, however, there were only moderate differences in both arms [1066]. 8.6 StadiK EKium IV (without indication of permanent local therapy) in higher age patients without age therapy. Here, biological age plays a role rather than other prognostic factors, often associated with older age. These include a worse general condition (ECOG >1) and/or comorbidities. In addition, chemotherapeutics can often not be dosed so high due to poor tolerability or slower metabolism and/ or therapy breaks have to be inserted. Here, many important therapeutic suggestions are already found in chapter 8.6.3.2 Patients with squamous cell carcinoma and ECOG2. Recommendations 8.87, 8.88 and 8.89 may also be referred to here, which also apply to patients with non-plattene epithelium carcinomas. Consensual recommendation tested 2024 In NSCLC patients with stage IV non-plate epithelial cancer and ECO G 2, who exhibit PD-L1 expression ≥ 50% of the tumour cells or >10% on immune cells in tissue samples, monotherapy should be performed with • Atezolizumab (≥ 50% of tumor cells or 10% of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes) or celim cell lines as a function of tumour cells (≥ 50%. Tumor cells or 10% of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes) or • Cemiplimab (≥ 50% of tumour cells) or - Pembrolizumab (≥ 50% for tumour cells), are offered as first-line therapy. Strong consensus consensus-based recommendation new 2024 NSCLC patients with non-plattenepithel carcinoma in stage IV and ECOG 2-3 or older patients ≥ 70 years can be offered in palliative first-lines therapy regardless of PD-L1 status monotherapy with atezolizumab.* * Cave: Off-label use Strong consensus background elderly patients Higher age (> 70 years) alone should not be an exclusion from platinum-based combination therapy ± immuno checkpoint inhibitor therapy. In this case, less biological age plays a role than other prognostic factors commonly associated with higher age. Therefore, there is a lower general condition (ECOG >1) and/ or co-morbidities. In addition, chemotherapeutics may be associated with poor tolerability or a stadi slow tolerity IV or with no indication. However, these patients group is frequently underrepresented in clinical trials. Therefore, there is little known about ICI therapy. In a meta-analysis in patients receiving ICI treatment, age was not a prognostic factor for OS (< 65 years HR 0.71; > 65 years of HR 0.69) [1071]. A pooled data analysis of three randomised studies (KEYNOTE-010, -024 and - 042) compared pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, focusing on patients > 75 years [983]. Pembrolizab also extended overall survival compared to chemotherapy in this age group (total population PD-L1 >1, HR=0.76, PD- L1 >50% HR 0.41) with 1 year OS comparable to younger patients of these studies. Also, there was no difference in the side-effect profile including immuno-related adverse reactions in the younger age group. Also in the Checkmate 153 study, which Nivolumab evaluated in pre-treatment patients, there were no adverse effects in the age group I72, even in the youngest age group of the population. The median OS was 9.1 months in the overall group; in patients >75 years even 10.3 months. Real-world data confirm that elderly patients have no disadvantage from ICI therapy. A retrospective study including 175 NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab showed no difference between older patients (75> years) and younger patients [Bagley S. et al. 2017]. In a phase III study (IPPOS; NCT 03191786) [1073], 453 patients were randomized to an arm A with atezolizumab monotherapy 1200 mg every 3 weeks or to arm B with chemotherapy monotherapy (either vinorelbin or gemcitabine after decision of the respective study centre). Therapy was continued to progress or clinical benefit. The primary endpoint was OS; stratification factors were histology, PD-L1 expression and presence of brain metastasis was excluded from either the baseline of the patient or of the age of the disease. The primary endpoint was achieved with mOS for atezolizumab of 10.3 months (vs. 9.2 months on mono-chemotherapy) HR 0.78, P=0.028. The 2-year survival was almost doubled with atezolizumab (24.3% on 12.4% on chemotherapy). In overall survival, atezolezumab was superior to chemotherapy in the subgroup of patients aged 70-79 years (HR 0.68). For the PD-L1 subgroups there was no significant difference, all of which were related to the OS on the side of atezolozumab (HR 0.81 TC <1%, HR 0.84 for TC 1-49% and HR 0.87 for T C ≥ 50%). Similarly, all EOCG PS subgroupes benefited from AtezoliZumab therapy (HR 0.34 for PS 0-1, HR 0.96 for PS 2 and HR 0.74 for PS3). Atezolizab was not associated with new or unexpected toxicities. In addition, CTC290 was administered with atazolizivab, but was not used with atizolizium prior to administration. Conclusion: ICI can be used in elderly patients >70 years. Also, the toxicity and immune-mediated adverse reaction are essentially not different from a younger patient population. To date, however, for first-line therapy there is only one approval for patients with PD-L1 over-premièred tumours (PD-L1) ≥50%). In older patients with high PD- L1 expression of ≥50%, a first-lines therapy with atezolizumab of monochemotherapy with respect to mOS and 2 year OS appears to be superior. However, older patients should also be treated more frequently in prospective studies with ICI. Sole chemotherapy The retrospective cohort analysis of a phase III study in which cisplatin was tested with various combination partners shows that in patients > 70 years without relevant comorbidity cispabine-based combination chemotherapy had the same effectiveness and adverse reactions as in patients < 70 years [661]. The question of whether oral therapy with Vinorelbin of an intravenous Vinorelbin was considered to be of a more than randomised duration in this study. This was particularly true of PS2 patients [578]. The subgroup analysis of a phase III study also revealed benefits in terms of survival in patients over 70 years of age with Nab- paclitaxel plus carboplatin vs. paclitaxel plus Carboplatine. In elderly patients (> 70 years) the significance of monochemotherapy (vinorelbin) compared to BSC was assessed in a randomised study (ECOG 2, 24%; > 2 comorbidities, 21%). Tumor-related symptoms (pain, dyspnoea) and median survival time were significantly improved or prolonged, while chemotherapy-related adverse reactions (neuropathy; constipation) also significantly increased. In another randomised trial in older patients (< 70 years; ECOG 2. 19%; >2 comorbidities, 66%) were seen to be associated with a combination of gemcitabine and vinorelbin compared to gemcitabin monotherapy or Vinorelbine non-religance. Because of comorbidity or general state, platinum-based combination chemotherapy is not possible, ECOG may benefit from monotherapy with a third-generation cytostatic agent (symptom control; median survival time). Background NSCLC patients in reduced general condition (ECOG 2) The definition of NSCLS patients in a reduced general state (ECoG 2) for the indication of palliative chemotherapy is difficult. ECOG 2 describes walkable and self-sufficient patients who are not able to work but who have more than 50% of the waking time on their feet, outside of bed or armchairs are [1013]. The ECOG Performance Score includes tumor-related symptoms, but also pre-existing comorbidities, so that possibly reversible tumour symptoms and general impairments of the health condition need to be distinguished. 6 Stadiium IV V (without indication of definitive local therapy) 291 Presumably 30-48% of the actual NSCCS patients are in the ECOG performance score (PS) 2 [10], whereby the assessments of the patients are clearly consistent with ECOG2 in terms. For ECOG 3-4 patients there are no data on therapy. For some large phase III studies, subgroup analyses of included ECOG-2 patients exist, there are some phase II and III studies and a metaanalysis. In some studies, ECOG2 patients and elderly patients (over 65 or over 70 years) are considered together, with overlaps, but also differences between these patient groups. In the elderly, more comorbidities and sometimes higher toxicity are observed compared to younger patients, so that in older patients, similar to ECOG 2 long monotherapy was considered as therapy of choice. Immuno-checkpoint inhibitors±chemotherapy Alessi et al. presented at ASCO 2020 a retropsive analysis of patients who received >50% Pembrolizimub in the initial line of PD-L1 [1074]. 16.7% (N=39) had ECOG-PS 2. There was a marked difference in the PSS, with the group of PS-2 patients with a significantly lower frequency of 7.4 months compared to the patients with an AZ2 incidence of 0.4. Conclusion: ICI based studies of patients with PS2 are rare. There are largely only individual retrospective studies available here. While individual patients with ICI monotherapy can benefit, this is recommended – unlike in old patients with good AZ – only as an individual therapy decision. The impairment of overall survival is also due to the fact that usually no second-line therapy can be administered anymore. Alone chemotherapy Not least due to limited data, the current US-ASCO guideline 2015 for ECOG-2 patients remains undefined and allows for these patients the combination chemotherapy, mono-chemo or sole palliative therapy [1075]. A) Subgroup analyses of larger phase III studies • Quoix 2011[1076] : Elderly, 27% ECOG 2: A French study compared to 451 NSCLC patients (Quoix 2011,) between 70 and 89 years of age monotherapy (VRB or GEM) with the combination of carboplatin AUC6 / weekly paclitaxel (90 mg/m2) was significantly longer than the combination, with a combination of 2 times, with an increase in toxicity. With more neutropenia and asthenia, median survival (10.3 vs. 6.2 months), and one-year survival (45% vs. 25%) were significantly longer with the combination. This survival benefit was also seen in patients over 80 years old and in ECOG2 (27% of the overall group, 121 patients). 6 Stadi ium IV V (without B © L e Indik B) Pha Leitlinication for definitive local therapy) 292 Le Chevalier T [1077]: A large phase III study involving 612 patients, including 20% of patients in PS 2, compared cisplatin (Cis) 120 mg/m2 every 4 weeks/vinorelbin (VRB) with cis/vindesin (VDS) and VRB-30 mg/ m2 weekly monogroup analyses showed that only patients in the PS 0-1 benefited from the platinum-containing combination, in PS2 monotherapy with a similar survival (1-yearly survival) of 1-fold (0.0% to 0.0%) of patients with PS 0-1. A subgroup analysis of PS2 patients from 2 randomised studies with cis/ifosfamide (IFO)/mitomycin (MM) (MIC) showed a survival benefit only in PS 0-1. Patients in PS2 on combination therapy experienced a more pronounced improvement in quality of life than in PS0-1 patients with MIC in the first 6 weeks. Out of 797 patients, 159 were in PS2, the subgroup analyses were not pre-planned Sweeney 2001, ECOG-2 subgroup [1079]: In ECOG study 1594, which compared various platinum-containing combinations (Cis/Pacli vs. Cis/Gem vs. Cis/Doce vs. Carbo/Pacilia), Pat. were initially included in the ECOG 0-2 (Sweeny 2001). Because in the initial 64 EGOC-2 patients, the rate of adverse events with Grade III/IV haematological toxicity was very high with over 50% of patients, these were subsequently excluded from the study. [1080]: In the phase III comparison, carboplatin/ paclitaxel versus paclitaxel mono (Lilienbaum 2005), PS2 patients were also included. The subgroup analysis of the PS 2 patients (18% of the overall group) showed a worse survival compared to the PS 0-1 patient. When comparing the monotherapy with the combination therapy, the combination resulted in a significantly better 1- and 2-year survival (1-J-ÜL: 10% vs.18%; HR = 0.60). 9% of patients in PS2 survived 2 years under double therapy, but none of the patients in PS2 under monotherapy. (Evidence Level: 2b) asse II studies in ECOG 2: Long 2007 [1081]: The ECOG Phase II study 1595 compared to 100 ECOG 2 patients in carbo AUC6/Pacli 200 (CP) with Cis 60/G. and renal insufficiency), but the response rates, progression-free time, the median overall survival (6.2 vs. 6.9 months) and the 1-year survival rate did not differ in both arms. Conclusion of the study is that platinum-based therapy is also practicable in ECOG II with but worse results than in better general condition. Kosmidis 2007 [1082]: In a phase II study was compared in 90 included and 83 evaluated PS2 patients with a mean age of 73 and 70 years Gemcitabine (1250 mg/m2 on day 1+4) as monotherapy or Gem 1250 in combination with Carbo (AUC3 d1+14, Wh. d28).

Result of this PS2 study was that unselectioned PS2 patients were significantly superior to chemotherapy with carbo/ pacli compared to profre- TKI therapy [1023]. In this subgroup of EGFR_FISH positive tumours (n=32), the PFS was significantly prolonged. • ABOUND-PS2 study: The ABAND-PS2-study included only chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC who had ECOG 2 (n =40). The aim of this phase II study is to investigate the tolerability and efficacy of a regimen consisting of 4 cycles of Nab paclitaxel (days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks) and carboplatin (AUC 5 day 1 every 3 week) followed by a nab paclitaxel monotherapy (day 1 and 8, every 3weeks). Full published data on the study are not yet available before C 1) Phase III studies in ECOG2 Unselection: • Reynolds PS2 [1084]: A phase III study in 170 PS-2 patients with a combination of GEM and GEM.

Noteworthy was the relatively favorable survival of 8 months with a 1-annual survival of 31% in both arms in ECOG 2. • Zukin 2013 ECOG-2 study [1086]: In the predominantly Brazilian randomized phase III study in Pat. in ECO G 2 compared with Pem and Carbo/Pemdi, the 9-month placebo was significantly better than that of 4 months in total.

Conclusion: In ECOG 2 without negotiable mutation, combination chemotherapy should be offered to patients wishing to therapy. The combination Carbo/ Pem is superior to pem monotherapy. (Evidence level 1b) Lee, TOPICAL 2012 [1087]: EGFR-TKI in unselected patients: In the TOPICAL Phase III study from UK to molecular unselec. Patients (38% Adeno-CA, 39% PLECA) in poor general condition ECOG (≥2) and/ or multiple comorbidities classified as non-chemo-suitable were 15% in the ECOG 0-1, 55% in the ECG 2 and 29% in the EcoG 3rd group. Survival (2.8 vs. 2.6 months), but no difference in overall survival (OS): OS: 3.7 versus 3.6 months, (HR=0.94; p value=0.46). In the predefined subgroup of patients with rash (Rash) after 28 days, a significant OS and PFS advantage was observed: (OS HR=0.76; p=0.0058, PFS: HR=0.66; P <0.001); median OS: 6.2 vs. 4.1 months; a rash developed 178 out of 302 patients (60%). (Topical Lee).The benefit for patients with Rash was demonstrated in all prognostic subgroups, such as ECOG 3 or older (over 75 years). The patients with detected EGFR mutation had the largest OS advantage in erlotinib compared to BSC (OS 10.4 mon. vs. 3.7 months). All patients with EGF2 developed an EGRA mutation of the combination of 2013 and 1202. The study ended prematurely after inclusion of only 57 patients and showed a clear survival benefit for the combination with a sign. better OS of 3.0 months (mono) vs. 5.9 months. Under the combination, the PFS and response were better without significantly stronger toxicity. The authors conclude that cisplatin in addition to gemcitabine improved survival in PS 2. etaanalysis A metaanalysis of Mörth et al. 2014 [1089], which evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of a mono- or combination first-line therapy in advanced NSCLC in PS 2, concluded that the platinum-containing combination therapy promises a significant survival advantage (HR 0.79) compared to monotherapy (11 studies, 1114 patients, Hazard ratio (HR), 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71-0.88). The survival benefit was only seen under plat content therapy (HR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.61-0.81). The metaanalysis speaks for the platinum-containing combination therapy in NSCLC patients in PS2. It is pointed out that toxicity is the importance of ev. toxicities and the discussion of the therapeutic goals with the patient. ienprogramm Oncology For example, Quioix (Carbo/weekly Pacli) and Lilenbaum (Car bo/Pacli) recommend the combination, while Le Chevallier recommends monotherapy with VRB for PS 2 patients. Platinum-based combinations are also applicable and tolerant for PS-2 patients in case of adequate organ function, but achieve worse results compared to PS 0-1 patients [1079], [1081]. Preferably used are Carbo / Pacli or Carbo/Pem. Candidates for monochemotherapy are gemcitabine, vinorelbin, carboplatin, paclitaxel and pemetrexed. Presumably different patient selection criteria in ECOG 2 require the partly contradictory study results. In the future, a more accurate categorization based on criteria such as age, kidney and heart function, and other comorbidities to better evaluate ECOG and to determine whether a patient is likely to develop a cisor carbolatinous chemo, a monotherapy or just activate Zumbi. System therapy in patients with activating mutation of the EGF receptor (ECOG 0-4) In Germany, approximately 10% of patients with non-plate epithelial cancer are diagnosed with EGFR activating mutations. The largest groups studied in the European area are the French data from Barlesi et al. [1091], the REASON study [1092], and the data from the Genomic Medicine Network [1093]. Genetic alterations are associated with smoking status, but the sole testing of patients who have smoked never or only slightly (under 10 pack years and more than 15 years of smoking stop) would result in 1/3 of the mutations not being detected [10]. Therefore, it is recommended that non-plattene epithelium cancer patients should be tested independently of smoking status for EG FR receptor mutations; patients with squamous cell carcinoma, who have never smoked or only smoked lightly, should also be tested for these genetic alterations.",

[1094, [111],] patients were enrolled in the study. with paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 6 (up to 6 cycles) and monotherapy with gefitinib 250 mg/p.o. up to disease progression. Primary endpoint: the primary endpoint was PFS, which was assessed by investigators and not independently. In the EGFR mutation positive group, the PFS was significantly longer with gefitinib compared to paclitaxel and car boplatin, the hazard ratio was 0.48 with a significance level of p < 0.0001. Secondary endpoints: Response: In the group with activating EGF-R mutations, the objective response rate (ORR) was 71% for gefititinib, 47% for pacLitaxel and Carboplatine (p<0.0001), whereas the ORR among gefitinib patients was 1%. Overall survival: Overall survival was not comparable with both arms (HR 0.90, but the total population of EGF-10). The quality of life was measured with the FACT-L questionnaire and the TOI. Both measuring instruments significantly improved the quality of health of gefitinib compared to chemotherapy (OR 1.34 and 1.78). Symptom control: The symptom relief was also determined using the LCS score, which showed a significant improvement in symptoms for the group of mutated patients as measured by the LCC questionnaire (OR 2.7, p=0.0003) FIRST signal: Phase III[1095] Patient selection: 309 patients with adenocarcinoma who had never smoked were included in the study. Methodology for the detection of EGFR mutation: EG FR Exon 19-21 mutations were determined by Sanger sequencing reaction from tumor DNA. The low rate of detected mutations is attributed by the authors to the high rate of cytological tumor samples. Therapy arms: The patients were randomised to the rate of patients with GEMcitabine 1250 mg/m2 d1 and Cisplatin 80/m2. and 8 and cisplatin 80 mg/m2 d1, Wh d 22 for up to 9 cycles and monotherapy with gefitinib 250 mg/p.o., randomised to progression of the disease. Primary endpoint: Overall survival was the primary endpoint, which was identical in the two treatment arms with HR of 0.932, p=0.604, 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 299 secondary endpoints: the median PFS was 5.8 months in the geftinib arm and 6.4 months in chemotherapy arm, the difference was not statistically significant (HR 1.198, p =0.138). The objective response rate for gefitib was 55.4% and 46% for chemotherapy (p=0.11). 45.3%. The quality of life measured by QLQ-C30 questionnaires with a high return rate was statistically significantly more favourable for gefitinib in the parameters \"body satisfaction\", and \"roll function\" and \"social function\". The symptom fit analysis was also favourable in the EGFR group of patients. EGFR mutation results were only available in 52 patients in the gefitinib arm and 43 patients in chemotherapy arm (31% of all patients). For the EG FR mutated patients (26 in the gefitib arm, 16 in the chemotherapy arm) there were numerical differences in PFS (8.0 vs. 6.3 months, HR 0.544, p=0.086). In the EgFR-WT group, the PFS was more favourable for chemotherapy compared to gefitnib (HR 1.419, p =0.226). The ORR was 84.6% for geftinib vs. 37.5% for chemotherapy (p=0.002). For the ECFR WT patients, the ORR amounted to 51.9% for chemotherapy and 25.9% to gefitinib (p =0.51). Regarding the primary endpoint of survival, no differences were observed between subgroups. Methods) included: NEJ002 study of Maemondo et al.[1096] Treatment arms: In this study, patients were randomised between gefitinib or paclitaxel/carboplatin therapy. Of the 198 patients were 126 (64%) women, 122 (62%) non-smoking, 184 (93%) adenocarcinomas, 3 (1.5%) adenosquamous carcinomas and 5 (2.5%) squamous cell carcinoma, 5 (2.5%) other, 1 (0.5) large cell carcinoma. Primary endpoint: Response rate and PFS were significantly improved in the gefitinib arm vs. chemotherapy arm (73.7% vs. 30.7%, p < 0.001 and 10.8 vs. 5.4 months, HR 0.3, p<0.001). Secondary endpoints: survival rate was numerically higher in the gefitinib arm than in the chemotherapy arm with 30.5 vs. 23.6 months (p=0.31). The adverse reaction rate Grade >3 was significantly higher in the chemotherapy arm than in the gefitinib arm (71.7% vs. 41.2%, p<0.001). Quality of life/Symptom control: Data on symptom control or quality of life in the study were not reported. WJTOG3405 Mitsudoliet al., Lancet Oncology 2010 [1097] 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 300 patient selection: In a second Japanese study 172 Pat, 86 Pat. per arm were included, with activating EGFR mutations. Methodology for detecting EGFR mutations: activating Exon 19 and 21 mutations were detected using different methods such as RFLP analysis, Cycleave method, Sanger Sequencing and peptide nucleic acid acid PCR clamp20 and PCR invader21. Treatment arms: patients received Gefitinibi 250 mg/p. or Doctaxel 60 mg/m2 of the endpoint was reached by 24. Secondary endpoints: The response rate was significantly higher in the gefitinib arm compared to the chemotherapy arm (62.1% vs. 32.2%, p<0.0001). Survival was still immature and not different in both arms. The adverse effect rate was higher than in the chemo arm. Quality of life/Symptom control: Data on symptom control or quality of life are not available. EURTAC, Rosell et al., Lancet Oncology 2012[1113] Patient selection: The EURTAC study is the only prospectively randomized study that investigated exclusively Caucasian patients. The study included 174 patients with a proven EGFR activation mutation of Exons 19 or 21, who had to be demonstrated with 2 molecular biological methods (sanger sequencing and fragment length polymorphism for exon 19 deletions/insertions and TaqMan approach to exon 21 mutations). Methods (Sanger sequencing and fragment length polymorphism for exon 19 deletions/ insertions and TaqMan approach for Exon 21 mutations) were demonstrated. Treatment arms: Patients were randomized 1:1 in the experimental arm erlotinib 150 mg/p.o. or a chemotherapy arm, the Gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 d1+8 + cisplatin 75 mg/ m2 or gemcitabine 1000 mg/M2 d1/8 + carboplatin AUC 6.0 or docetaxel 75 mg / m2 d2 + cisplatin 75 mg & m2 and docexaxel 75mg/ m1+ carbolatin AUC 6.0. Primary endpoint: primary endpoint of the study was PFS. In a planned interim analysis, recruitment was stopped as the endpoint PFS was statistically significantly different: erlotinib arm 9.7 months vs. chemotherapy arm 5,0,000 months of dosing. No differences were seen in overall survival, this was 19.3 months in the erlotinib arm, 19.5 months in chemotherapy arm. The toxicity profile was significantly lower in favour of erlotinib, 13% of patients in the Erlotinib arm and 23% in chemotherapy arms ended the therapy due to adverse reactions. Quality of life/Symptom control: Reliable quality of life studies are not available due to a low return rate. 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for permanent local therapy) 301 OPTIMAL[1104] Patient selection: In the Optimal Study 165 Chinese patients (adenocarcinomas 88%) and an activating EGFR mutation of Exone 19 and 21 and ECOG PS 0-2 were included. Methodology for detecting EGF mutations: Different methods were used, both classical Sanger sequencing, as well as a TayMan approach to detect Exon 21 mutations and RFLP analysis for detection of Exon 19 length differences in treatment arms. Primary endpoint: The PFS was statistically significantly improved with 4.6 vs. 13.1 months and a hazard ratio of 0.16, but no central review of the PFS in the study was planned. Secondary endpoints: Response rate was 36% vs. 83%, the disease control rate 82 vs. 96% (standard arm vs. experiement arm). The haematological and non-haematologic toxicity were significantly more favourable for experimental therapy. At a cross-over rate of 78% in the chemotherapy arm and 61% in the erlotinib arm, survival was not statistically significantly different, median survival in the experimental arm was 22.6%, in the standard arm 28.8%. Quality of life/Symptom control: quality of life analyses have not been reported. LUX LUNG 3[1101], [1103] Patient selection: In the LUX lung 3, 1269 patients (ECOG 0.1) were diagnosed with metastatic (wet IIIB or IV after UICC 6) were randomised to induce mutation. In 452 patients a mutation was detected, 107 patients were Screen Failures. A separate evaluation of the common mutations (Exon 19 Deletions and Exon 21 L858R) was planned. Therapeutic arms: 230 patients were randomized to treatment with afatinib, 115 patients received chemotherapy with pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/ m2 d1, Wh d 22. 26% of patients were Caucasians, 72% osthainates, 2% of other genetic origin. Primary endpoint: Progression-free survival in the experimental arm was 11.1 months, in the standard arm 6.9 months. Based on patients with a typical activating mutation (so-called common mutation) in the exons 19 and 21 was PFS 13.6 months in experimental and 6.9 month in the default arm. These differences were highly statistically significant. 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 302 secondary endpoints: Symptom control (Husten, pain) and quality of life analysis were significantly different. The response rate was 60 vs. 22%. Survival data: Survivability data were evaluated separately for common mutations, i.e. Exon 19 and Exon 21. For the exon 19 deletions, an advantage in median survival of 12.2 months (33.3 vs. 21.1 months, HR 0.54, p=0.0015) could be shown compared to chemotherapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed. No survival advantage was shown for the exone 21 L858R (Afatinib 27,6 vs. Pemetrexed 40.3 months,HR 1,3, p=0,29. Significant differences in post-study treatment between the two therapies were not present (76 vs. 86% for exon 19, afatinibib vs. Chemo arm, 81 vs 83% for exone 21, afatineib vs. chemo arm) [1101]. In the Lux Lung 3 study, Caucasians and Asiansians could not be compared for the first time in terms of survival. In the Lux Lung 3 study, for the first time Caucasians and Asians could be compared with endpoints in a study. Here, no differences between ethnicities could be observed with respect to survival. Lux Lungs 6 [1114]: Patient selection: In LUX-Lung 6, 910 patients (ECOG 0.1) with a metastatic (wet IIIB or IV according to UICC 6) adenocarcinoma were screened for the detection of activating mutations of Exone 18-21 and 364 were enrolled and randomised. The study was conducted exclusively in Southeast Asia (China, Thailand, South Korea). Methodology for detecting the EGFR mutation: Tumor material was randomized to the presence of an activating EGF mutation of Exones 18 to 21 with an ARMS technology (therascreen EG FR 29). The patients were stratified according to common mutations or uncommon mutations in patients. Based on patients with a typical activation mutation (so-called common mutations) in Exons 19 and 21, the HR was 0.25. These differences were highly statistically significant. Secondary endpoints: Symptom control (cough, air distress, pain) as well as quality of life analyses were better in the experimental arm. Response rate was 74.4 vs. 31.1%. Survival data: Survivor data were separately evaluated for common mutation, i.e. Exon 19 and Exon 21. For the exon 19 deletions, no survival advantage could be shown compared to chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine (Afatinib 19.6 vs. Pemetrexed 24.3 months, HR 1.22, p=0.34). Significant differences in the ‘post study treatment' were shown between the two therapies (Afatinib 19.6 vs. Pemetrexed 14.3 months and HR 0.64, p=0.0023). Chemotherapy arm, 52 vs. 67% for exon 21 afatinib vs. chemotherapy arm) [1103], [1114]. Metaanalysis: In the metaanalysis of Lee et al. JCO 2015, 1649 patients were evaluated for the endpoint PFS related to afatinib, erlotinib and gefitinib versus chemotherapy [1115]. Here, a statistically significant benefit was obtained for the end point PFS for the overall population (HR 0.37, CI 0.32 to 0.42). HR was 0.24 (CI 0.2 to 0.29) for patients with exon 19 deletions and only 0.48 (CI 0.39 to 0.58) for patients suffering from exon 21, deletions. Women had HR 0.33 (CI 0.88 to 0.38) vs. men HR 0.45 (CI 0.36 to 0.55). PS, age, Ethnie, histology had no influence on the PFS. In a second metaanalysis, in which individual patient data were received, Erlotinibib and Gefitinbib could not show a survival benefit in Exon 19 patients who did not have Tran 2020. 07/2020) included a total of 22 RCTs on TKIs afatinib, erlotinib and gefitinib as well as cetuximab and icotinib (no approval outside China). There were respectively advantages in progression-free survival (erlotineb: HR 0.31; 95% (CI) 0.25 to 0.39; 583 participants; high-certainty evidence; Gefitinib: versus paclitaxel plus carboplatin HR 0.39 ; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.48; 491 participantes high-certainty evidence), versus pemetrexed plus cardioplatin with pemetrerced maintenance a HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.74; 371 participents, moderate-certainment evidence). Afatinbib: HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.53; 709 participANTs as a high-serity benefit was also assessed in relation to subjects. Phase IIB Study Head to Head Comparison TKI: Lux Lung 7 [1117], [1118]. In a phase IIB, data on head-to-head comparison of gefitinib against afatinib were evaluated in 319 patients with Del 19 or an exon 21 L8585R. 319 subjects were randomized, afatinib received 160, gefitib 159. The primary endpoint PFS was statistically significantly improved after 27.3 months follow-up time (1 data section) in favour of afatinab (HR = 0.73; p = 0.0165), response rate was 70% vs 56%, p = 0.0083) in all mutations, 73 vs. 66% in exon 19 deletions and 66 vs. 42% in exone 21 L858R mutations. The rate of discontinuations due to toxicity was 6.3% in both arms.

In cases where there is high therapeutic pressure, therapy can be started with chemotherapy or chemo immunocheckpoint inhibitor therapy if molecularly unknown status. Then the question of continuation of chemotherapy or chemotherapy and immunocheck point inhibitor therapy is raised. Generally, this question has not been examined in studies. A study with erlotinib could not find any difference in the effectiveness of the EGF-TCI for patients who received erlotinib in the 1stline or 2nd line. Nevertheless, it is recommended to switch therapy from chemotherapy to the EgFR inhibitor due to better to better tolerance, lower toxicity and higher effectiveness [1122]. Uncommon mutations[1105] The atypical EG FR mutations These represent approximately 10% of the ECFR mutations and include majority mutations in Exon and Exon. Analysis of 32 patients from the LUXLung 2.3 and 6 studies showed a response rate of 66%, the DOR rate after 12Mon. was 52%, an extension of FDA approval was reported. In a large retrospective data pool of 693 patients, treatment with afatinib showed an ORR of 60% and a DOR of approx.17 Mon [1123]. The only prospective study was published in 2019 with osimertinib in 36 patients and an ORF of 50% and a med. PFS of 8.2 Mon. [1124] Exon 20 insertion mutations In Exon20 insertions, the first and second generation TKI are ineffective and should not be used (ORR (8.7%), PFS (2.7 months), OS 9.2 months) - reference!) An exception may be patients with an EGFR A763_Y764insFQEA insertion [1125). Patients with EG FR Exon twenty insertions are not treated in the first treatment line of EGFFR1 with a high dose of immunotherapy, whereas in the case of an EGFR1 with an expression. In the first line of therapy, such as EGFR-WT patients, monotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor should not be demonstrated (ref) in patients with high PD-L1 expression. Bispecific antibody avivantamab was able to achieve a response in 40% with a median response duration of 11.1 months, a median progression-free survival of 8.3 months and a median overall survival of 22.8 months after failure [111]. Further exon20-specific substances, which also lead to effective inactivation of the mutated EGRA in EG FR in EgFR 20, are currently being reviewed in studies [1105]. Efficacy with osimertinib in the double dose of 160 mg daily in a phase 2 study with a response rate of 25% and a median PFS of 9.7 months [1126]. No data are available for patients ECOG 3 and 4. These patients are not necessarily candidates for chemotherapy and often only conditionally for immunotherapy. For patients ECOG 3 and 4 no data are available. These patients are usually not candidates for chemotherapy and often only conditionally for immunotherapy. In view of the good tolerability of TKI therapy, testing for an EGFR mutation should be performed in these patients and TKI treatment should be offered if an activating EGRA mutation is detected. 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 306 EGF-TKI in combination with antiangiogenesis inhibitors: In a purely Japanese phase II study, the effectiveness of first-line therapy with bevacizumab and erlotinib vs. erlotinib was tested [1127]. In the study, approximately 1/3 of patients were active smokers, which is very rare in EG FR mutated Caucasian patients. The primary endpoint was PFS. The median PFS was 16.0 months vs. 9.7 months in the combination arm vs. Erlotinibi (HR 0.54, log-rank test p.o.a. (HR 0.54, log-rank test p=0·0015) The toxicity was significantly increased in the combination arm compared to the erlotinib arm, e.g. high blood pressure (60 vs. 10%), proteinuria (8 vs. 0%), bleeding (72 vs. 29%), fatigue (13 vs. (also severe adverse reactions (=/> CTC grade 3) were more common in the combined arm than in the control arm: high blood Pressure (60% vs. 8%), rash (25% vs. 19%), proteinurie (8% vs. 0 %), bleeding events (3% vs. 0.5%). The incidence of SAEs was comparable in both arms (24% vs. 25% in the controls arm) [1127]. Response rate was not improved at 69% vs. 63%, although there was a difference in the tumour control rate (99% vss. 88%, p 0.018). For survival time, there was no difference with a high proportion of censed patients. Quality of life analyses were not known in combination of 0,2 and 0,3 and 0 and 0. The mechanism of action of the combination is not explained by an increased response rate, about which resistance mechanisms occur after failure (see below) is not known. The combination was approved by the EMA in 2016. An application should be weighed against the standard of TKI monotherapy due to the uncertain data situation, the questionable transferability of the data to Caucasian patients in particular regarding toxicity, the lack of survival advantage and the absence of quality of life analyses. In a second phase III study, an anti-VEGFR2 antibody, ramucirumab, together with erlotinib in patients with common (Exon 19 or Exon 21) EGFR mutations, ECOG 0 or 1 and absence of CNS metastases against erlotinib alone were tested. Stratification characteristics were gender, geographical region, EGFR mutation type and EGFFR test method. Primary endpoint was PFS. 499 patients were enrolled and randomised, 224 to the experimental arm (Erlotinibi + ramucirab) and 225 to the control arm (erlotin placebo alone). Control arm: 19.4 months (95% CI: 15.4–21.6) vs. 12.4 months (11.0–13.5), HR 0.59 (95%CI: 0.46–0.76) p<0.0001. Toxicity related to Grade 3–4 treatment-associated adverse reactions was higher in the experimental arm than in the control arm: 159/221 (72%) vs. 121/225 (54%). Survival data are not available, the rate of T790M resistance mutations as an expression of acquired resistance was comparable in both arms. The data for EGFR-TKI and anti-angiogenic inhibitors did not change with the study, the final OS data should be awaited up to a general recommendation. Another study of Geftinib and Apatinib, a VEGFR TKI was submitted to ESMO 2020: 313 patients were enrolled (AG Arm, n=157; G Arm, N=156). Median follow-up was 15.8 months. The median PFS by independent radiological review was 13.95 v. The OS data were immature with a maturity of only (29.4% events. ORR was 77.1% vs. 73.7% in AG vs. G Arm (p = 0.5572). 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 307 Pts with an ex19del had a better HR for the PFS than patients with Exon 21 mutation L858R (HR = 0.67, 0.45-0.99; 0.72, 0.48-1.09). Pt's with a TP53 exon 8 mutation had a significant benefit from dual blockage (HR= 0.24, 0.06- 0.91). Grade 3-4 adverse reactions were comparable in the two arms, with the exception of an increase in blood pressure and proteinuria (46.5%; 17.8%) in the AG Arm. This study is the first to show prospectively an advantage for commutated patients by combination therapy. Future studies should therefore include TP 53 mutations as a stratification feature [1128.] A Phase II study that was better than TTibidin + 90, which was also considered to be significant for patients with BERB11. Patients were randomised, ORR was better at 68 vs. 54%, PFS was not better at 9.4 vs. 13.5 months, HR 1.44, p=0.2, the difference was not statistically significant. Angiogenesis-typical adverse reactions such as hypertension, proteinuria were increased as expected in the combination arm.",

Strong consensus Table 30: Recommendations on biopsy and rebiopsia in an acquired EGFR-TKI resistor Recommendations on Biopsy and Rebiopsia in an acquired EG FR-TAI resistance (see Chapter 6.6.10) For acquired EGF-TCI resistance and acquired resistance to ALK, ROS1 or RET inhibitor therapy, a recovery of tumour cell material for the determination of resistance mechanisms should be performed. In the event of acquired TKI resistance and negative biopsy or clinically unacceptable biopsy in relation to the resistance mechanism, a liquid biopsy should be carried out in addition to determine resistance mechanisms. Background Patients with an activating EGfr mutation develop a high percentage of detectable resistance mechanisms; after treatment with first/second generation EGFR inhibitors, a fluid biopsy is most commonly used to determine resistant mechanisms. After treatment with first/second generation EGFR inhibitors, the most commonly acquired resistance is due to an EGF-T790M mutation. This leads to an altered ATP© guideline program oncology (Lung carcinoma) (Lungscarcinoma ) long version - 3.0 March 2024 em R+ mab nz nenz 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 310 binding bag that allows the binding of ATP, but replaces the first and second generation TKI (Afatinib, erlotinib and gefitinib) from the binding bag. Further resistance mechanisms, e.g. MET amplifications, HER2 (ERBB2) amplifiers, and BRAF mutations, occur in approximately 20% of the cases. Also after treatment with the third generation inhibitor osimertinib which are increasingly described on and off-target resistance mechanisms. Examples of on-target mechanisms are the C797S and G4Mutation REPLIB. Therefore, the molecular treatment of rebiopsia should be carried out with a broad NGS panel, which allows for the most comprehensive analysis of potential resistance mechanisms. The target location for rebiopsia should be a progressive tumor manifestation, so that the most resistant cell clones can be detected. Rebiopsie should be defined more clinically than according to RECIST criteria, since often the therapy with the first or second generation TKI \"beyond progression\" can be continued. A tissue rebipsy is generally preferable as it has a higher sensitivity for the detection of individual mutations, including EGFR T790M, than a \"liquid biopsy\" (sensitivity approx. 65-70% compared to tissue analysis [1135]) and also a SCLC transformation can directly capture. If a tissue biopsy is not feasible, a liquid biopsy (NGS analysis of cell-free, circulating tumor DNA) should be considered, in order to maximize the chances of further targeted therapies. In all studies, the first one of Oxnard et al [1135] reported a False negative rate of liquid biopsy of about 30-35%. In a metaanalysis [1136], the pooled sensitivity of the ctDNA study is reported at 0.67 (95% CI: 0.64–0.77), the poolsed negative predictive value (NPV) at 0.80 (95%CI: 0.77–0.83), the positive predictivevalue (PPV) pooled with 0.85 (95% Ci: 0.82–0.87), and the pooling negative predictable value (NPV) at 0.60 (95%). The system therapy of EGFR+ NSCLC patients is based on the first line based on biopseven findings: if a therapeutical mutation is detected, it should be attempted to treat accordingly. Approval in this constellation currently exists only for osimertinib in the case of T790M mutation in the presence of first-stage/second-generation metabolites. For patients with an activating mutation and a T790M resistance mutation, a number of T7 90M specific substances are in clinical trial. Osimertinib (AZD 9291) is the first T789M specific substance approved by the EMA based on phase I/II data. AZD 92 91 was evaluated in an expanded phase I and II study in 253 patients, 31 patients were treated in a dose escalation part of the study, 222 in the expansion part of this study. In the T791M positive group, 61% (78/121 patients in phase I / II study) and 64% (68/107 in expansion cohort) were treated with CR or PR, in the T 790M negative group only 21% (13/61 patients). The preliminary PFS in the t790m + group was found to be 9.6 months, the PFS within the T790M negative class [1117]. In February 2017, the results of an open-label phase III study (AURA3, NCT02151981) were published confirming phase II data [1137]. 419 patients with T790M positive NSCLC with Progress following EGFR TKI therapy were treated either with osimertinib (80 mg/day) or with permetrexed +caboplatin/cisplatin. Following a median follow-up period of 8.3 months, a statistically significantly longer PFS (primary endpoint, 10.1 months vs. 4.4 months, HR: 0.30 [95 %CI 0.23-0]) was observed in the osimertinib group at the time of data collection and 79% in the control group. Significant differences were also observed in respect of ORR (OR.39, 95 CI 0.23-0.4). At the time when data were collected, there was a statistically significant increase in osimertiniB patients and in the monitoring group. In all subgroups studied (age > 65 years, gender, Asian vs. non-Asian, smokers/non-smoking, CNS metastasis, Exon 19 deletion vs.L858R). Adverse reactions (according to NCI CTCAE 4.0) occurred in 99% with osimertinib and in platinum-containing chemotherapy + pemetrexed at 99%, but with significantly less severe adverse reactions with osimertinib (grade 1: 33 % vs. 11%, grade 2: 42% vs. 41%, Grade 3: 23 % vs 47%). Among the most common adverse reactions (all grades/ > Grade 3) with ostimertinibe therapy were diarrhoea (41%/1 %), rash (34%/1 %) and inappetence (18%/1 %); nausea (16%/ 1%) and fatigue (16%/1 %). In the osimerstinib group, there were fewer treatment breaks due to adverse events (7% vs. 10 %) but also more fatal adverse reactions (1x. 10 %), but also lead to more fatal adverse reactions (n=4 [2 x lung failure, 1x pneumonitis, 1 x ischaemic stroke vs. 1 [hypovolemic shock)]. Data on overall survival (secondary endpoint) were presented at the ESMO 2019 Congress and showed a numerical advantage for osimertinib (HR=0.87, p=0.18, 2 year overall survival 55% vs. 43%), with the large majority of patients randomized to the chemotherapy arm having subsequently also received osimergib (cross-over rate 71%). NSCLC patients with EGFR and other driver mutations are relatively common (to about 50% average in different series) that progression is restricted to one or two locations (\"oligoprogression\", OPD), which can be treated by local therapies, predominantly radiation or surgery [1138], [1139],[1141]. Such use of ablative methods is consistent with the previous target of treatment. Prerequisites for the diagnosis and therapy of oligoprogression are adequate imaging, ideally with PET/CT and brain MRI. Following the use of the targeted treatment options, further system therapy of EGFR+ NSCLC patients is based on this of cases without driver mutation. Immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors has shown less efficacy in several studies than in NSClc patients with no driver mutation and a lack of survival advantage compared to chemotherapy alone [1142], [1009],[1143], [10]3]. The only exception so far is the Impower150 study in which atezolizumab was given in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin [1144].",

Patients with measurable CNS metastases had a response rate in the CNS of 17/21 (81%, 95% CI and 58 to 95%) in the Alectineb arm and from 11/22 (50%) to the CrizotiniB arm (95% Ci, 28 to 72%).

For patients who did not have CNS metastasis at inclusion in the study, the risk of CNS metabolism at inclusion was 31.5% for crizotinib and 4.6% for alectinib (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.06-0.22; p<0.0001). For patients that did not had CNS metabolites at inclusion into the study the risk was to suffer a progression in the CNS was 31.5 % for crizootinib, and 4.6 % for aectinib(HR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01-0.22; p>0.0001); for data closure, 35 patients (23%) in the alectinib arm and 40 patients (26%) were died in the crizotinib arm. The 12 month survival rates were 84.3% to 95% CI 0,06-0.22, p> 0,0001). The median survival rates were not achieved in both arms. Grade 3 to 5 adverse events were overall less frequent with alectinib than with crizotinib (41% vs. 50%). Undesirable events occurred more frequently with aectinib compared to crizotinib for the following parameters: Anemia: 20% vs. 5%, myalgia: 16% vs. 2%, increased bilirubin: 15% vs. 1%, weight gain: 10% vs. 0%, muscle and bone pain: 7% vs. 2 %, increased sensitivity to light: 5% vs. 0 %.

In the final study analysis, the investigator-median PFS was 34.8 months (95% CI 17.7–NR) for alectinib vs. 10.9 months (95%) CI 9.1–12.9) for crizotinib (ITT stratified HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.32–0.58;) The median follow-up of OS was 48.2 months for aectinib and 23.3 months for crizitinib. OS data remain unripe (37% events). mOS was not achieved with alectinib vs. 57.4 months with crizotineib (stratified HR 0.67, 95% CI, 0.46-0.98). The OS advantage of alectinib was also present in patients with CNS metastases at the start of study [HR 0.58 (95& CI 0.34-1.00] and in patients without CNS metastases [HR 0.76 (95% CI 0.45-1.26]. [1158] Brigatinib Brigatinib is an inhibitor of ALK and EGFR. It is approved for first and second line therapy of the ALK+ NSCLC. Brigatib did not lead to a significant increase in overall survival in the Phase III pivotal study ALTA-L1 compared to crizotinib, but did not result in a significant rise in remission rate and a significant prolongation of progression-free survival with a hazard ratio of 0.48. Brigat in the overall population; however, the incidence of ingestion and high crossover rate was not reached. In first-line therapy, Brigatinib compared to crizotinib resulted in a reduction in the combined endpoint of progression-free survival and death (HR 0.49; median not yet reached). Severe adverse reactions in CTCAE Grade 3/4 occurred in the pivotal study in 69.1% of patients receiving brigatinib. Severe adverse events occurring in more than 5% of patients were hypertension and elevations of CK. An increase in amylase and lipase was also observed. Pulmonary adverse reactions Grade 3/ 4 occurred early in treatment in 2.7% of patients. Brigatinib in second-line treatment after crizotinib was evaluated in the ALTA Phase I/II study, with 2 doses (90 and 180 mg randomised). 79/137 had an ALK + NSCLC, 71 of which had pre-treatment with crizotinob. With a median follow-up of 27.7 months, the investigator was evaluated at 14.5 months (95% CI], which reached 10.821 months, which was achieved in OS 47.6 compared to the median of 12.5 months. 9.2 months (7.4-11.1) vs. 15.6 months (11.1-18.5) , median survival 25.9 (18.2-45.8) vs. 40.6 (32.5) months. [115] The median intracranial PFS for patients with brain metastasis fraud 12.8 (9.2-18.4) vs. 18.4 (12.6-23.9) months.[115] In the single-arm phase II ALTA 2 study, patients with progression following alectinib or ceritinib were included. Out of 103 patients, the independent review committee was 26.2% (95% CI: 18.0-35.8), the median response duration was 6.3 months (95%CI: 5.6-not achieved, the median PFS 3.8 months (95%) CI: 3.5-5.8). Out of 86 patients who were progredient with alect inib, the IRC-ORR was 29.1% (95% Ci: 19.8-39.9); the mPFS was 3.8 months (95% CI: 1.9-5.5%). The IRC-ORR was 29.1% (95% CI: 19.8-39.9) and the mPFS was 3.8 months (95%CI: 1.9- 5.4). Thus, a limited effectiveness of brigatinib after alectinib or ceritinib failure can be expected.The most common AEs were CK elevations (32%) and diarrhoea (27%). [1156] Lorlatinib lorlatib at a dose of 100 mg tgl. p.o. was compared in the randomized phase III study CROWN with crizotinib (2x250mg Tgl. per o.) (n = 296). Primary endpoint was the progression-free survival assessed by a central blinded committee. The primary analysis was based on a median follow-up for the PFS of 18.3 months on which AACR 2022 was presented an update with a median Follow-up of 36.7 months. [115] Stadirium IV Vd was considered to be a non-responsible for the purpose of the clinical trial. The primary analysis showed a significant advantage of lorlatinib compared to crizotinib, the hazard ratio was 0.28 (95% CI: 0.19-0.41; p<0.001). The objective response rate (ORR) in the lorlanib arm was 76% (95% AI: 68%-83%), in the crizotinib arm it was 58% (95%CI: 49%-66%), in patients with measurable CNS metastases the intracranial ORR was 82% (95% CI: 57%-96%), and in patients receiving crizotinab it was 23% (95% KI: 5%-54%). CR (complete rremission) was found in 71% of patients receiving lorlatinib, in 8% of patients treated with crizotinob. The most common adverse events observed with lorlatib were hyperlipidaemia, oedema, weight gain, peripheral neuropathy and cognitive effects. Undesirable Grade 3 or 4 events occurred more frequently with loralatib than with crizotinib (72% vs. 56%), more than half of Grade 3-4 events in the lorlitib arm were elevations of cholesterol, triglycerides or both. The rate of discontinuations due to adverse reactions was 7% for lorltinib, and CrizotiniB was 9%. [1157] The analysis presented with the AACR 2022 confirmed the previously demonstrated efficacy with a median follow-up of 36.7 months. PFS Hazard Ratio in this analysis was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.184-0.388), a landmark analysis at 36 months showed a PFS rate of 63.5%. The hazard ratio for the time to intracranial progression was 0.08 (95% AI: 0.04-388). In this analysis, results were also presented separately after the stratification factor Baseline brain metastases. Of patients with brain metastatics at baseline, 72.8% had not yet experienced cerebral progression at 36 months (hazard ratio: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.037-0.268), of patients without brain metastase at baseline 99.1% were still free of intracerebral progression at 36 month (hazard ratio: 0.02; 95% AI: 0.002-0,136). There were no new safety signals in this analysis; the rates of Grade 3-4 adverse events were 76% vs. 57% for lorlatinib and crizotinib respectively; the toxicity-related discontinuation rates were 7% vs. 10% for lorlatib and crizolenib respectively. [Solomon et al. AACR 2022 Abstract CT223 ALK inhibitors of the 1st generation crizotinib + crizoinib are not shown in the initial lines of treatment, however, a higher level of NCR is achieved in the overall quality of life. However, a survival gain from crizotinib in ALK + NSCLC patients is suggested by registry data. Thus, in a cohort of the network Genomic Medicine of 168 ALK+ patients, median survival with chemotherapy alone (n=42) was 9 months, using crizotinib (n = 71) 31 months (HR 0.235 (95% CI 0.4-61.6, p < 0.001)[1148]. In the Profile-1014 study [1146], a Phase III study (n ~ 343) in patients with advanced untreated non-plattene pithel cancer of the lungs, treatment with crizotinob monotherapy (2x250 mg daily) with platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin 75mg/ m2 or carboplatin AUC 5.6 in combination with pemetrexed 500mg / m2 every 3 weeks, up to 6 cycles) was compared with crossover after chemotherapy failure to crizotine treatment. 6 stadiium IV V (without indication of non-responsitivity). An extension of overall survival could not be observed due to the crossover option (70% of patients in the chemotherapy arm were treated with crizotinib in Progress). CrizotiniB-specific adverse reactions included visual impairment, gastrointestinal adverse reactions, oedema, abdominal pain and asymptomatic liver function elevations. Up to laboratory changes were severe (CTC grade 3.4) symptomatic adverse reactions all in the low single-digit percent range (frequency grade 3.4 NW: increased transaminases 14%, visual problems 1%, diarrhoea 2%, edema 1%, vomiting 2%, headache 1%). A crizotinib-associated death in the whole study was caused by pneumonitis. Quality of life studies revealed a highly significant advantage for crizotinab. Quality-of-life analyses were seen with the QLQ-C30, QL QQ-LC13 and EQ-5 scores. The improvement of LQ, based on baseline therapy, was also significant in terms of efficacy (beginning of Crizotinib). A significant benefit (p<0.001) was also seen for symptom control (dyspnoea, cough, shortness of breath, pain (QLQ- LC13) [1146]. Ceritinib Ceritinib is a significantly better PFS, a higher ORR, a better reduction of symptoms and a better quality of life in the first-line treatment of ALK positive NSCLC patients compared to standard platinum-based therapy [1147]. An advantage for overall survival (probably due to the permitted crossover) could not be shown in the randomised study. In the ASCEND-4 study [1148], a phase III study (n=376) in patients with advanced untreated non-small cell lung carcinoma, treatment with Ceritenib monotherapy (1x750 mg daily) was significantly compared with platinum- based chemotherapy (cisplatin 75mg/m2 or carboplatin AUC 5.6 in combination with pemetrexed 500mg /m2 was superior to placebo. The ORR was also significantly superior with 72.5% vs. 26.7%. An extension of overall survival could not be observed (due to a permitted cross-over, 72% of patients treated with ceritinib or any other ALK inhibitor in the chemotherapy arm were treated with Progress). Ceritinibib– specific adverse reactions included gastrointestinal adverse reactions and asymptomatic liver function elevations. Up to laboratory changes, severe (CTC grade 3.4) symptomatic adverse reactions were all in the single-digit percentage range (frequency grade 3.4 NW: increased transaminases 17-31%, diarrhoea 5%, vomiting 5%) Quality of life studies showed a significant advantage for ceritinib. Quality of Life analyses were also performed with LCSS, QLQ-C30, QlQ- LC13 and EQ-5D scores based on the disease response. However, the improvement of LQ based on baseline therapy was significantly better with Cerittinib.",

ALK Positive NSC LCD patients Stage II should be excluded from studies. If this is impossible, however, the application of potentially effective substances should be considered in case. ALK resistance mutations in approx. 20-30% of the cases can be detected by a tumor rebiopsia, but many \"negative\" cases (i.e. cases without evidence of an ALK persistence mutation in rebiopsia) also respond to another ALK inhibitor. Therefore, all approvals of ALK inhibitors from second-line therapy are not linked to the molecular results of a rebioppsia. Nevertheless, a rebiopsy with NGS testing is generally recommended, since in case of a positive finding, the type of detected ALK resilience mutation (e.g. gatekeepers G1202R mutation in about 10% of cases) or any other off-target resistance (eg gene amplifications) is a rational prioritization of the 6 stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) is possible in 319 follow-up therapy options and possibly also provides prognostic information. Extended Access Programs. Treatment control of ALK+ NSCLC based on the molecular properties of the tumor is a very dynamic field and subject of ongoing studies, therefore it is definitely recommended to perform patient treatment in exchange with a specialized center. Based on phase II study data, several second (ceritinib, alectinib) and third-generation (lorlatinib) ALK inhibitors are now approved for the treatment of patients with crizotinib failures. Below these are listed in alphabetical order: • Alectinibi showed a response rate of 50%, a median PFS of 8.9 months (n=138) [1163] in a Phase II study. In patients with evaluable brain metastases, the intracranial response rate was 57% (n =35). In another Phase II trial, the response rate were 48% and the median PFS of 8.1 months (N=87). The most common Grade ≥3 AEs were laboratory changes including increase in CPK (8%, n=7/87), ALT (6%, n = 5/87), and AST (5%, n°4/87)[1164]. • Brigatinib showed a median PFS of 16.7 months in a randomised phase II study at the dose of 180mg/day (with a 7-day lead-in of 90 mg/day, N=110) and 9.2 months at the 90 mg per day (n=112) [1166]. Response rates were 55% and 51% respectively. In patients with measurable brain metastases, the intracranial response rate was corresponding to 67% (n = 18) and 50% (n ~ 26). In an earlier multi-arm phase I/II study, adverse reactions were observed in the cohort of crizotinib refractory patients (n°42) and a median pFS of 14.5 months (1167). The most common adverse reactions in the 180mg/day arm were nausea (40%) and diarrhoea (38%), headache (27%), cough (34%) [1166]. The most frequent Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs were hypertension (6%), CPK increase (9%), pneumonitis (5%), and lipase elevation (3%). • Ceritinib showed a 39% response rate in the randomised phase III ASCEND-5 study and a median PFS of 5.4 months (n=115) in crizotinib refractory patients [1168]. In the previous ASCND-2 (phase II, n=140) and ASCend-1 (phase I, n = 163) studies, ceritineb showed an aprech rate of 39-56% and a median PFS from 5.7-6.9 months [1169]. Adverse reactions were nausea (58%), diarrhoea (68%), vomiting (44%), fatigue (22%) and increased transaminases (22-23%) and weight loss (27%), however, were essentially not severe graduation. Severe adverse reactions (grade 3.4) included transaminase elevation (1-3%) and dyspnoea (2 %)[1168]. • Lorlatinib has shown a 70% response rate and a median PFS of 11.1 months in the cohort of crizotinibrefractic patients (EXP2+EXP3A, n=59) in a multi-armed phase II study.

The most common adverse reactions were hypercholesterolaemia (224 [81%] of 275 patients), hypertriglyceridaemia (166 [60%] patients), oedema (119 [43%] patients) and peripheral neuropathy (82 [30%] patients). The most frequent Grade 3–4 adverse reactions are hypercolesterolemia and hypertrichyceridaemia (each in 43 [16%] of 275) patients). Serious therapy-associated adverse reactions have been observed in 19 (7%) of 2 75 patients, and the most common were cognitive (two [1%] patients); among the 262 patients evaluated for weight gain, 80 (31%) had a weight gain of 10–20% compared with their baseline weight and 33 (13%) had an increase of 20% or more [1172]. 4 Therapy after failure of secondary and third-generation ALK inhibitors 7 Consensual recommendation should be tested in case of intergoprodication. 4 Treatment after failure of secondary and third-generation ALK inhibitors 7 Consensus-based recommendation tested 2024 In oligoprogressive cases, the possibility of local therapy should be examined in an interdisciplinary manner.

Consensual background After failure of therapy with secondary ALK receptors (Cerbium-based regimen) 6. Phase II study 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication of definitive local therapy) 321 (EXP3B-5) was the response 40% and the median PFS 6.9 months [1170]. In cases with evidence of ALK resistance mutation in tissue rebiopsia, both the response rate (69% vs. 27%) and the median PFS (11.0 vs. 5.4 months) were better than in cases with negative findings. The incidence of ALT resistance mutations in rebiopsia after failure of second generation ALT inhibitors is also higher (50-60%) than in rebiopsies after crizotinib failures. Again, the approval of Lorlatib in this situation is not associated with any NGS findings on follow-up TKI therapy, this time with lorlatiib, because it should be considered in each case. ALK resistance mutation (e.g. the G1202R Gatekeeper mutation in approximately 35% of all cases tested) or any other off-target resistance (eg MET amplification) allows prioritisation of the follow-up therapy options and, if necessary, provides prognostic information. In the event that the NGS finding from the rebiopsia results in another potentially therapeutic acquired alteration, the patient may be treated further in a study or off-label, or in the context of compassionate use or extended access programs. The therapy control of the ALK+ NSCLC based on the molecular properties of the tumor is a very dynamic field and subject of ongoing studies, therefore it is recommended that patient treatment be performed in exchange with a specialized centre. Brigatinib is the potential outcome currently available as a secondary generation ALK inhibitor, and is a follow-on of a phase II study (BRIG-2002) as a successor therapy of patients with less severe ALT generation failure. The results of this study will depend on whether a recommendation for Brigatinib as a follow-up therapy after failure is given by other secondary-generation ALK inhibitors. Real-world data from the Brigatinib Compassionate-Use Program, however, show that Brigatinab has a clinically relevant efficacy in many patients with Lorlatinib failures with a median time-to-next treatment of 7.5 months [1173]. As Brigattinib is also better tolerated than chemotherapy, a treatment trial with Brigatinob after Lorlatinib failures can therefore be considered in cases that previously had no Brigatminib. Similar to EGFR+ NSCLC, the benefit in the time-To-Next treatment (i.e., the delay in the response of EK to EK) can occur in approximately 50% of cases at 1-2 locations. Using local therapies, mainly radiotherapy or surgery, is also found in ALK+ NSCL at the time of TKI failure.",

For previously treated EG FR+/ALK+ NSClc patients, the immunotherapy with PD-1/PD- L1 inhibitors has shown a lower efficacy in several studies than in NSC LCD patients without driver mutation and a lack of survival advantage compared to chemotherapy alone [1142], [1143], [10], [1010], < 1009]. The only exception so far is the Impower150 study in which atezolizumab was given in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin [1144]. In four-fold therapy, the response rate of (in the majority of TKI-treated) EGfr/ ALK+ N SCLC patients was 71%, the median PFS and the median OS was > 2 years [971. This four-fold therapy is currently the only acceptable strategy for carrying out immunotherapy in ALK+ patients and is the only one explicitly approved by the EMA for TKI-pretreated ALK + NCSLS patients. Other treatment options are platinum-based chemotherapy (if applicable as a tripple in combination with bevacizumab) or monochemotherapy (see chapters and ). Pemetrexed appears to have the highest intrinsic activity among monotherapy patients, as in the second line study on the use of crizotinib vs. second line chemotherapy the response rate (29% vs. 7%) and the PFS (4.2 vs. 2.6 months) with pemetrexide were higher than with docetaxel system therapy in patients with ROS1 fusion genes (ROS1 + NSCLC) ROS 1 fusion gene is to be found in approximately 1-2 % of the NCCLC with adenocarcinoma histology. Recommendation tested 2024 grade patients with NSCLC stage IV with ROS1 fusion genes (ROS1 + NSClc) should be offered in the first-line therapy crizotinib or entrectinib. In CNS metastatic ROS-1 + N SCLC, entrectinib should be provided. nce [1175], [1176],[1177],.[1178], [...]1179], ...1180] Strong consensus background Three prospective studies demonstrate the high efficacy of crizotinib in patients with advanced ROS 1 fusion gene positive NSC LCD. 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication of definitive local therapy) 324 A US-American Phase I study recruited 50 ROS1, including 7 patients in the initial line therapy [11 75]. The effectiveness was as follows: 6% CR, 66% PR, 18% SD, thus 90% DCR. The median PFS was 19.2 months (95% CI, 14.4 -R) was equivalent to the baseline safety profile of RR. In a prospective European phase II study with 34 ROS1 positive patients, the ORR (investigator-assessed) was 70% (95% CI]: 51–85) and the median PFS 20.0 months (95%CI: 10.1–n.e.) with also good tolerability [1179]. In a retrospective European analysis, there were 29 evaluated ROS 1+ NSCLC patients treated with crizotinib, an ORR of 80% and a DCR of 87%, but the median PCS was only 9.1 months [1178]. Even if no randomised study results were available for comparison of crizotinib with chemotherapy, the recommendation is clearly based on the fact that both initial line and rezidive chemotherapy (see above) superior efficacy and early response of the IPI in favour of the first-line trials is used for the benefit of 1st-line studies. The approval is based on the integrated evaluation of 3 early (phase I,II) studies [1176]. The response rate (ORR) was 77% in 53 evaluable patients with advanced or metastatic ROS1 positive NSCLC, which were largely pre-treated but TKInaive; 05% CI 64-88), the median response duration (DOR) 24.6 months (95% CI 11.4-34.8). The drug was well tolerated, approximately one third had Grade 3.4 adverse reactions, often weight gain and neutropenia. 11% of patients had severe adverse reactions (SAEs), fatal adverse reactions did not occur. Noteworthy was CNS effectiveness with an intracerebral response rate of 55% (95% Ci 32-77), including 20% complete remission and a response duration of 12.6 months [11/76]. Due to the high CNS efficacy, which is not reported in crizotinib, entectinib is considered as a means of choice in ROS1 positive patients with Ebiosis regimens. Recommendation tested 2024 In NSCLC stage IV with acquired ROS1 TKI resistance, a tissue biopsy and/or a liquid biopsy should be performed for determination of resistance mechanisms. Consensus based recommendation assessed 2024 For systemic progress (with and without CNS metastases) with therapy with crizotinib, unless G2032R resistance mutation is available, primary therapy with lorlatib (cave: off-label use) should be offered. In G2032/R resistance mutation, treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy should be provided. Alternatively, inclusion in a study with a near-generation ROS-1 inhibitor (e.g. repotrectinib) or treatment with the multikinase inhibitor cabozantinib should be recommended. Strong consensus based recommendation evaluated 2024 If possibility of \"off-target\", ROS1-independent resistance mechanisms that are potentially systemic therapyrable (eg. activating KIT mutation) should also be offered in the case of clinical use of active tumours. Due to the possibilities of local therapy for CNS metastastastases, regular imaging of the CNN should be performed in ROS1+ tumours, including in asymptomatic patients every 3-9 months every 3 to 9 months, due to the possibility of local treatment for CNN metastases. Strong consensus background t x- 6 stadi ium IV V (no indication of definitive local therapy) 326 In ROS1+ NSCLC following crizotinib failure, the most frequent resistance mechanism is the gatekeeper G2032R mutation in approximately 40% of cases [1181]. The most effective substance today, however, is the next generation ROS 1 inhibitor repotrectinib (TPX-0005) repotrectinib (TPX-00005), which is a response in the majority (60%, n=5) of the G20 32R positive crizotinib-resistant cases in the first-in-human phase I/II study TRIDENT-1, the next-generation ROS I/ II study TRIDENT-1 (11182]. In contrast, lolatinibibib in G20332R positive cases, disease stabilization [n (n=n=4/4/4/44), 4 4 44 4 4 24 4 4; and 4 448, and 4 24 24 24 4 of the Phase11 and to be of the phase of the day 24 4 or of the dose of the ZN, and of the TT and of 4 4 of 4 of of the disease, and to of the 4 4 or 4 4 No of the routine of the r be were reported, as of the case, and the Phase 11 or of of 4 or 24 4 has of the IT, and is be reported, and can be used of the once every every 4 of, and be be reported of the Tri 4 of every 11 or be reported with with with of of of every every 11, and every 4 4. of every 12, even be reported every every every 12 every 4, even, and, and any every 4 every every 3 9, also every every 10 every The response rate for crizotinib-resistant cases was 44% for repotrectinib at the dose ≥160mg/day (n=9) and 35% for lorlatib [1184]. Another therapy option in the crizotinib-resistant situation is cabozantinib, which has shown an anpsrechrate of approximately 25% (n =4) and also activity against the G2032R mutation [1185], [1186]. Due to the not insignificant toxicity of cabozantib, approved in Germany for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, especially in chemotherapy-naïve patients, platinum-based chemotherapy in the recurrence after crizotinab should be considered. Patients with ROS1 fusion appear to be more likely to respond to chemotherapy than ROS1-Wild type patients, in 2 retrospective analyses, even if with very small cases, a high OS of z.T. was reported for only chemotherapy-treated ROS1, preferably for pemetrexed-proportantin chemotherapy, also reported in the first 12 weeks of therapy. In a phase I/ II study of 69 ROS1 positive patients, efficacy was strongly dependent on the treatment line. ORR in TKI naive patients was 62% (95% CI 38-82), in 40 crizotinib-pretreated patients only 35% (without knowledge of resistance mutation status). Intracranial response was comparable to 64% in TCI-naïve patients and 50% in crizotinib-pre-treated patients. Alternatives and options in sequential therapy are chemotherapy as described above. Cabozantinib (off label) and repotrectinib (clinical study). entrectinib (Chapter 8.6.6) is not effective against known resistance mutations against crizotineib. Repotrectinib is generally well tolerated with dizziness (49%), dysgeusia (48%), paraesthesia (28%), and constipation (20%) as the main side effects in Phase I/II study [1182]. The adverse reactions of lorlatib are similar to those in the treatment of ALK+ NSC Obligosis (afg). asymptomatic), ALT (8%), AST (8%) thrombopenia (8%) and hypophosphataemia (8%); and the need for dose reduction in approximately 73% of patients [1189]. In line with the strategy of therapy for EGFR+ and ALK+ NSCLC, local therapy should also be considered for ROS1+ N SCLC after extensive imaging using PET/CT and brain MRI (see chapter xx) [1190]. If the NGS finding results in other potentially therapeutic acquired alterations, the patient may be further treated in a study or off-label or in the context of compassionate use or extended access programs, but this is still rare in ROS1+ NCCLC compared to EG FR+ and ALK+ NCSCLC [1181], [1191]. When a molecularly targeted treatment option is no longer possible, these patients will be treated with EGFR/ALK-negative NSCLD (level of Bfematicalc chemotherapy).",

Until now, the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib was approved in patients with non-resectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600 mutation. In April 2017, the European Commission approved the combination between dabrafenib and trametinib for patients with advanced NSCLC with a BRAF-V600 mutation; in a retrospective European cohort study of n=35 patients with Advanced BRAF positive NSClc (83% V600E, 17% other mutations), a response rate (ORR) of 53% (95% CI: 35-70) and a disease control rate (DCR) of 85% (95%CI: 69-95%) was observed in the first line (14%) or in the relapse (86%), and a response rates (ORF) of 43% (95%) CI-70 and a pre-treatment rate of 85% (95% Ci: 69-95%).

Data from the pivotal study In the pivotal trial, data from a total of 135 patients with advanced lung cancer and a BRAF V600 mutation 6 Stadiium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) were evaluated 328. The study included two arms: in one arm n=78 patients received dabrafenib, in the other arm n =57 patients received a combination of dabrafenib and trametinib. In the monotherapy study with dabravenib, the response rate amounted to 33% (95% Ci: 23- 45%) in n=26 patients treated with BRAFV600E positive relapsed NSCLC [1195]. The PFS was 5.5 Mo (95% ci: 3.4 – 7.3 Mo), the median survival time (OS) was 12.7 MoC: 7. Grade >3 UAW: cutaneous squamous epithelium (12%), asthenia (5%) and basal cell carcinoma (5%). Historical cohorts are available for comparison with cytostatic second-line chemotherapy in BRAF mutated NSCLC patients: 59 patients showed a response rate of 9% and a median PFS of 3.1 Mo (95% CI 1.4- 6.1 Mo) [1196]. In the other arm of the study, the combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) and the MEK inhibitor trametinib (2 mg once daily) was used in previously treated BRAF V600E positive NSClc patients. The response rate (=primary endpoint) was 63.2 % (95%CI: 49.3-75.6 %; 36/57 patients). The PFS was 97% CI: 6.9-19.6 Mo. Table epithelial carcinomas of the skin occurred in 2 patients (4%). A patient died of intracranial haemorrhage. These studies demonstrate that • targeted system therapy with BRAF mutation could be significantly superior to efficacy of cytostatic chemotherapy (direct comparison is missing) • dual MAPK pathway blockade (MAPK=mitogen-activated protein kinase) with dabrafenib and trametinib related to response rates and progression-free survival is more effective than dabrafenib monotherapy • tolerability of combination therapy is significantly better than that of monotherapy with darafenib • the combination dabrafenib and trametinib due to their efficacy constitutes an important therapeutic option in BRAF-V600E positive NSCLC. The results for the efficacy of dabrafib/ trametibib in the first line therapy of BRAF V600E-positive NSClc were published in 2017 [1192].

In the GEOMETRY mono-1 Phase II study, a 41% (95% CI 29-53) ORR was observed in 69 previously treated MEDex14 patients with capmatinib, the median response duration (mDOR) was 9.7 months (95%CI 5.6 – 13). In 28 treatment-naïve 6 Stadiium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 332 patients (9. The PFS was 5.42 months in patients previously treated and 9.7 months in first line CI. Out of 13 patients with CNS metastases, 7 (54%) responded well. Treatment was relatively well tolerated, the most common adverse reactions were peripheral oedema in 42% of patients (7% grade 3.4) and nausea in 45% of patients, mostly grade 1.2. [1209]. In 11% of patients the treatment had to be discontinued wg. adverse reactions. In the VISION study (phase II) for tepotinib, treatment naïve and pre-treated patients with METex14 NSCLC were included, evidence of METex 14 mutation was performed either by tissue biopsy or liquid biopsy (liquid biopsy) [1]. For 275 patients who were partly treatment navid (137) and partly pre-treatment (138), the total ORR was 49.1 % (95% CI 43 – 55.2), the median response duration (mDOR) was 13.8 month – 45.3 - 9.5% CIRR. In previously treated patients, the ORR was 44.2% (95% CI 35.8 – 52.9), the mDOR 11.1 months (95%CI 8.4 – 18.5) [1]. The median PFS (total) was 10.8 months (95%) CI 8.5 – 12.4), the first line 10.4 months (95 CI 8.4 – 15.3) and the previous patients 11.0 months (955 CI 8.2 – 12). [1] Out of 15 patients with CNS metastases (evaluated using RANO-BM criteria), 13 patients (87%) achieved intracranial disease control [1210]. Out of 7 patients with measurable target lesions, 5 patients (71%) showed response, and 3 patients with target lesions completely disappeared [1211]. Treatment was relatively well tolerated, the most frequent treatment-related adverse reactions were peripheral oedema in 60.1% of patients (100.0% grade 3.4) and nausea (22.7% of patients) and diarrhoea (21.3% of patients), both of them were commonly considered to be of grade 1.2. In the first class of treatment, the treatment had to be permanently considered in terms of the efficacy of the treatment.",

[1211) Phase III study on Sotorasib 2nd line [1213] In this phase III study, 375 patients with a CRAS G12C following prior therapy of a combination therapy with an i2.5 month. Primary endpoint was the OS by independent evaluation, secondary endpoints, response rate, duration of response, disease control rate, and quality of life. The study was originally powered for the OS, but for ethical reasons, cross-over from the control arm to sotorasib was allowed, so that the primary endpoint to PFS was changed and the number of patients included was reduced. Out of 171 patients randomized for sotorasib, 169 received therapy, out of 174 patients randomised for docetaxel, only 151 received docexaxel therapy. Patient characteristics were balanced, median age was 64 years. The primary endpoint PFS has been statistically significantly achieved with an HR of 0.66 (p=0.002), the median difference of PFS being 1.1 months most frequented by sotor asib. Subgroup analyses showed no differences with respect to different benefit levels with regard to the primary outcome PFS. Response was significantly better with 80.4 vs. 62.8%, the ORR was significantly improved with respect of depth of 28b2.5 vs. The median duration of response was also better with 8.6 months vs. 6.8 months in favour of sotorasib. A survival benefit could not be shown, probably due to the cross-over to a KRAS inhibitor in the control arm (34% of the control arms). Despite pre-treatment of all patients with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, the number of treatment-dependent AEs > Grade 3 after WHO was significantly lower with sotorasib (10.7%) vs. docetaxel (22.5%). The clinically relevant parameter of discontinuation of therapies was at 9.5 vs. 11.3, dose reductions with 15.4 vs. 26.5 in favor of soorasib, only dose pauses were distributed with 35.5 vs. 15.2 in favourof chemotherapy. The most common treatment-related AE among sotorasiasib were diarrhoea and increased liver enzymes, the most common among 8.6 Stadi ECium IV V (without indication of definitive local therapy) 334 docetaxel granulocyteia, fatality and abnormality were seen in the sotoraside. Improvement in ‘global health status, physical functioning' and breathlessness was seen with sotorasib, no differences were observed with regard to the leading symptoms of coughing. The time to the deterioration of the ‘global Health status', the ‘physical functioning', air distress and coughing were seen, there was no difference for the endpoint chest pain. This study demonstrates the advantage of a second-line therapy in KRAS G12C mutated patients with lung carcinoma compared to the standard docetaxel, so that this therapy should be the prefered standard in chemotherapy and immunotherapy therapy. Other CRAS inhibitors are in the clinical trial with less pronounced NW profile, which could possibly replace sotorasib in the future. Therapy with other driver mutations in the NSCLC In addition to the previously treated alterations, there are other targeted driver mutations in NSClc. However, the evidence here is not sufficient to show recommendations for early line treatment at the latest. For these mutations, the status should be determined at the latest in case of failure of standard therapy (immunotherapy or immunochemotherapy). In the case of an activating mutation in these genes, an attempt should be made to enable the patient to achieve targeted therapy, e.g. in clinical trials or by off-label treatment. Consensus-based recommendation tested 2024 In view of the dynamics of the development of new personalized therapeutic approaches, it should be sought that each patient with NSCLC stage IV receives a comprehensive NGS-based molecular diagnosis prior to the initial line therapy decision. In patients with wild type configuration for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF V600 , NTRK, RET, METex14, comprehensive genotyping should take place on other known driver mutations in order to detect such a targeted therapy within the scope of authorisation (if necessary for further mutations with approved drugs), a study or in off- label use. This analysis should include in particular KRAS mutations and HER2 (ERBB2) mutations as well as MET amplifications. There is a strong consensus that in patients with non-platene epithelial carcinoma histology and wild-type configuration of EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF V600, NTRK1-3, RET, METex14 at the latest in recurrence after platinum-based chemotherapy, a test for all known therapy-relevant driver mutations is recommended. This concerns in particular KRAS mutations (especially KRASA G12C), HER2 (ERBB2) Exon 20 insertion mutations(HER2 (ERSBB2) ex20), MET amplifications as well as FGFR mutations and fusions. For this purpose, an individual response to such a response should not be considered. In case of an inhibitor, the patient should be considered as an individual respondent. If this is not possible and an off-label medication is available, such a procedure should be considered individually and compared with the chances of responding to a therapy with an immunocheckpoint inhibitor. In relation to the molecular pathological studies performed, external quality assurance should be demonstrated in the context of ring trials, if appropriate ring trials are available. Diagnostics and therapy of oligometastased non-small cell lung carcinoma Consensus-based recommendation tested 2024 The stage of oligometastasis is characterized by a limited metastasis, in which a local ablative therapy of all tumour flocks in addition to system therapy pursues a curative therapy goal. A limited number of metastases in imaging is used as a surrogate for a limited metabolism capacity. Definitions of oligametastasated NSCLC vary between a solitary remote metastasase according to stage M1b after UICC classification (8th Ed) and a maximum of 3-5 remote metastatics as inclusion criteria of prospective studies. based on patients with a maximum of two remote metastases, which should form the basis for the indication of a local ablative therapy in combination with an adequate system therapy of the oligometastase NSCLC. Consensus based recommendation tested 2024 A synchronous oligometastasis of the NSCLS is defined by the simultaneous diagnosis of the locoregional primary tumor as well as oligo metastasis, while in metachronic oligometastase an interval of at least 6 months lies between the primary diagnosis of a non-remote metastasised NSClc with curative intended therapy and the occurrence of oligone metastalysis.

Introduction In the metastatic stage the non-small cell lung carcinoma has a poor prognosis. The backbone of the treatment is palliative system therapy, possibly supplemented by palliatory radiation therapy; palliating operations are rare. For the first time Hellmann and Weichselbaum described that a potentially curative treatment approach for this patient group exists with the eradication of metastases. Definition A uniform definition of the OMD with the necessary diagnostic criteria is required to identify patients for a locally radical intensified treatment. In the 8th edition of the TNM classification, the M-descriptor differentiated for the firsttime between M1b (a single metastasis in one organ) and M1c (multiple metastasy in one or more organs). While no long-term survival >5 years could be observed in stage M1C, a plateau appears to exist in stage m1b with approximately 10% long-lasting survival after 5 years. As there was no international consensus so far, the existing study situation is heterogeneous [1215]. Most of the prospective clinical studies for OMD patients with 3-5 metastas have been approved as inclusion criteria, but in fact in these studies the majority of patients with only median 1-2 metastatic patients were included. The published prospective studies are grouped into a table. [12] Also, the pre-diagnosis did not occur.",

      "text": "MRI of the skull was performed. In 2019, EORTC first described a definition and diagnostic criteria for synchronous oligometastase non-small cell lung carcinoma (sOM-NSCLC) in a previously broad consensus process (2017-2018). [1217] A sOM-NSCLC is available if radical therapy of all tumour manifestation stations is technically and functionally possible with acceptable toxicity and this is associated with the goal of long-term tumor control. A maximum of 5 metastases in 3 organs are defined as oligometastases disease, although a treatment advantage in the oligometastase concept for patients with more than two metastasis cannot be proven by the absence of appropriate studies. Nevertheless, the comprehensive definition is considered to be extended metastas to up to 5 metastatics in up to three organizations, both in terms of future study planning and in potentially curative radiation therapy options in patients with up to four brain metastasizes. The diffuse infestation with serous metastases (meninges, pericardium, pleura, mesenteries) and bone marrow is not considered sOM-NSCLC. In the case of solitary pleural metastasis, thoracoscopy/videothoracoscopy should be performed to exclude diffuse pleural metabolism. Patients with a malignant pleural effusion are also excluded from a potentially curative oligometastasis treatment concept. [1217] Ipsilateral synchronous pulmonary metastasies are to be considered as organ localization and are also identified as contralateral lung metastaas in the 8th edition of the TNM classification. Simultaneous tumours of the lungs should be histopathologically and possibly using molecular-genetic methods as lung metastatics or secondary carcinomas.

In this context, the recurrence event occurring in the course of oncological follow-up, after primary curative treatment of lung cancer, is described as \"oligocurrence\" [1225]. The general concept of metachronous oligometastasis is rather descriptive and describes the limited metastasation of number (<5) and organ localizations during the disease course, usually defined with an interval of >6 months after primary diagnosis. The metachhronous metastasy is independent of the oncologic status of the primary tumor: curatively treated and controlled or still present/tumorprogress. The occurrence of limited number and number of Metastases can be defined in this context if the primary lung carcinoma appears curative and controlled without local recurrence, the local curative/ablative therapy of the metastames is described in the following. This defines the subsequent state after system therapeutic eradication of existing metastases from a polymetastasated tumor disease towards an oligometastasis present with few remaining metastasis. In this situation, the possibility of consolidating local therapy of remaining metastatic localizations in the tumor board is to be decided. For patients with progression of single metastamas under system therapy, the term oligoprogression has been coined. Here, these metastas can be treated by means of a local ablative therapy, provided that the further metastaSIS remains controlled/stable under system treatment.

In order to assess a solitary liver metastasis, an MRT of the liver and in case of possible isolated pleura metastases, thoracoscopy with biopsy is recommended. The pathological protection of metastas found in the 18F FDG-PET/CT is generally recommended, but is based on therapeutical aspects and benefit-risk ratio, which should be evaluated in an interdisciplinary team. [1217] Therapy The goal of therapy is long-term tumor control. To achieve this, it is necessary to treat all tumour manifestations locally radically with simultaneous systemic tumour control. Thus, multimodal treatment is indicated. Different methods of local-abradication therapy are not used as a method of topical therapy (the incidence of Evidor) are also used in other studies. Other local therapeutic procedures are not prospectively investigated and should therefore not be used outside of studies.

The efficacy of systemic treatment followed by local consolidation versus systemic treatment alone in (synchronous or metachronic) oligometastase NSCLC [1213]. Patients with a maximum of three oligometastases after first-line system therapy were included. Body stereotaxia was the most commonly used local therapy modality. This study was discontinued following the randomisation of 49 patients by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee. After a mean follow-up period of 38.8 months, the mean progression-free survival in patients with additional locally consolidation therapy was 14.2 months compared to 4.4 months with system alone. A second randomised phase II study included NSClc patients with a maximal of 5 oligonetases (additional to the local survival regimen) who were significantly improved by local consolidating therapy from 17.0 to 41.2 months. The study showed a significantly improved progression-free survival of median 9.7 months vs. 3.5 months (p=0.01). This study was also prematurely discontinued due to the large PFS benefit in the experimental arm after randomisation and evaluation of only 29 patients. Palma et al.'s randomized Phase II study investigated the influence of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy in addition to palliative chemotherapy compared to sole palliatory systemic treatment; primary endpoint of overall survival [1223]. Including metachronoligometastasised patients (n=99; maximum 5 metastases in controlled primary tumor) independent of primary tumour histology; 18/99 patients had bronchial carcinoma. Overall survival was 28 months in the control group versus 41 months in SBRT group (p = 0.09); progression- free survival was significantly improved with HR=0.47 (p0.0012). Radiotactical exposure of oligometastases of various organ systems Stereotactic radiation is superior to conventional fractional radiotherapy of several weeks of local effectiveness. While a randomised comparison with oligometastases is lacking, normofractive radiotherapy was compared with SBRT in the localised inoperable lung carcinoma at stage I: according to SBRI, a significant reduction in local tumour recurrence rate (HR 0.32; p=0.008) was observed without increased adverse reactions resulting in an improved overall survival (HR=0.53; p =0.027) [563]. With limited brain metastasis, radiosurgery achieves improved survival compared to the single whole brain radiation [1227]: the RTOG 9508 study randomized 333 patients with a maximum of 3 brain metastatics to single brain radiation versus whole brain irradiation and additionally radiosurgical: in the multivariate analysis, radio surgery improves overall survival in the subgroups of patients with RPA class I (with a significant increase in Hkransiology) and significantly increased in radiotherapy. However, after radiosurgery alone, there is a significant increase in intracranial progression, which requires close-meshed cranial MRI follow-up every 2-3 months. A retrospective multi-centre analysis based on 24 centers and 301 patients investigated SBRT for the treatment of pulmonary oligometastases of the NSCLC [1231]: the 2-year overall survival was 62% with a 2-year local tumor control of 82%. A match pair analysis of 110 patients with resection (n=68) or SBRI (n = 42) of pulmonary oligometastases revealed an identical long-term survival after 5 years of 41% (resection) vs. 45% (SBRT) with identical local metastasis control of 81 % vs. 83% [1232]. A retro-spective study of the group stereotactic radiotherapy of the German Society of Radiooncology (DEGRO) evaluated 637 patients who had been treated with pulmonary oligometastasis by means of SBrit. 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) 345 For the treatment of adrenal metastases, a systematic survey summarises the predominantly retrospective data [1234]. By 2014, 178 patients were treated with SBRT in adrenal metastatics, of which 68% had NSCLC histology. The 2-year local control was 63% in the weighted mean, the 2-year overall survival 19%. The authors discuss the results from the point of view that the patients were predominantly classified as medically inoperable and thus had a reduced life expectancy and that partly palliative and non-radical SBRI radiation doses had been used. The largest retrospective analysis investigated 43 patients (n=36 NSClc) with 49 adrenal metaastases, which had been treated stereotactically at a single centre from 2009 to 2015 [1235]. The 2 year local tumor control was in the overall collective 57% and 100% in the subgroup of patients treated with a radiation dose of >100Gy BED overall survival. Center analysis of the German Society for Radiooncology, working group Radiosurgery and Stereotaxia, based on 474 patients treated with 623 lesions [1236]; 29 patients had NSCLC histology. Acute or chronic Grade III toxicity was observed in 1% and 1.4% of patients respectively. Local metastasis control at 3 years was 55.7%, the 3-year overall survival was 29%. A prospective study in 220 patients who were stereotactically irradiated in primary or secondary liver tumours showed no reduction in quality of life as a result of high-dose stereotastic radiotherapy [1237]. Based on an analysis of SEER's database, the presence of a single ossaric metastasation was associated with a beneficial prognosis of metastatic NSClc [1238]. In a prospective multi-institutional phase II study (n=57 patients; 20% NSCL) following SBRT of painful metastases of the spine (57% oligometastas) was reported in local tumour control of 83.9%; in a clinical period of 1 year. In a prospective phase II study (n=40), prospective studies on local radiotherapy of oligometastase NSCLC single-armed studies De Ruyscher et al. investigated radical radiotherapy in patients with synchronous oligomatase N SCLC [1214]. Approximately 3⁄4 of patients suffered from a locoregionally advanced disease in stage IIIA and IIIB and over 85% of patients had solitary oligometastasis. In this study, a median overall survival of 13.5 months and a median progression-free survival of 12.1 months were observed. In the long-term analysis after a minimum of 7 years follow-up, only 2.5% of patients remained disease-free [1215]. Collen et al was studied in a single- armed phase II treatment regimen, either as an indication of either the response of the primary metabolite, or as a maximum dose of 5 minutes. Radiotherapy was followed either by 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication of definitive local therapy) or by 446 induction chemotherapy (n=17) or primarily by 9. Following a median follow-up period of 16.4 months, FDG-PET-based complete tumour response was observed in 30% of patients with median PFS and overall survival of 11.2 months and 23 months respectively. Petty et al. studied consolidation radiotherapy in a single-arm phase II study in patients with oligometastase NSCLC (maximum 5 metastases, maximum 3 extracerebral) [1219]. After 3-6 months of platinum-containing chemotherapy without subsequent progression (n = 27/29), radiotherapy was performed either in stereotactic or conventional fractionation. Median PFS with overall survival was 11.2 and 28.4 months respectively; Arrieta et al, in a prospective one-armed phase II trial, was followed by radical consolidation of local non-therapy (locally administered). Following local therapy, 51% of patients achieved CR in FDG-PET, resulting in a median PFS of 23.5 months. Bauml et al. conducted a single-arm prospective phase II study in n=51 patients with oligometastase NSCLC with pembrolizumab after completed local ablative therapy. In 46/51 patients radiotherapy was used as a single local ablative therapy or in combination with surgery. Following a median follow-up period of 25 months, the median PFCS was 19.1 months, significantly longer than in historical comparison. Overall survival was 77.5% after 2 years. Randomized studies In a randomised phase II trial, Gomez et al was compared to the efficacy of systemic treatment followed by local consolidation therapy versus systemic treatment alone in (synchronous or metachronic) oligoma-based NSCLS [1213]. Patients with a maximum of three oligometastases following initial line system therapy were included. Following a mean follow-up time of 38.8 months, mean progression-free survival in patients with additional locally consolidating therapy was 14.2 months compared to 4.4 months with system alone. Also, the mean time to develop new metastases was increased from 6.0 months to 14.2 month, while the adverse results were comparable in both groups. Overall survival was significantly improved by local consolidation therapy from 17.0 to 41.2 months. A second, randomised Phase II study concluded NSCLC patients with a maximum of 5 oligometastases (in addition to the probably progressive primary tumour) after initial lines chemotherapy [816]. As a local ablative method, only SBRT was allowed. The study showed a significantly improved progression- free survival of median 9.7 months vs. 3.5 months (p=0.01). Also this study was discontinued due to the large PFS benefit in the experimental arm following randomisation and evaluation of only 29 patients. 6 Stadi ium IV V (without indication of definitive local therapy) was additionally studied by the radiotherapy group for 3 weeks. Al. investigated the influence of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy in addition to palliative chemotherapy compared to sole palliativ systemic treatment; primary endpoint leading to overall survival [1223]. Included were metachronoligometastatic patients (n=99; maximum 5 metastases in controlled primary tumor) independent of the histology of the primary tumor; 18/99 patients had bronchial carcinoma. Overall survival was 28 months in the control group versus 41 months in SBRT group (p=0.09); progression-free survival was significantly improved with HR=0.47 (p = 0.0012). Operation in OMD Basically, in the metastatic tumor stage of NSCLC, the indication for system therapy is present, both in primary diagnosis and in metastatic recurrence situations. However, derived from experience there, Oligoma metastasis is also shown in the local ablative therapy for surgery, radiotherapy or radiofrequency absorption, which is not recommended for combination therapy. However, if combination treatment is refused or not possible by the patient, there is still an indication of local treatment for oligometastasis. Regarding the equivalence of procedures surgery and radiotherapy in the treatment of oligometastases, Mordant was unable to demonstrate a treatment advantage of metastasis in a historical group of 94 patients [1241]. Selecting the appropriate local procedure should be decided in the thoracic oncological tumor board, based on the localisation of metastatics, surgical reectability, the need for histological protection and the general condition of the patient. In a metaanalysis of retrospective data from 757 patients with predominantly surgical resection of oligometastases (62.3%), Ashworth et al. had a significant treatment advantage for patients with metachronous occurrence (5-year survival: 47.8%) versus patients with synchronous metastases (5-JÜL: 36.2%) or a synchronised metastasation and N1/N2 lymph nodes, respectively, the primary NSC frequency is found in the absence of the following surgery. In addition to the surgical resection of lung metastases, the resections of adrenal metastasis are the most frequently performed locally ablative therapies of extracranial metastasy localizations. Although the incidence of isolated adrenal metastatics in historical collectives is reported to be 1.6%-3.5% [1242], for patients with adrenal enlargement and malignancies with a probability of 50-75% [1233], histological protection should be sought. In the comprehensive retrospective metaanalysis, Tanvetyanon T et al. [1244] over 114 patients from 1986-2006 were able to demonstrate a more favourable median overall survival for patients who had metachronic metastasation (12 vs. 31 months). In a further comprehensive retrospective analysis of 59 patients with secondary metastatic reactions after PET and MRT Staging, the median survival time was 77 months (5-year overall survival: 59%) and the median survival rate was found to be significant. The recurrence-free median survival was 15 months and the 5-year recurrence- free survival was 30.3% [1245]. In comparison with the access routes to the resection of adrenal metastases, 348 open adrenalectomy, laparoscopic and robot-assisted procedures are used in addition to the 6 Stadiium IV V (without indication for definitive local therapy) [1246]. Studies on the surgical treatment of extra-cranial, extra-adrenal metastasis localizations are only reported in small case series. The performed metaanalysis of Salah S et al [1247] was able to identify 51 work with 62 patients between 1980 and 2011. Metastases localisations were bone, liver, kidney and spleen metastases with a 5-year overall survival of 50%. As clinically relevant and statistically significant predictive, the N status of primary lung carcinoma (N0/1 versus N2/3) were observed after local therapy of liver metastasy. Work with 32 patients in an oligometastasis of the pancreas was shown by DeLuzio MR et al. [1248] a 5-year survival of 21% after curative resection. For patients with further pulmonary tumour detection synchronous or metachronically detected after curatory therapy, the question remains to what extent this is a pulmonary second carcinoma or lung metastasis from Primorius. Biopsy should be targeted here and histological, immunohistochemical and molecular biological comparative analysis with the primary tumor should be performed. Treatment of primary lung carcinomas should be curative here, according to treatment without oligometastasation. Following local ablative treatment of 176 patients with pulmonary and extrapulmonary monometastatic therapy, a significant benefit in long-term survival was achieved in patients with pulmonary metastases of a year such as 27.1% [1249]. In contrast, in a different lung lobe, a 5-year overall survival with synchronous occurrence of 30.7% and in metachronic metastasis with 34.8% was observed [1250]. Treatment of solitary ossaric metastases in the oligometastasis concept has not been able to confirm the favourable results in retrospective studies of other localizations to the same extent. [1251]. [1252].[1241] Nevertheless, the randomised SABR-COMET study with a proportion of 31% and 35% of patients with bone metastasy confirmed a significantly more favourable progression-free survival of 12 months in the stereotactically treated overall group compared to 6 months without locally ablative therapy [1223]. In principle, frequent surgical treatment induction represents the necessary back-mark depression in the case of spinal metastasation. System therapy in OMD The principles of system therapy (choice of substances, concepts with or without maintenance therapy, combination of chemotherapy regimens with immune inhibitors NSC) have not been used in the treatment of OMD.

The incidence is rather slight. The proportion of small lung carcinoma in the USA was 17% in 1973 and 13 [1253] in 2003. The mean survival time of untreated diseases is extremely unfavourable and is less than 3 months. The disease has a high therapeutic sensitivity. By using appropriate treatment strategies k the mean survival period for remote metastasis is increased to 8-12 months and limited disease to 14-20 months. While in the case of remote metastatic disease a long-term survival over 5 years is observed only in extremely rare isolated cases (<1%), in retrospective analyses the recidivfr five-year survival rate for limited disease between 30% and 50% lieg At least in the absence of haematogenic distant metastasation, the disease is potentially curatively treated. Strong Consensus See chapter 6.5 Evidence-based statement reviewed 2024 nce Due to a particular prognostic significance of SCLC, ECOG Performance Status, Gender and LDH should be collected. Consensual background The main predictive parameters are the spread of the tumour disease. llig ne can egen enen reie. g n 2 Progn nosep parameter 353 Tumor spread should generally be classified according to TNM and therapy recommendations should be prepared on the ground of the TN M system. The TNNM staging system allows a uniform definition of tumour spread for all lung cancers. However, it should be noted that this system was primarily developed and validated for non-small cell lung cancer. For the small cell carcinoma, apart from a few operational treatment series, there are no prospective studies performed and analysed on the basis of the tNM system. Almost all previously published data are based on the VALG (Veterans Administration Lung Cancer Group) subdivision in limited and extensive treatment groups, however, which are not based on a single class of disease. For conservative non-operational treatment approaches, therefore, only study results for the overall group Limited and not for the individual UICC stages are available. The following therapy recommendations are therefore usually based on the stages of VALG. \"Limited disease\" (LD) On the initial hemithorax of limited tumours with or without ipsi- or contralateral mediastinal or ipsilateral supraclavikular lymph node metastases* and with or Without ipsiilateral pleural effusion regardless of cytological result*. \"Extensive disease\"(ED) Any spread beyond limited disease \"Ipsi-lateral and/or contralateral supraklavikular Lymph node metases and cytologically malignant pleuraer efficiencies are also counted by some groups as extensive disease %. A very limited stage with lung-limited primary tumor and without mediastental lymph nodes (sog. Exy-4. Very malign pleura efaction) is diagnosed in the phase NIC. - 35 % are diagnosed at stage extensive (according to UICC T3-4 N0-1 and T1-4N2-3M0) and 60 % - 70 % in stage extensive(according to uICC M1). In addition to the tumour spread, the patient characteristics according to ECOG performance status and gender are prognostically relevant [1256], [1257],[1258],.[1259], [...]1260], and [1261]. Women have a more favourable prognosis in all subgroups [1262], ...1263]. Age per se is not a negative prognosive parameter until at least 75 years of age, however, significant for therapeutic decisions and thus also prognosticly relevant is the presence of comorbidities whose incidence and manifestation is age-dependent [1264]. The main laboratory parameter with prognostic significance is the LDH. The prognoses are steadily deteriorating with an increase in LD H value.",

Patients and stadia-dependent should be combined with local measures, e.g. surgery or radiation therapy. nce Strong consensus Central therapy measure in all stages of SCLC is the implementation of a combination chemotherapy. This is supplemented by local therapy measures dependent on stadia. Functionally operable patients in stage I-II should be subjected to multimodal therapy including surgery. In case of inoperability, irradiation should be carried out as local therapy in the absence of remote metastasis and irramidable tumour spread. In all stages, prophylactic cranial radiation in appealing patients decreases the intracerebral recurrence rate and can prolong survival. General recommendations for the implementation of chemotherapy The administration of chemotherapy should be initiated immediately after diagnosis, avoiding waiting for symptomatic progress [1267]. The following substances have demonstrated activity in small cell lung carcinoma: cisplatin, carboplatin, etoposide, teniposide, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, vincristine, methotrexate, Adriamycin, epirubicin, paclitaxel, irinotecan, topotecan, bendamustine.

In patients with metastatic disease who do not receive complementary immunotherapy, 6 cycles should be used. Longer durations of therapy prolong progression-free survival, but overall survival is not affected or at most marginally [1278], [1279] (Evidence level 1b). Treatment in stageT1-2N01M0(VLD). In stage T1-2N0-M0, either multimodal therapy can be performed including surgery or combined chemo-ray therapy. The patient's coorbidities and functional operability are decisive for the choice of treatment modalities. The patient's comorbidities and functional operability are crucial for the choice of treatment modalities. Evidence-based recommendation tested 2024 degrees In patients with SCLC at stage I/II without mediastinal lymph node infestation, multimodal therapy should be performed as a combination of local treatment (operation or, in particular, at high surgical risk, radiotherapy) with systemic chemotherapy. nce [1255], [1280],[1281],.[1282], [...]1284], <1285],<1286],>1287] Strong consensus In an evidence report (02/2021, see guidance documents), evidence of two local therapy measures (operation and radiation therapy) was sought in addition to system therapy in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in stage I and II was summarised in a systematic survey, metaanalysis, randomized studies, and cohort studies with adequate confounderadisation, which included at least 50 patients and were published after 2010 on the basis of these treatment options. These studies contain results from confounded analyses and based on a propensity matching which reduce the risk of selection bias in the selection of therapy. Adjustment is based on information stored in the databases, so that the patient's general condition and individual comorbidities could not be fully taken into account in any of the studies. For this reason, additional results from three cohort studies and a systematic overview of the comparison of therapy with and without surgery and results from two cohort studies were extracted to compare therapy with or without radiation therapy.

In patients with lymph nodes and with T3 tumours, there was an additional dose of therapy that can be confirmed without the possibility of treatment. The comparison of patients treated with and without radiotherapy confirms the efficacy of radiotherapy treatment (evidence level 2b-). Comparative results on the occurrence of relapses and serious adverse reactions after surgery or radiotherapy have not been reported in any of the included studies. Operative therapy option Evidence-based recommendation tested 2024 degrees In patients with SCLC in stage I/II without mediastinal lymph node infestation, a primary operation can be performed. However, since the importance of the operation is not secured by prospective studies, pneumonectomy and non-anatomical resections should be avoided. In addition, a mediastental lymph node infection should be prevented preoperatively by staging involving FDG-PET/CT and possibly EBUS and mediastinoscopy. nce [1288], [1289],[1290], ] [1292], <1255], > [1280],<1282],> [1283] is an inconsensitivity cell. In Phase II studies with primary surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy [1288], [1289],[1290] patients with pathologically secured stage I (N0 situation) achieved 3-year survival rates of 50-70% (evidence level 2b), corresponding to non-small cell lung carcinoma. If a stage II with an N1 situation is present, the 3 year survival rates are 30-40%. In the case of pre-operatively proven mediastinal lymph node infestation (N2), the 3-year lifetime rates are only 20%. Randomised controlled studies of primary surgery, and adjunct chemotherapy of small cell lung cancer are not available. In 90 years of the past century, it was generally considered that surgery in the treatment of small-cell lung cancer can only play a role in the very early stages (T1-2. In the stage T1-2N0-1M0 (VLD) 357, a randomised study of Lad et al in 1994, where there was no clear treatment advantage for surgery, is essentially based on a randomized study conducted in 1994, but the more detailed analysis of this study shows that only very few patients were included here and that 2/3 of the cases are highly advanced tumours. 20% of the patients received only a sample thoracotomy. The surgical procedures were unclear, so that definitive conclusions can not be drawn from this study. A series of retrospective and prospensity-match-score analyses were published below which indicate that local therapeutic procedures, in particular the resection in the stages I-IIIA, can play an important role in ensuring long-term survival of patients with small cell lung carcinomas [1255], [1280],[1282]. These retrospective work are summarized in a recent metaanalysis [1256], and it is clear that there is also a significant increase in the overall outcome of the stage I as well as in the existing outcome of a stage I. The study from China [1255], [1283] shows that, as with non-small cell lung carcinoma, anatomical resection in terms of lobectomy ensures the best survival benefit. This confirms once again that local therapeutic measures are important in early forms of small cell lung cancer. A survival benefit in stage I can also be demonstrated in patients older than 75 years [1284]. Further retrospective studies indicate that both adjuvant mediastinal radiation, and especially patients in tumour stage I, may be beneficial for survival [1295],[1285]. A large register study in patients with SCLC in stage cT1-2N0M0 compares surgery with chemotherapy to combined radiation chemotherapy in 1002 patients. The operated group shows a 5-year survival of 49.2% compared to 32.5% in the radiation group. [1286] It is important to mention that in a part of patients with small cell tumor (ca. 5. For contraindications against cisplatin, the use of alternative protocols should be offered. Strong consensus 9.4 Beha EK EK andlun ng in stage T1-2N0-1M0 (VLD) 358 Background Postoperatively, adjuvant chemotherapy should be included. Older studies with sole surgery could in almost no case achieve a long-term survival [1291], first the introduction of additional chemotherapy significantly improved the prognosis [1288], [1289],[1290]. In a study of Brock et al 2005 the five-year survival rate for patients with flat-content therapy was 68% compared to only 32% in non-platform therapy. Further predictive parameters for better five-month survival were complete lobectomy vs. limited resection (50 vs. 20 %) and women versus men (60 vs. I. radiotherapy) were frequently used in post-stage therapy. A commonly used approach provides for the administration of 30 Gy in 15 fractions or 25 Gy in 10 fractions. Strong Consensus Consensual Recommendation reviewed 2024 When a resection has been performed in a patient with SCLC in stage I/II, an individual decision on mediastinal irradiation is to be made in case of N1 infestation depending on lymph node localisation and surgical evaluation of radicality. Strong consensus Consensive Recommendation tested 2024 If a reection has been carried out in a patients with SCLS in preoperative stage I / II, a mediastental irratiation should be performed in N2 infestations. This recommendation should be evaluated in a dose of 50-60 Gy in conventional fractionation.

The therapeutic recommendations are based on the above-mentioned Phase II studies with primary surgery [1288], [1289], and [1290] in which the indications for radiotherapy measures were submitted in a corresponding manner. In addition, the basic effectiveness of both prophylactic cranial irradiation and primary tumor and mediastinal radiation at the stage limited disease is included in the recommendation. Procedure for round herd with preoperatively unsecured small cell lung carcinoma In the case of detectable peripheral round herod without other tumor manifestations detectable in the imaging procedures, a primary resection of the round herder can be performed first for histology recovery and then for decision on the further therapeutic procedure. If the rapid-section examination in such a case shows a small cell pulmonary carcinomas, then an anatomical resection (in the rule of lobectomy) with ipsilateral systematic lymphadenectomy should be carried out. In the case of a nodal positive disease or a R1/R2 situation, mediastinal irradiation of 50 to 60 Gy should be performed in parallel with cranial radiation. If only the atypical resection of the peripheral round herd is achieved without subsequent anatomical resection with lymphadenectomy, these patients are considered to be oncologically inappropriate surgery. In this case, further treatment is to be performed analogous to clinical stage T3-4 or N2-3 in the form of combined chemo-ray therapy (see Chapter 5).

Prophylactic cranial irragation is to take place in all patients. Atypical resection of a pulmonary herd with subsequent detection of small cell lung carcinoma results in identical therapeutic procedures. In patients with no surgery, primary combined chemotherapy is available. This is analogous to the procedure in patients with further advanced but locally limited disease.

Carboplatin-containing protocols are insufficiently evaluated and should only be used in the case of clear contraindications against cisplatin. nce [1298], [1299],[1300], (1301], (‘1302'), [1303], ‘1304', [1305], '1306', ‘ 1308', ' 1309', and ‘1310', Strong Consensus Background The first-choice combination of chemotherapy represents cispidine/ etoposide (PE). Metaanalysis of randomised studies comparing cisplan and/or etoposide-containing regimens versus cisptan and/ or etopose-free regimens show significant survival benefits for the inclusion of cispanta and/opose (PE) in the course of a day. When administering PE, care should be taken to ensure that etoposide administration is performed after cisplatin and administered for at least 3 days [1300]. An advantage of cispabine and/or etoposide-containing regimens compared to other regimens has been shown in a variety of studies that are subsequently described briefly. In the Scandinavian study of Sundström et al. 2002 [1301], 214 patients were seen to have superiority over CEV (cyclophosphamide/epirubicin/vincristin). In the LD group, median survival times (14.5 vs. 9.7 months) and 3-year survival (25% vs. 8%) were highly significantly favourable in the PE arm. In ED, there were no efficacy differences. The study of Thatcher et al 2005 [1302] had the carboplatin-containing ICE plus vincristine-free treatment, and in this case, significant 5 behaed andluning of the tumour stables T3-4 had been achieved with an increase in the incidence of 3 here/or N/ograde. In the study of Einhorn et al. 1988 [1303], the additional administration of PE in patients with response to 6 cycles of ACO led to an improvement in prognosis (evidence level 1b). Also in two German studies, a cisplatin-containing therapy of a platinum-free strategy was superior to Wolf et al, 1987 [1304], Havemann et al; 1987 [1274]. An increase in efficacy by adding etoposid was also seen in a study of Jackson et al 1984 [1305]. In the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) [1306] study, the addition of etoposide to the ACO regimen in LD patients resulted in an improvement of prognoses. This ACO-E regimen was tested in a SWOG study [1307] against the alteration of ACo and PE, whereby a small prolongation of the median survival time (16.5 vs 15.1 mo-life-survival rate for ACO/PE was not demonstrated. ACO and PE was compared directly with the benefit of about 12. There was an advantage of the alternating arm over both individual protocols (median TZ 16.8 vs 12.4 vs 11.7 months). (Evidence level 1b) These results suggest that additional administration of etoposide or cisplatin/ etoposide can improve the prognosis of the only ACO-treated patients in the stage limited disease. Whether carboplatin is equivalent to cispabine is not proven to be safe. In a German study [1276], response rates and survival times for cisplan were more favourable than for carbolatin (evidence level 2b), a Greek [1309] and a Scandinavian study [1310] could not detect any differences, with no adequate differentiation in LD and ED patients being performed (Evience level 2B). Also, the study of deer et al. 2001 [1311] showed increased efficacy when cisptan was added to chemotherapy with carboplate, tenipide and vincristine (Evidence grade 1b). The use of chemboplatin-containing protocols should only be used in case of doubtless contraindications against cisplatin. PE should be administered at least over 4 cycles at 3-week intervals. If a continuation of therapy is expected to result in a further benefit for the patient, therapy can be extended to 6 cycles. Anthracycline-containing regimens are burdened with significantly higher toxicity compared to cisplain-containing protocol using simultaneous chemoray therapy.

In particular, cisplatin etoposide after a cycle of combined chemo-radiation therapy with cisplin etoposide and found no difference between the two combinations in the endpoint of overall survival [1321].

Simultaneous vs. consecutive chemo radiation therapy Evidence- based recommendation assessed 2024 degrees The application of radiation therapy to SCLC in tumour stagesT3-4 N0-1 and T1-4N2-3M0 (limitated disease) should be performed simultaneously for chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide. nce [1330], [1332] Strong Consensus Background In a phase II study of SWOG [1331], 154 patients with simulant PE- and radiotherapy were treated with a favourable frequency of 3 years. Previous SWOG studies with consecutive chemo-radiation and have led to the testing of simultaneous therapy for many American groups in the Japan phase III study of [1332]. When PE chemotherapy was administered, hyperfractional radiotherapy was evaluated at the start of the first cycle against an irradiance start after completion of the fourth cycle in 231 patients. Simultaneous administration extended the median survival time from 19.7 to 27.2 months and increased the three- or five-year survival from 20 % to 30 % and 19 % to 24 % respectively. However, this resulted in increased toxicity with leucopenia rates of WHO Grades 3 to 4 from 54% vs. 88% and thrombocytopenia rate from 26% vs. 37%.

The hyperfractional accelerated irradiation of conventionally fractionated radiation therapy with the same total herd dose of 45 Gy was superior, but the biologically effective dose (BED) was lower in conventional fractionation. In another study by Bonner et al. 1999 [1346], [1347] a conventionally refracted radiation therapy was also compared with hyperfractured accelerated radiation therapy, without a significant difference in 5-year survival ( 20 vs. 21%). In the international randomized CONVERT study [1349], a higher dosed conventional radiation (66 Gy/2 Gy) was compared to hyperfractive radiation (45 Gy/2x1.5 Gy) in 547 patients. Interestingly, no significant difference was found in overall survival at the same toxicity in both arms. Therefore, both regimens, i.e. either a hyperfranctive accelerated radiation up to 45 Gy or a conventional fractional exposure to 66 Gy, can currently be compared with a higher biologically active dose ( BED) in the presence of a higher frequency, and a higher rate of survival is not achieved in the absence of a high frequency. The role of a higher BED with and without simultaneous integrated boost is investigated in the CALGB 30610 / RTOG 0538 study (NCT00632853). A Norwegian study [1350] showed the superiority of hyperfractional accelerated RT (45 Gy in 30 fractions, Turrisi) compared to hypofractionated RT (42 Gy in 15 fractions) [1348]. The same group, on the other hand, published a prospectively randomised study on dose escalation (45gy in 30 factions vs. 60 Gy in 40 fractions), of hyperfractioned radio-chemotherapy at the beginning of 2021, whereby the higher dosed study arm was highly significant in terms of overall survival without any significant increased toxicity observed. Thus, higher blood fractional radiation can be considered in patients with good general condition.

Prophylactic cranial radiation Evidence-based recommendation tested 2024 degrees All patients with SCLC stage III with remission after completion of chemo-radiotherapy should be offered prophylactic skull radiation. Preferably, a GHD to 25 Gy should be used in single doses of 2.5 Gy or 30 Gy in single dose doses of 2 Gy daily. nce [1351], [1352],[1353],.[1354] [1355] Consensus background 5 Beha andlun ng of tumour stages T3-4 and/or N2-3, M0 (Limited disease) 368 Two controlled studies of Arriagada et al. 2002 [1356] in a total of 505 patients with LD or ED and complete response after induction showed a reduction in brain metastasis as the first recurrence of 37% in the control group to 20% in the prophylaxis group. The study of Le Péchoux et al. 2009 [1354] investigated 2 different doses of prophylactic cranial irradiation. Here, 720 patients with limited disease and complete remission after induction chemotherapy were included. There was a randomisation to a dose of 25 Gy over 10 fractions or a higher dose of 36 Gy. A total of 157 clinics from 22 countries participated in the study. The rate of brain metastasis was reduced slightly by the higher dose radiation therapy with an incidence of 30% at 25 Gy and 24% at 36 Gy after two years. However, the difference was not statistically significant with a p-value of 0.13. Overall survival showed an advantage for low dose radiation treatment with a two-year survival rate of 42% versus 37% and a p value of 0.03. Amazingly, in the higher dosage group, especially the intrahoracal recurrence rate was increased. This may indicate an unbalancing primary therapy. However the study did not demonstrate an increased efficacy of the dose (evitency remains consistent with the increase in frequency of the patient's exposure). In addition to the significant benefit for all patients confirmed in reducing the incidence of brain metastases, a benefit for the subgroup of non-metastatic patients was also shown in all studies analysed. Technically, the studies cited above are based on homogeneous whole brain radiation. As these may be associated with neurocognitive restrictions in the medium term, hippocampus-saving whole brain irradiation was tested in order to protect neuronal stem cells. In a randomized multicenter study of 150 patients and a follow-up of up to 24 months, a significantly protective neurocoignitive effect (delayed free recall test; DFR) of hippokampus-sparing IMRT was demonstrated without an increased rate of cerebral metastasis [13], therefore, was to be administered as a regimen of a small dose of PCI 57.

The most favourable 5-year survival rates are observed with simultaneous hyperfractional radiotherapy starting with the first chemotherapy cycle with a GDH of 45 Gy, applied in 2x daily ED of 1.5 Gy over 15 days, a dose escalation up to 60 Gy may be associated with a better outcome. An alternative therapy strategy is the simultaneous conventional fractional radio therapy applied in parallel to two PE cycles as early as possible in the course of treatment. Equivalentity of conventionally fractionated radiation with a higher total heart dose compared to hyperfractional accelerated radiation has not been established in a prospective study. The consecutive conduct of chemotherapy and subsequent irradiation is appropriate for patients of older age or at a reduced general condition or the presence of comorbidities (see Chapter 7). ung 24: Treatment of small cell lung carcinoma stage T3-4 and/or N2-3,MO. * Option fractionated accelerated simultaneous chemotherapy) and option B (simultaneous radiation therapy with conventional RT fractionation) are approximately equivalent.

Whether cis or carboplatin should be used was a long topic of discussion. The COCIS metaanalysis [1362], with 663 patients showed no significant difference in median survival (9.6 months with cis, 9.4 months with carbolatin, HR 1.08), progression-free survival (5.5 and 5.3 months) or response rates (67.1% and 66%). Differences were observed in toxicity with more haematotoxicity in patients treated with car boplatin and higher non-haematological, predominantly gastrointestinal toxicity with cisplatin. For the palliative situation, carbo Platin had been found to be comparable to that of chemotherapy. Other chemotherapy combination partners cisplatin, such as irinotecan or topotecan, showed comparable efficacy in studies against etoposide and cispabine0. Due to greater toxicity, they were not approved in Europe [1364], [1365], and the older combinations of cyclophosphamide/vincristine with etoposide or antracyclines (ACO/EpiCO) or the alternating administration of platinum/etoposite and e.g. ACO did not prevail due to higher toxicity and the more difficult combination with ev. irradiation. New standard for good ECOG performance status: chemotherapy in combination with a PD-L1 antibody Two phase III studies, either the PD- L1 antibody atezolizumab or durvalumab in combination of platinum and etoponide alone, showed significant benefits in progression-free and overall survival. In the IMPower 133 study, 403 patients with SCLC and ECOG-PS 0 or 4 placebo-free cycles of attolizone, 0.7 and 1 placebo-exhibition of atlone. 5.2 versus 4.3 months (HR 0.77) and achieved overall survival of 12.3 versus 10.3 months ( HR 0.70) without any significant increase in toxicity [1367]. One-year survival was at 51.7% in the 6 treatment and maintenance of stage M1 (Extensive Disease) 372 atezolizumab group more favourable than 38.2% in the placebo group, at 18 months 34.0% and 21.0% respectively. Newer data are not currently available. Also, 24 months of survival was 22% higher in the atezolizumab group than in the 16.8 % placebo group. [1368] Undesirable effects (AES adverse events) of Grade 3 or higher were seen in 58.1% of patients with atezulizumab and 57.6% among placebo. More severe (Grade 3/4) immune-mediated adverse reactions were seen in 10.6% of patients receiving atezolizumab and 2.6% on placebo. Response rates were similar with the immuno-chemo combination compared to chemotherapy alone (60.2% with atezolizumab vs. 64.4% with placebo). Patients with uncontrolled brain metastases were excluded. However, a small number (n = 35) of patients with previously treated and stable brain metastatics were included. This small group (n=17) did not seem to benefit from the addition of atezolozumab (HR 1.07). For further conclusions, the number of patients observed with brain metastases was too small. In the subgroup of patients who had liver metastasis, a trend was observed in favour of the atezolazumab gabe (HR 0.81). CASPIAN, an open-label phase III study, which also allowed the inclusion of subjects with asymptomatic brain metasases, compared to the combination of cioderomboidal therapy with placebo. In the standard arm, 269 patients received up to 6 cycles of cisor carboplatin plus etoposide. The median overall survival was 12.9 vs. 10.5 months (HR 0.75), thus reducing the risk of death by 25% [1369]. Severe adverse events of all causes (grade 3 or 4) occurred equally frequently in both treatment arms (62%). The incidence of fatal adverse events was also comparable with 5% in the Durvalumab arm and 6% in the standard arms. In the meantime, data with longer follow-up are available: median survival was improved from 10.5 to 12.9 months by combination with durvalumab. In this study, the number of patients with brain metastases in total was 22.9 and 17.6% respectively, compared with 13.9% and 5.8% under chemotherapy alone [1359]. This advantage was demonstrated in all subgroups, including patients with liver or brain metastatics. They had to be asymptomatic or pre-treated or stable. In contrast to the IMPOWER-133 study, they were not treated for more than 90%. The survival benefit under the Durvalumab-Chemo combination was shown regardless of whether Cis- (HR 0, 65) or Carboplatin (HR 0.74) were used 9.6 Beha Table Antikörer Study IMPOV CASPIA and Stage M1 (Extensive Disease) 373 A third study comparison arm in which a four-fold combination of \"double immunotherapy with Durvalubab and Tremelimumab and platinum/Etoposide was given, showed no significant advantage [1369]. Median survival of the quadruple combination was 10.4 months compared to 10.5 months for platinum/eto. (HR 0.82; P=0.0451). The 3 year survival was 15.3%. Mediane progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly higher than 4 months in 4 months of placebo with no higher than 5 months of chemotherapy. The rate of Grade3/4 adverse reactions (AEs) was significantly higher with the quadruple combination. Toxicity-related discontinuations occurred in 21.4% among quadruplicate therapy compared to 10.2% in the Durvalumab+EP group and 9.4% in the EP group. 12 treatment-related deaths occurred under quadruplication therapy, 6 in the Durvalumab +EP group, and 2 with chemotherapy alone. In summary, the cost-benefit observation for Durvalubab plus etoposide/ platinum and the addition of Tremelilumab were reported. [1370] Two studies were available for PD-1 antibody therapy: the (KEYNOTE-604) study compared placebo-controlled 4 cycles of EP with or without the PD-1 inhibitor of pembrolizumab. [ 1371] A significant prolongation of progression-free survival (PFS) of 4.8 vs 4.3 months (HR 0.75). The primary study goal of a significant survival extension (OS) was however not achieved in the placebo group of 10, plus placebo. The study also included only a small number of patients with brain metastases (N=55). Only patients with previously treated brain metastatics and stable findings without further steroid requirements could be included. In this study, similar to the IMPower-133 study, there was no benefit for the addition of immunotherapy in patients with pre-irradiated brain metastases. A smaller phase II study [1372] compared platinum/Eto plus nivolumab or placebo in 160 patients followed by nivolubab maintenance therapy. PFS was significantly longer at 5.5 vs. 4.7 months (HR 0.68) as well as overall survival at 11.3 vs. 8.5 months (PR 0.67). After 12 months, 15% of patients were relapse-free in the chemotherapy combination compared with 5% in the sole chemotherapy arm. e 33: Overview of the chemotherapy studies in combination with PD-1 and PD-L1rper in the M1 stage of treatment.

The first study to test the combination of chemotherapy with ipilimumab in ED-SCLC was negative. The expected survival prolongation (OS) could not be achieved. [1373]. A metaanalysis[1374] summarizes these 5 studies: one phase II (ECOG-ACRIN-5161) and four phase III studies (CASPIAN, IMPOWER-133, KEYNOTE-604 and Reck et al. 2016) with a total of 2775 enrolled patients. 66% were men. 95% were smokers. Mean age was 64 years, ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Compared with chemotherapy alone, the combination with immunotherapy resulted in a significant survival advantage. This was seen among anti-PD-L1 [HR 0.73] and anti-DP-1 [HR 0.66] but not for anti-CTLA-4 [HR 0.90]. Progression-free survival was also beneficial among all immunotherapy therapies without difference between PD-L1, and PD-1-inhibitors was not improved among combination-combination-time. In comparison with chemotherapy alone, the metaanalysis showed no benefit for patients with brain metastases at the time of diagnosis [HR 1.14 p = 0.34]. Otherwise, the survival benefit under the immuno-chemotherapy combination was found in all patient subgroups, regardless of age (<65 or ]65), performance status (0 or 1), the use of carbo- or cisplatin or patients with liver metastasis at the moment of diagnosis. In summary, this metaanalysis revealed an OS and PFS advantage for ED-SCLC patients in the first line of therapy compared to the immuno chemotherapy combination alone. The advantage for anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors was clear. No advantage was shown in anti-CTLA-4 therapy alone or in combination. For maintenance therapy, the large randomised checkmate 451 study [1375] and the incidence rate was significantly higher in 4 cycles of platinum and etoposide. The two-year survival rates were 22%, 21% and 15%. HR for OS comparison was 0.85 for nivolumab monotherapy and 0.92 for combination. Biomarkers:",

Prior to this, a multi-level N2 or N3 infection should be excluded by means of PET-CT, or a cerebral metastasis by way of MRT Skull. If a planned pneumectomie occurs. If, after complete remission, a new pulmonary space requirement occurs, the possibility of a second tumor must also be considered for other histology. In the case of a new round herd with the exclusion of a lymph node infestation or a remote metastases, a secondary resection can be carried out here. In other cases, a second tumour should be considered as a secondary histological disease. In case a complete paralysis of a brain disease should be administered as a follow-up therapy. It is unclear whether subsequent systemic chemotherapy improves the prognosis. In the case of a treatment-free period of more than 6 months, a repetition of first-line therapy is to be considered. If local therapy measures are not possible, the option of second-line chemotherapy is open. Systemic recurrence In patients in ECOG stage 0- 2 and in the disease-related ECOG phase 3, there is an indication of systemic second-lines therapy. It leads to symptom relief and prolongation of survival time. Depending on the time of the new progression, it can be distinguished between a sensitive progression with freedom of treatment of over 90 days and a refractory progression with liberty of therapy of less than 90 days. This distinction has no immediate effect on the choice of second line therapy, however, it is prognostically relevant. Furthermore, one can differentiate between the absence of therapy and a relapserive progression with efficacy of 12 days.

Patients with a reduced general condition (median survival time 20.9 versus 7.7 weeks) benefited as well as patients with a treatment-free interval of less than 60 days (mediane survival time of 23.3 versus 13.2 weeks). The quality of life analysis showed a clear advantage for the topotecan-treated patients. An alternative is the administration of a combination chemotherapy with the ACO protocol, which was equivalent in a randomised study of topotekan monotherapy [1382]. In this study, approximately 60% of patients were pretreated for platinum, while the others had already received an anthracycle-content protocol in the initial line. In the randomised trial of Eckardt et al. 2007 [1384], the adverse effect profile and quality parameter analysis tended to favour topotecant monotherapy in this study. The survival rate was 33% for oral and 29% for IV. The oral topotecan was associated with fewer neutropenia and anaemia, but a slightly higher thrombocytopenia rate. The rate of infection was the same in both treatment arms. The meta-analysis of Horita with 1347 patients in the relapse situation of small cell lung cancer confirmed the results with remission rates in sensitive disease of 17% and a one-year survival of 27%.

In Phase II studies, containing protocols have achieved remission levels of up to 40% in patients with a randomised study of Goto et al Lancet Oncology, the only treatment option for Irinotecan, cisplatin, and Etopositide was shown to be significant in the treatment of one of these patients. This is the only randomised study in which a survival benefit of another therapy compared to topotecan was shown in the second line of therapy. There is no authorisation for Irinotecan in SCLC. Another large randomised phase III study is available for Icinotecan monotherapy compared to Topotecan and the combination of Irinotecan and the Ganglioside 6 Beha andlun ng of stage M1 (Extensive Disease) 379 antibodies dinutuximab with 471 patients. No OS difference between the 3 arms of therapy with a median of approximately 7 months was detectable (DISTINCT study ASCO 2019), [1387]. Amrubicin is also an alternative therapy, but it is not approved in Europe. In a randomised Phase III study of Pawel et al. 2014 in 637 patients could not be shown for patients in a sensitive situation with remission rate or overall survival compared with topotecin. However, there was a small survival benefit in patients in low frequency situations. Remission rates were promising. For refractory patients it was 22.2% (95% CI 11.2 - 37.1), for sensitive patients 45% (95%CI 32.1 - 58.4). [1389] Lurbinectidine was tested in combination with doxorubicin in the phase III ATLANTIS study in 613 patients against topotecan. The median overall survival was at 8.6 months (95% Ci 7.1 – 9.4) in the Lurbinectidine plus doxorubicin group slightly longer than in the control group at 7.6 months (6.6 – 8.2), but this difference was not significant. [ 1390] In Phase II and III studies, the significance of immunotherapeutic approaches was assessed. Pembrolizumab was evaluated in 2 Phase II studies (Keynote 028 and 158). In a total of 131 patients, the remission rate was 19%, the median PFS 2.0 months, and the median OS 7.7 months. Multiproportionally, the 2-year survival rate of 20. The study compared Nivolumab monotherapy with the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab. Remission rates were 10% for nivolubab and 23% for the combination. In 201 patients a determination of the tumour mutation load was performed. 73 patients had a high mutation load. In this group, a 1-year survival rate of 62% was achieved with the Nivolabab and ipilimumab combination, compared to only about 20% for low TMB. Whether TMB is a predictive factor for response to immunotherapy in the second therapy line, has not yet been clearly clarified. In Phase III studies, maintenance therapy with nivolumbab and nivolaba in combination with ipilimaumab and second-line therapy with Nivolumbaf were evaluated. Both studies were formally negative for the overall collective. In Phase II, rovalpituzumab tesirins, a conjugate of a chemotherapeutically active substance and an antibody against delta-like protein3. DLL-3 is expressed butrant in approximately 80% of small cell lung carcinomas and induced by a neuroendocrine transcription factor. Rova-T achieved a remission rate of 34% in 61 patients with relapsed SCLC and disease stabilization in 31%. Thus, in this Phase II study, two thirds of patients benefited from the therapy. A randomized second line study (TAHOE) compared rova-t with topotecan. However, this was prematurely discontinued due to inferiority of the rova-t. In this phase II study two third of patients benefitted from the treatment. A transient second line trial (TAHOE) with a prior survival benefit was not shown. There are only a few clinical studies available for the late relapse situation. Small phase II studies showed remission rates of more than 50% [1392] (evidence level 2b) for reinduction therapy with the first-line chemotherapy protocol. A retrospective multicenter analysis of 2015 showed a remission rate of 45% in 112 sensitive patients and re-induction, a median PFS of 5.5 months and a mean overall survival of 21.4 months [1393]. Summary and evaluation • In case of recurrence or progression, a distinction should be made between local and systemic progression. • In the case of a local progression, the possibility of local therapy should be evaluated. • For systemic progression, patients' prognosis is the better the longer the therapy-free interval. In the event of late recurrence, reinduction treatment is the treatment of the first choice. In all other cases, switching of the therapy regimen is useful. • Relapse is the superiority of the combination of topcanote. Combination Cisplatin/Irinotecan/Etoposide a significant advantage compared to topotecan. • All other regimens have not been able to demonstrate superiority to topotacan monotherapy. These include approaches with the chemotherapy substances amrubicin and lurbinectidine, the angiogenesis inhibitors aflibercept and bevacizumab and the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab. • Checkpoint inhibitors have undoubtedly also an effect in the second line and can achieve longer-term survival in 10 to 15% of patients.

The rate of symptomatic brain metastases after one year in the irradiated group was almost 15% compared to 40% in non-executive RT, but there were no CT or MRI controls prior to randomisation. This survival advantage was explained by the fact that prophylactic cranium radiation significantly reduced the rate of brain metastatics in the first year of treatment, but no Ct or MRT controls were performed in the second line chemotherapy group. An MRI examination of the brain to exclude already existing brain metastases was in contrast to the above study inclusion criterion. Also in the further course of every 3 months MRI skull investigations took place. The rate of second line chemotherapy was also in the non irradiated group 90%. As a result, no effect of prophylactic brain irradiation on the overall survival was shown here but still under the PCI a relevant reduction of the incidence of brain metastatics of 45% vs. 69%.

Stereotactic irradiation can occur simultaneously to a combined chemo immunotherapy. Strong consensus radiation in detectable cerebranous metastasation: In patients with primary brain metastasia, extracerebral chemotherapy alone is significantly higher than intracerral chemotherapy [1394]. In the EORTC study of Postmus et al. 2000 [1397], patients with cerebral metastasis were compared with chemotherapy alone for irradiation with concomitant chemotherapy. In 120 patients, teniposide 120mg/m2 day 1, 3 and 5 was used as chemotherapy in both arms. In the irradiated arm, a cranial exposure of 30 Gy was performed. Following chemotherapy alone, the response was 21% with 8% complete remissions and after combined radiotherapy 57% with 30% complete respiration. On the median survival time of the patients, radiation had only a minor influence (3.2 vs. 3.5 months). However, there was a significant increase in the rate of patients who survived 6 and 12 months respectively. Thus, the study showed an advantage for additional radiation therapy (evidence level 1b) The modification of brain radiation as hippocampus-saving radiation in brain metastases of the SCLC resulted in a phase II study [1398] more favourable results in terms of neurocognitive effect, and an improved quality of life and memory performance. In a phase II study [1398], irradiation in brain metastases of SCLC showed more favourable results in relation to the neurocognitive effect, and improved quality of life and memory performance. Only 10% of later brain metastatics occurred in this region, which would then be accessible to stereotaxia (SRS). 9.6 Beha EK andlun ng of stage M1 (Extensive Disease) 384 A comparison with PCI of whole brain irratiation with or without hippocampus protection also revealed a functional advantage for patients. [1399] The randomised studies using primary combined chemo immunotherapy did not provide sufficient experience for parallel use of whole-brain irraitation. In the IMPOWER 133 study and in the KEYNOTE 604 study, patients were only included after prior exposure, in the CASPIAN study only asymptomatic patients. Therefore, the toxicity of the procedure is difficult to estimate. In SCLC, the performance of the induction of the FIvenology was analyzed in patients. For the overall group, the median OS was 8.5 months, it was longer in patients with brain metastasis than in patients who had 6-10 brain metastatics (11.0 months vs. 8.5 months). Brain metastases risk of recurrence was 42% at 12 months after irradiation, the local control was high with 93%. Stereotaxia is therefore an alternative therapy course in patients it of a limited number of brain metastases with however a high risk of further brain metastalsis. Consolidating mediastinal radiation consensus-based recommendation tested 2024 patients with SCLC stage IV in good general condition with remission after initial line system therapy can be offered a consolidating mediastial and primary tumor irraitation, especially if limited remote metastasation and/or a high thoracic tumor load were present. Strong consensus In patients with very good partial or full response to remote metastatic therapy already indicate the results of Jeremic et al. 1999 [1400], the consolidative end-to-tumour survival was randomised in the first-hour period. (30 Gy/3 Gy) consolidating mediastinal irradiation [1401], [1402] in patients with metastatic SCLC tested in good general condition with first-line system therapy response. Although the study showed no benefit with respect to 1-year survival, a significantly improved 2-year survival together with a highly significant improved progression-free survival was found. Therefore, responders, especially with limited remote metastasis and high intrahoracic tumor load, should be offered a consolidation mediastinal irratiation. 9.6 Beha EK andlun ng of stage M1 (Extensive Disease) 385 Symptom-oriented palliative irra tiation consensus-based recommendation tested 2024 The indications for palliatory irra diation at \"places of emergency, e.g. thoracic or osssary should be checked regularly in the course of the disease at SCLC stage IV symptomal and fund-related. Strong consensus In case of insufficient local tumour control by single chemotherapy, chemotherapy-resistant complete irradication is not available in the presence of the tumour, to the disease or to be administered. Accordingly, in case of painful or complication-drending bone or organ metastases, radiation therapy has an exclusively palliative analgesic and complication inhibiting goal and is not used primarily for the purpose of prolonging survival time. Summary and evaluation In patients with remission, prophylactic cranial radiation should be offered following chemotherapy as it reduces the incidence of brain metastasis. If PCI is not performed, 3-month MRI brain control should be performed. Patients with brain metastatics should receive cranical radiation during treatment. This should be done in symptomatic patients with multilocular metastasy rather prior to combined chemo-immun therapy, but in asymptomatic patients more afterwards. If available, a hippocampus-sparable radiation may be used in patients with a higher frequency of tumour response in SCLC. EK apie d of older patients 386 Treatment of elderly patients Aspects of chemotherapy Consensus-based recommendation reviewed 2024 Patients aged > 75 years have higher haematotoxicity and a reduced rate of metabolism of chemotherapy. The choice of chemotherapy dosage at SCLC should take account of these limitations. Strong consensus consensus-based Recommendation tested 2024 In patients > 85 years of age with SCLC, the indication of chemotherapy should be presented individually. Here, dose-reduced protocols or possibly weekly and well-controlled regimens should be used. Strong agreement background Age per se is not a negative prognosis factor and basically the efficacy of chemotherapy in older patients is not different from a younger patient's collective. So far, only a few studies on chemotherapy effectiveness in elderly patients are explicitly present [1403], [1404]. These confirm that in particular the combination of carboplatin/Etoposide also has high efficacy with tolerable side effects in elderly people. Also in the Phase II study of Quoix et al. (2001) with the use of the combination Etoposid and Carboplatine were achieved by 1 day of 76 days of 770. The Japanese study of Okamoto et al. 2005 [1405] examined carboplatin/ etoposide against a three-day split cisplatin in combination with etoposide. A total of 220 predominantly elderly patients with extensive disease were included. Carboplatine was given at a dose of AUC5 in combination to etoponide 80 mg/m2 day 1-3. Cisplatin was administered at 25 mg/ m2 day-1-3 in combination and etopose 80 mg / m2 on the same days. The study did not show any difference between the two arms of therapy. Remission rate was 73%, mean survival was 10.6 versus 9.8 months, and one-year survival was 35 % versus 41. Cisplatin / etoPoside and carboplasm / etopide therefore appear to have similar efficacy in older patients as well. In the case of cisplatine/ etonposide, the incidence of adverse effects is apparently reduced by dividing the cispplatin dose. 9.7 Therapy d Recommendations B of Eviden Level of Etoposid.",

Therefore, the indication for radiotherapy has to be critically evaluated in the elderly patient. However, in the case of appropriate patient selection, the conduct of simultaneous chemo radiation therapy is generally possible in older patients, as compared with the treatment protocol of younger patients with limited disease. The study of Shield et al. 2005 [1406] has included a subgroup analysis for the elderly group of patients in the NCCTG study regarding hyperfractional versus conventional fractional simultaneous chemultane radiation therapy. In this study, a total of 209 younger and 54 older patients were enrolled in this study but compared the two- and five-year survival rates showed no significant difference between the different age groups with two-year lifetime rates of 33% and five year survival rates of 22% in the presence rate of 1 year. However, if the basic surgical risk increases with age, and in particular pneumectomy and lobectomy are associated with higher risk in elderly patients than in younger patients, then the criteria for surgery (see section 4.1) are given. In principle, the possibility of surgical resection is also to be examined in older patients (recommendation level D). This recommendation is based on the assumption that the surgical risk in the 9.7 of the apie of the elderly patients is small cell lung. Studies on the operantal system are available. © Onk ncarcinoma guidance programme similar to that of the non-small cell lung carcinoma of cell carcinomas of higher age are not carcinogenic. This chapter is currently subject to a comprehensive update. Until the end of the update, this chapter is exposed to malignancies of the pleuraine effusion 390 treatment of lung cancer with interventional procedures (chapter currently suspended due to ongoing revision). The rate of respiratory complication after poudrage (13.5%) is higher than after administration of the talc via thorax drainage (5.6%) [1408] (evidence level 1b). The rate for respiratory complications is lower when using talc with a particle size greater than 10 μm [1412], [1413] (providence level 2a). Poudrages can be performed in general anesthesia or local anaesthesis [1414],[1416],.[1417],(evidence grade 1a). The application of pleurodese via a thoracic drainage is less effective than a poudrage, but more effective than one drainage alone [1419], (evident level 1a) is not effective. The rotational storage of the patient after injection of talc via thorax drainage is not meaningful [1422] (evidence level 2b). Permanent drainage or pleuroperitoneal shunts can be used in trapped lungs, but the complication rate is high due to displacement of drainage or infections (15-21%) [1423], [1424],[1425] (Evidence level 4). Publications have not investigated the symptom of air distress but isolates the effect of the measures on pleural effusion. Depending on the extent of the primary tumor or lung metastasis, it is possible that the symptoms of the patients are not affected by the evacuation of pleural exfuse. It can be assumed that the treatment of recurrent and symptomatic pleural discharge by a single effective measure in contrast to repeated interventions by the patient is seen as more favourable.

Mild haemoptysen often do not require intervention, but patients with stronger haemoptyses should be given a blood-feeding therapy with palliative or curative objective. Emergency measures and diagnostics Curative therapy by resection of the bleeding lung area is usually not possible due to the inoperability of the tumour. Consequently, in the case of haemoptoe, an opening of the central respiratory tract and the diagnosis of the tuberculosis is not necessary in the foreground. The most important diagnostic measure is bronchoscopy. In addition, a CT of thorax may be necessary for haemorrhage localisation or staging [1429] (evidence level 1c). Therapy Bronchoscopy is used for diagnostic purposes to identify the source of bleeding and therapeutically to remove blood and/or coagula. In bronchoscopic haemostasis, ice water and/ or vasoactive substances (e.g. 1 ml of adrenaline 1:10 000 to 10 ml isotonic NaCl solution) are used with the intention of vasoconstriction. In haemoptoe, bronchoposcopically, the corresponding lappenbronchus can be tamponised by means of balloon catheters, which is subsequently left for 24-48 hours [1430] (evidence level 3b). In case of continuation of hemoptoe after local measures, the bronchial arteriography and subsequent bronchia artery embolisation (BAE) clinical practice is, however, limited to the study results of 12. Embolisates were primarily used as platinum coils, gelantine and polyvenyl alcohol particles, or combinations [1432], [1435].

Percutaneic radiotherapy resulted in a higher rate of symptom enhancements 8 weeks after therapy and the patients treated in this way required less local treatment (evidence level 2b). Endoluminary brachytherapy can lead to an improved rate of reaeration and a longer duration of symptom reduction in stenosing central lung tumours [1526], [1527], but also a similar increase in palliative effect can be achieved by higher-dose percutanous radiation therapy (evident grade 2b) following percutant radiotherapy.

Even after radiation therapeutic pretreatment, longer-lasting tumour regressions can be achieved with endobronchial brachytherapy [1529] (Evidence level 3b). Risks of brachy therapy are the formation of fistula and bleeding. Dosage of endobronic brachytherapie: The macroscopically visible tumor portion should be safely recorded in bronchus lengthwise direction. The afterloading catheter should be centered in bronchusmitte. Usual doses per fraction range from 5-10 Gy, applied with high dose power (HDR). The dosage is usually calculated at 10 mm axis spacing. In addition to percutaneous radiation therapy, brachy treatment is recommended at a dose of 2 x 4.8 to 2 x 7.5 Gy with a time interval of at least one week. early, invasive or in situ carcinomas in curative intention are used if surgical resection is not preferred here [1477] (evidence level 5). As an alternative to endoluminal brachytherapy for small tumor volumes, percutaneous precision radiation therapy methods are now available. Evidence-based recommendation 2010 grade In patients without radiation therapeutic pre-loading, the use of brachy therapy in palliative intention in individual cases is suitable for centrally stenosing tumors.

Furthermore, in the S3, guideline Pallliative medicine there are many other topics relevant to this patient group, such as therapy determination and criteria for decision-making, fatigue, anxiety or death wishes, to which we refer at this point. Definition palliativ Medicine is an approach to improving the quality of life of patients and their families, while confronting them with pre-difficultial problems and suffering. Dyspnoea Introduction Dyspnoe is a complex, multidimensional and subjective symptom [1531], [1532]. Physical, psychological, emotional and functional factors affect the limitations of breathing. These factors as well as the subjective perception of the patient determine the severity of dyspnoea and the impairment of quality of life [1533]. \"A breathlessness is a common symptom in patients with advanced cancer. A register survey in 5,014 cancer patients in stationary palliative and hospice facilities in Germany in the years 2006–2008 revealed a respiratory distress prevalence of 53.4% [1534]. The highest prevalence showed patients with lung cancer (74.3%). These results are confirmed by data from other countries [1535],[1536],.[1537] Cancer patients with pulmonary, pleural or mediastinal involvement suffer more frequently and more severely from respiratory distress [1538]. In the final phase of a cancer, the incidence and severity of respiratory distress are increased. The tumor-related causes of dyspnoea in patients with lung cancer are not multifaceted (see table below).

The following should be taken into account: • Consideration of the medical indication • Stress and benefit for the patient • Patient's will Consensus Background The recommendations were adapted on the basis of the recommendations of the S3 guideline Palliative Medicine based on an expert consensus. Following modifications of the original recommendations were made: The recommendations of S3 guidelines Palliativmedizin are formulated for the target group \"Patients with non-healable cancer\". In the adaptation process for the S 3 guideline Lung carcinoma, the recommendations were reviewed which effects on the target population \"Pidients with a non-cureable lung cancer\" (NSCLC IV or SCLC extensive disease). This target group was designated only insufficiently during the transmission into the current guideline. \"Objective measurement methods (e.g. blood gas analysis, pulmonary function test) or parameters (e .g. increased respiratory frequency) are therefore not suitable for the detection of symptoms of epilepsy and disease. and multifactorial symptom that is modulated by physical (and functional), emotional, cognitive, spiritual and social dimensions of man, breathing distress can be further differentiated within the scope of a more detailed detection [1542]. To adequately capture these dimensions, three areas are described for detection (see table below).

Due to the high respiratory distress prevalence in patients suffering from lung carcinoma, relevant key recommendations for the drug-related therapy of respiratory deficiency in lung cancer patients in the adaptation process of the s3 guideline Pulmonary carcinome should be taken over to the S 3 guideline Pallliative Medicine. Opiate Evidence Based Recommendation 2024 degrees In patients with pulmonary carcinomas and respiratory symptoms, parnotal lindenoma should be used for the treatment of the respiratory disease. Opiate evidence-based recommendation tested 2024 grade In patients with lung carcinoma and respiratory distress, oral or parenteral opioids should be used for symptomatic relief of shortness of breath. Cave: causative therapy of short breath should be taken into account (see Recommendation 14.2.) nce [1542], [1544],[1545],.[1546], [...]1547], ...1548, [ 1549], Chinese [1550], and [1552], \"1553],] [1555], Consensus Evidence-based statement assessed 2024 nce There is no indication that a lay artis-based therapy of breathlessness in patients with pulmonary carcinomas with opiides results in clinically relevant respiratory depression. .2 Dys spnoe evidence- based statement evaluated 2024 consensus background \"Opioides are the only drug group with adequate study evidence regarding symptomatic respiratory depression\" is understood to be ‘incomplete'. Studies in patients with chronic heart failure show that endogenous opioids play an important role in modelling the perception of respiratory distress [1565]. Studies using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) indicate a similar close link between shortness of breath and emotions as in pain, with lower breathlessness associated with reduced activity in emotional areas such as the island bark and at the same time increased activity in central cave grey [1566], [1567]. This is associated with perception of the emotional sensation of breathlessness as \"uncomfortable\" (unpleasant feeling due to breathlessness or unpleasantness, in the English unpleasentness) [1568]. Opioides can lead to reduced activity not only in these brain areas but also in the relief of breath distress In Barnes' review there was a strong effect for morphine and dihydrocodein, for hydromorphone, ororal diamorphine (not on sale in Germany) [1509], oxycodon or fentanyl could not be shown as an effect on clinical application group. Based on clinical experience, the Palliative Medicine guideline group assumes that the efficacy of the previously untested opioids and forms of application (except misted or inhaled) is also based on the clinical experience and external evidence that the mean effective dose to relieve shortness of breath is usually lower than to relieve pain [1570].[450] \"Opioid therapy for the relief of short breath should therefore be started with a low dose followed by titration until the effective relief of difficulty of breath. When using retarded opiides, the reduction of short breathe seems to be greater than in fast release opiloids [1571]. The majority of patients experience symptom relief at a daily dose of 10-30 mg morphine p. o. [15 70]. If patients already receive opiroids, e.g. for pain therapy, the existing dose of opiide may need to be increased to achieve additional relief of breathlessness. The existing dose of opioids is increased in order to achieve an additional relief of respiratory distress. [450] \"For fear of respiratory depression, there are still reservations about the use of opicoids. None of the clinical studies carried out could demonstrate clinically relevant respiratory depression or a decrease in oxygen saturation or an increase in pCO2, regardless of the underlying disease and whether the patients were opiloidnaive or opiroidtolerant [1548], 14.2 Dyspnoe Recommendationg Level of Eviden Table 36: D Benzodiaz lorazepam midazolam [1572], [1570],[1573]. It is an important task to clarify this issue explicitly so that this highly effective therapy does not prevent patients with respiratory distress from experiencing anxiety.[450] Against possible opiogenic adverse reactions (in particular nausea and constipation) should be used in patients [1532]. Benzodiazepine Evidenz-based recommendation 2024 degrees is used to assess the incidence of olanzapine in patients with pulmonary cancer. Strong consensus background \"Benzodiazepines are frequently used in palliative medicine in patients with shortness of breath and clinical experience is considered to be good in terms of efficacy, especially in patients who have an increased anxiety or panic response. However, there is no evidence of study evidence for the effective relief of respiratory distress by benzodiacepines [1576].\" [441] \"Despite the lack of external evidence, but due to good clinical experience, therapy with benzodiozepine is recommended as second or third-line therapy by the Palliative Medicine guideline group (open \"Can\" recommendation), in particular if opioids or non-medicamental treatments are not sufficiently effective or if an additional fear or panic component is present. Combination therapy with opiides is recommended, in particular, in patients at an advanced stage of disease or in the death phase [1552], [1577]. A low starting dose is chosen and the dose may be adjusted after efficacy (see Table 32) [See Table 32] [See D. A low starting dose is chosen and the dose may be adjusted according to efficacy (see Table 32) [Note: Red.: in S3 guideline Palliative Medicine] . Breathlessness has a distinct affective component, in which emotions, personality, memory and expectations influence the perception of breathlessness [1582]. Since breathing distress (and especially respiratory distress) can cause anxiety and panic in many patients, appropriate measures to reduce anxiety should also be offered to the patient as part of the non-medicinal measures. Any technique that the patient can use for himself at a desired time promotes self-confidence and initiative. This reduces the risk of depression and increases the quality of life of the patients [1583]. Respiratory distress, cooling of the face through open windows, hand compartments or fans, as well as the involvement of relatives, in particular with the aim of reducing stress and panic in case of severe breathing distress, and calming the patient [1583]. It is important to keep ready emergency measures for respiratory distress attacks, which can also be practiced in the form of exercises/rituals ...[1584], [1585],[1586]. Anxiety or panic. [450] Targeted physiotherapeutic measures have been shown to be beneficial for the symptom control and strengthening of individual coping strategies in all phases of lung cancer. They include massages, inhalations, respiratory therapy and aromatherapy. 14.3 Shhmerze en 419 Pain Definition \"According to the definition of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), pain is \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or described with, current or potential tissue damage [1591]. In addition to the physical component (nociception), mental, social and spiritual dimensions play a role in tumour pain. Cicely Saunders, in this sense, shaped the concept of \"total pain\", which is the interrelationality of physical, mental, and spiritual components of pain [1592]. The subjective perception of pain is the result of complex interaction of external and internal physical, social, and religious factors [1593]. Nociceptor pain caused by the direct irritation of pain receptors and neuropathic pain resulting from irritation and compression of peripheral nerves are to be distinguished. Pain assessment \"A basic diagnosis of pain analysis is a necessary prerequisite for rational pain therapy.\" [450] \"At the beginning and in the course of this study, patients (with a lung carcinoma disease - the author's remark) should be asked and examined for the presence of pain. This should be part of the symptoms assessment. The basic diagnosis is used to record the spread and dynamics of pain, the cause of pain (tumour and therapy-related, independent of cancer and therapy), the pain type (nociceptive, neuropathical) and the pain intensity. The location of the pain areas (with/without radiation) can be documented in a body drawing. Pain intensity can be recorded, e.g. by means of a four-stage verbal rating scale (VRS): no, mild, medium and strong pain [1594] or an eleven-stage numerical rating scale of pain [NRS450, 0– drug use). or an 11-stage numerical rating scale (NRS, 0–10). Paracetamol) is relieved, in addition to oral stage II opioids or low-dose stage III opiloids are used [1595], [1596],[1597]. For patients with moderate to severe tumour pain, stage III oral opiides such as morphine, hydromorphone and oxycodone are recommended [1598], (1599], (1600], (‘1601', [1602]. \"Levometadon is sometimes considered an alternative to oral morphin [1594]. However, due to its special pharmacokinetic properties and a very long and unpredictable half-life [1603], a careful, individualised dose adjustment is required. In patients who are unable to swallow, suffering from nausea and vomiting, or in patients at the end of their lives who are no longer able to take oral medication due to weakness or exhaustion [1605], [1606]. Subcutaneous administration of morphine and hydromorphone is recommended as a first choice method in this case.[450] In opioid therapy, continuous constipation prophylaxis should be observed [1595],[1607]. Breakthrough pains should be treated with oral, fast-release opiloids or transmucosal fentanyl delivery forms [1594],.[1608], terminal stage care Introduction The metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma is the most common cause of death due to cancer worldwide [1610]. Patients with metastatic pulmonary carcinomas suffer from a high burden of symptoms and are affected by a comparable low quality of life; the median survival time is less than one year [1611], <1613]. Extensive knowledge of mortality control with its different challenges in the physical, psychological, social and spiritual dimensions should be one of the natural prerequisites of the treaters. Sensitive, open and honest communication with the patient and family is just as necessary as an attitude in the accompaniment of the dying, in which death is assumed as a natural process. \"All measures should be guided by the goal of achieving the best possible quality of life and death in dignity even in the last phase of life.\" [450] For the care of lung carcinoma patients in the terminal stage, the key recommendations or statements of the S3 guideline Palliative Medicine must be taken into account.[450].

Haloperidol; muscarinated anticholinergics, e.g. butylscopolamine. When medications can no longer be swallowed, the form of application should be adjusted. All medications necessary in the death phase can be administered subcutaneously. On the basis of studies and the clinical experience and evaluation of experts, the administration of artificial nutrition and fluid intake during the death phase cannot be recommended (see below). Thus, the artificial fluid intake in a current .4 treatment g in terminal stage 423 placebo-controlled RCT did not show any improvement in symptoms, quality of life or survival [1615], [1616]. For parenteral fluid substitution in the death phase, race lath can be increased by increased secretion production and should therefore be terminated during the death period [1625], [1626],[1627]. The previous pharmacological therapy in race latching is based on anticholinergic drugs that inhibit the production of secretion and thus reduce the formation of fluid accumulation [1628].

All measures should be guided by the goal of achieving the best possible quality of life and death in dignity, even in the last phase of their lives. [...] Content of the talks should be in addition to the current physical burden of symptoms and concerns for future complaints. Since in patients with lung cancer the fear of dying is often associated with fear of suffocation, this question should be addressed with the necessary mindfulness in the enlightening communication. In addition to physical symptom load, psychosocial and spiritual needs are to be asked.

If necessary, appropriate contacts should be provided. In a compassionately respectable manner, it should be clarified and documented which life-preserving measures should not be exercised in the context of rehabilitation. Terminal stage 425 Rehabilitation Rehabilitation serves to re-enforce the ability to participate in post-treatment disorders and includes outpatient and inpatient measures, which are provided by appropriately equipped institutions (clinics, rehabilitation centres, practices). The outpatiently performed pneumological rehabilitation, as well as the inpatient form, is oriented towards a holistic rehabilitation concept for the restoration of lost functions, including social medicine assessment, and must include a comprehensive, rehabilitation-specific, interdisciplinary therapy offering, which, according to the individual situation of the rehabilitant, aims at the physical, psychological and social components including an educational component (framework recommendation of the Federal Employment Association for Rehabilitation BAR), in order to give effect to the legal claim \"Reha before retirement and \"reha before nursing\". The essential treatment elements of the pneumatic-oncological rehabilitation are medical advice and care, social medicine evaluation, medical therapy, health education / health training, structured smoking cessation, medical training therapy (duration, strength, coordination, respiration therapy, respiratory muscle training, rehabilitation, follow-up therapy for the treatment of the patient. Incentive of occupational benefits, housing design). Studies on the effectiveness of rehabilitation in lung cancer patients are difficult because group comparisons with patients without rehabilitation are problematic both from an ethical point of view and for legal reasons. Therefore, there is no data on whether rehabilitation is superior to the spontaneous course after primary treatment of lung cancer in terms of improvement of follow-up disorders. There are very few studies on whether outpatient or inpatient rehabilitation is useful in patients with lung cancer, at most a trend can be identified by investigations with small case numbers and pre-postanalyses within defined groups. Few publications [1629], [1630], BAR guidelines with framework recommendations on on oncological rehabilitation [1631] exist on principles and standards of oncology rehabilitation. They refer to expert opinions and unsystematic summaries (Evidenzgrad 5).

Complex interdisciplinary rehabilitation programs, as offered in the German-speaking area, have not been investigated. During oncology therapy (also in high-dose therapy) aerobic endurance sports activities can be performed with good efficiency (e.g. in relation to bone marrow regeneration) [1638],.[1639] It is not established whether this also applies to multimorbid patients with lung carcinoma. However this working group could show in operated patients (n = 27 lung surgery patients) that an aerobic endurance and relaxation training has a positive effect on fatigue and physical performance in cancer patients [1640] Evidenzgrad Schultz et al.

In the case of patients with remote metastases or not curative treatment, the focus is on symptom freedom and the preservation of the best possible quality of life. In the NSCLC, the frequency of relapses (LR) or remote metastatics (FM) within 5 years depends on the stage of initial diagnosis [1644] (evidence grade1a): stage IA LR 10%; FM 15% stage IB LR 10 %; FM 30% stage II LR 12%; FM 40% stage III LR 15%; FM 60% While the likelihood of a recurrence tumor is highest in the first two years after resection, the proportion of secondary carcinomas is increasing with the distance to surgery [637], [1645] (Evidence grade 1b). The follow-up measures are based on the tumour stage, the multimodal therapy performed, the assessment of the patient's risk situation and the patient ' s symptomatic. 2. In patients with initial proven distant metastasis and the lack of options for locally ablative treatment of primary tumor and metastibiase therapy, the following is not a long-term study. In these patients, the term \"follow-up\" is not used here, but rather \"follow up\" or \"roll-through monitoring including control examinations\". Many of these patients are also subject to ongoing system therapy (e.g. TKI, maintenance chemotherapy, checkpoint inhibitor) and here, in addition to the use of additional alternative system therapies, the use for locally consolidated, symptomatic local therapies with radiation therapy is important. In addition, we are also asked to provide the justification for the continuation of often very expensive systemic therapies and to critically assess the overall situation of the patient. In the meantime, it has also become clear that the results of patients treated in clinical studies – well-considered with clearly defined imaging control studies – are significantly better overall than of patients who are treated under \"real world\" conditions. Perhaps due to the early detection of non-response of the therapies are a conversion to second- or third-line therapy within the context of \"excessive world\". Formal: Evidence grade IIa). Conversely, if we want to achieve a similar good result for a patient in stage IV as the data from the large randomized phase III studies, we need to evaluate it a) in the same risk stations b) treat with the same treatment protocols c) evaluate with comparable imaging and clinical follow-up controls so that we can change the treatment concepts early – as in clinical studies – in progression. These facts are known for a long time, but are rarely taken into account in practice. If these experiences are gathered from clinical studies and from the previous approaches at large lung cancer centers, the following evidence-based recommendations emerge: Consensus-based recommendation modified 2024 After completion of a multimodal therapy (Stadium I-IIIC, OMD), which includes a local ablative procedure (OP, RTx, CTx/RTx), a structured follow-ups plan should be established for each patient. The structured follow up plan should also be appropriate, Recidive, secondary carcinomas, complications and toxicity of therapy and therapy should be identified with the consensus-based approach to therapy. In the course of systemic therapy (stage IVA, IVB) a structured schedule/follow-up plan should be established for each patient. The structured schedule / follow-up schedule should be suitable to detect progression/relapse, secondary carcinomas, complications and toxicities of therapy and the need for psychooncology, palliative medicine and social counselling. Strong consensus on quitting tobacco smoking In a retrospective cohort study on the effect of inhaled tobacco smoking on outcome under therapy, it could be shown that active smokers had pulmonary events four weeks after surgery 2.7 times as often. Preoperative quitting of smoking reduces the incidence of postoperative complications ([76] (Evidenzgrad 2b). A further cohort study confirmed this observation [405] (evidence level 2b]). Retrospective studies of Tsao and employees were able to show both for chemotherapy and for chemo-radiotherapy that an active dose level of Bh has been shown to be 16.3.",

Except for a single prospective examination and as a consequence the propective-raandomized phase III study [1645] are all other studies retrospectively cohort studies. In addition there are a number of individual follow-up plans at the individual tumor centres and lung cancer centers, which were usually not prospectively validated. The aftercare includes several parameters. This also increasingly includes the detection of posttherapeutic complications (keywords: post-pneumonectomy syndrome after surgery, radiation fibrosis after CT/RT the incidence of diabetes, but in the case of clinical surgery. In the case of lung carcinoma, however, there are currently extremely rare (Exner et al, DKK 2018, JTO 2022, Nadjim et al. DKK 2018,JTO 2022) for the future to demand. Detection of post-therapeutic complications First, post-therapeutic complications are to be recorded.After surgical resection, pain states, infections or loss of lung function are in the foreground, after radiotherapy the oesophagitis and pneumonitis, but also affections of the skin, heart or back brand (evidence grade 1b) [1648], [1649],[1650],.[1651]. Also, in order to be able to better estimate late toxicity, prospective clinical survival analyses or studies are urgently required (ExNER DKK 2018,jTO 2022, Najm DKK 2018, jTO .3 Nac chsorg ge after a local ablative therapy 432 symptom-oriented follow-up after-care after a fixed schedule It is discussed as before controversial whether patients receive a symptom-related treatment at a regular stage. After 446 patients who had been operated on in stage I, there were 135 recurrences. Despite the fixed schedules in post-care (4 months over the first 2 years after surgery), most patients (53%) were symptomatic with relapses [1652] (Formal: Evidence Grade 2b). In a small series of Chiu et al., 14 out of 38 patients had recurrence after curative tumor resection. Of these 14 patients, 7 were symptomatically (50%) [1653] (Formal: Evidence Level 2b), while other studies show benefits for post-treatment with fixed schedule. Lamont et al, in a retrospective study, describes that the detection of metachronic secondary tumours can be promoted by such a follow-up program. In this study, however, there was no clinical idea, an X-ray thorax, and an annual thoracic CT. 19 metachronous tumours were secured, 16 of these 19 patients did not have an outcome of treatment. In the first three to four years, however, there was no difference in survival data due to the structured imaging follow-up examinations. However, after four to five years, a clear, significant difference in the discovery and diagnosis of secondary tumours was observed. These can then be treated in part again curatively. Comparable findings are also found in the large screening studies with low-dose CT in NSCLC patients in the subgroup with anametically known NSClc (NLST, NELSON). Lung cancer-specific survival was significantly more favourable in the screened randomisation groups in both studies. For imaging, clear data for the future in patients with lung tumours have been determined in these risk collectives after local ablation of the primary tumor (formal evidence level: 1a) Cost-benefit analyses In numerous studies, in addition to various methods, the cost effectiveness of various follow-on protocols after operative therapy has been investigated at the same time. For other modalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or the combination, one of these studies is not available from Walsh and employee evaluation of Ntropiatic resection. The authors, however, assume that this is an effect in the sense of the lead time bias [1655] (Evidence Level 2b). Egermann et al. analyzed 563 patients with NSCLC over a period of 10 years [1643]. All patients had been operated under curative objective. Patients received a follow-up with history, physical examination and .3 Nac chsorg following local ablative therapy 433 X-ray thorax every 3 months for the first 2 years and then 6-monthly until the 5th year followed by annual post-care intervals. Only 3.8% of 361 patients had a resectable tumor in the follow- up. 21 patients with metachronic secondary tumour were detected and operated under curatorial objective. Here, a survival advantage of 9 months was assumed. The authors concluded that after-care with short time intervals compared to purely symptom-oriented follow-ups were not shown as a benefit of survival and not as a cost-effective expression of light. However, these patients had to be treated with a significant dose of radiation. In contrast, the screening studies were able to represent the significant effectiveness of this investigation method in a randomised comparison. This is particularly true for the special risk group NSCLC with pre-lung cancer For screening, the first positive cost-benefit analyses have already been carried out (see: IQWIG report on screening). For patients with lung cancer in their history, the data can be adapted accordingly. However, studies on cost-effectiveness analyses tailored to the German or Austrian health system are not yet available at this time, but it can be assumed that similar results are available here. After-care with less intensive examination methods versus follow-up care with intensive investigation methods Virgo et al. investigated retrospectively different after-care strategies. In the one group, intensive routine follow-ups were carried out with annual appointments where laboratory values were collected and an X-ray thorax was performed. In addition, the patients received a bronchoscopy with sputum cytology and a thoracic CT. These results contradict the results of Westeel et al who conducted a prospective study in France [1645]. This study dealt with the feasibility of intensive follow-up care (1st presentation one month after completion of therapy, then 3-month visit with physical examination and X-ray thorax and 6-month bronchoscopy and thoracic CT for the first three years). Of the 192 evaluable patients, 136 developed a recurrence. 36 of these patients with relapse were asymptomatic. 35 of these asymptomatic patients were detected by the post-care procedure. In 15 of these subjects, the pulmonary relapses could be curatively operated, the survival of those patients was significantly prolonged. This trial was the basis for the randomized phase III study carried out later in France. .3 Nac chsorg following a local ablative therapy 434. In this prospective analysis, however, there was not only a significant prolongation of survival but also a cost effect on both the intervals as well as on the whole survival methods. In the meantime, the results of the randomized IFCT study ([1658]) have been presented internationally, but they are not clearly classified. In the first three to four years, however, there were no differences in survival data due to the structuring imaging follow-up studies. However, after four to five years, there was a clear, significant difference in the discovery and diagnosis of secondary tumours. These can then be partially treated curatively. The long-term survival results of this study are still pending, but the DFS advantage for the more intensely reared group leaves a positive assessment of the study results for the above-mentioned question. There is a large heterogeneity in the various strategies for post-care after curative treatment of an NSCLC. In available guidelines, the follow-ups intervals vary from 3 to 6 months for the first 2-3 years. In imaging, a uniform X-ray thorax is required, in part, a half-yearly/yearly CT and a bronchoscopy is also used. The benefit of tumour markers in the post-care of lung carcinoma is not documented by studies. Therefore, the routine determination of serum markers is not recommended in the follow-up care of lung cancer. Also for the screening of brain metastases in the aftercare and the importance of outcome there are currently no clinical data available, so that a screening of cerebral metastasis can not be recommended in clinically inconspicuous patients without clear risk indication. However, this point is different in risk situations with LD-SCLC, ED-SClc and especially with the question of using PCI or alternative imaging observation with the conduct of PCI or stereotaxia of metastas. On the contrary, in a chosen observation strategy as in the Japanese study with ED- SCLC an MRT skull is performed every three months. This must be taken into account in the choice of a watch and wait procedure today. Meanwhile, there is also in the stage IVA and IVB NSCLC risk-collective between high cumulative development of the brain with EGF-R. The longer patients survive with lung carcinoma, the higher the cumulative risk of developing relevant cerebral metastases, which then need to be treated. With the modern possibilities of even ablative therapy of up to 10-20 brain metastasis (stereotactic radiotherapy, cyber Knife, tomotherapy etc) a situation has arisen here, where early detection of locally controlled herds is likely to become much more important in the future.

These intervals start with initial conception within 8 weeks after completion of therapy.

In patients with NSCLC, SCLC without local ablative therapies The concept of primary therapy for IVA/B patients at NSCLS and Stage IV at SCLC has changed completely since 2018. Standard therapy for these patients is now the primary induction chemotherapy with chemoimmun therapy for 4-5 chemotherapy courses and thereafter maintenance therapy with either chemo-immune maintenance (Non-squamous NSClc) or sole immuno-maintenance therapy (Sqamous NScLC,SCLC). In clinical studies, control CTs (CT-Thorax and CT Abdomen/Becken) were then performed every 6 to 9 weeks in order to change therapy into second-line therapy if necessary.

Consensus-based recommendation modified 2024 Under a system therapy in stage IVA/B, response, adverse reactions and symptoms should be evaluated one month after the end of treatment by the patient's care team. The basis for this should be medical history, physical examination, CT-thorax/abdomen/basket and appropriate imaging procedures (MRI skull in case of suspicion of brain metastases) depending on the complaint image. Subsequently, established re-imaginations should be carried out at least every 3-6 weeks during ongoing maintenance therapy (NSCLC, SCLC). In patients under ongoing system therapy, CT checks should be made during the interval of 6 to 9 weeks. Here appropriate examination procedures should be performed for the timely detection of a progression of the disease and for the modification of system therapy.

However, by the fewer nurses, the incidence of peripheral surgery was significantly lower in terms of frequency and frequency. However, in the follow-up care carried out by nurses, there was a significantly better patient satisfaction, significantly less medical conceptions and significantly less imaging examinations. An additional post-care program performed by specially trained nurses is thus an alternative way to organise the follow up examinations easier. However, due to the above-mentioned substantial change in the primary system therapy concepts of NSCLC and SCLC, such possibilities are to be seen as supportive and not as alternative to follow-ups/follow-up. Moreover, serious differences between the individual health systems in the affected countries should be taken into account. Research needs Research needs in particular with regard to the following questions: a. After-care intensity (methods), here especially integration of low-dose CT after three or four years b.

Strong consensus-based Recommendation reviewed 2024 The decisions made in the thorax oncology tumor board should be guided by the valid guidelines. Deviating treatment decisions should be justified and documented in the tumor board protocol. Strong agreement consensus- based Recommendation examined 2024 Economic aspects of treatment should be incorporated into the treatment decision with comparable efficacy and spectrum of side effects. Strong consensus consensus-oriented Recommendation tested 2023 Clinical studies and resulting approvals often represent only a part of the patients to be treated. Therefore, according to the individual treatment situation, therapy modifications should be made to the benefit of the patient. Strong consent background In the treatment of lung carcinoma there is an increasing degree of individualisation based on new therapy options. Therefore every patient with newly diagnosed lung carcidoma should be introduced in a chest oncologic tumour board. This applies, for example, to the use of chronic generics, biosimilars, and therapies in which there is a significant difference in costs for comparable efficacy. Furthermore, patients with age and comorbidities may need to undergo a treatment modification. As a combination of demographic ageing as a shift in the age structure in favour of older people and the increase in the individual risk of disease with increasing age, there is an increasing incidence of age-related chronic diseases in an ageing population. In the most frequent localisations of malignant new formations (intestinal, lung, prostate, breast) the data from the Robert Koch Institute's Centre for Cancer Registers data show an increase in new diseases between 1999 and 2008. With the highest increase, women with lung carcinoma with an increase of 39% are affected here. However, demographic ageing in all localizations leads to a rise in the number of new diseases [1662]. With the increase of age, the risk of multimorbidity is also increasing. This is also shown by an analysis of the mean age of the Robert-Kochian population in 2012; however, the average age of one patient with a young population of about one year. In the sense of \"monopathology\", patients suffering from other chronic diseases are often excluded. On average, study patients are 10 years younger than the average patients with the respective disease. The transfer of these study results to older, often chronically ill and multimorbid patients is not scientifically substantiated, can even be very risky for the corresponding patients. In oncology, there are no special guidelines for older and multi morbid patients due to the poor evidence situation. Therefore, more and more experts demand evidence of the effectiveness and safety of new therapies in older and fragile patients. These evidence should definitely require regulatory authorities prior to the approval of new treatments. With the focus on geriatric cancer patients, completely new study questions are also posed, such as comparing different treatment strategies (including dose reduction and possibly exchange or omission of certain substances). For example, in the case of mammacarcinoma, the benefit of \"better chemotherapy compared to conventional chemotherapy\" in a study could be recommended in the context of a study on cancer, for example, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, for Onkria and for the International Society for Cancer. Therefore, the experts in the position paper also recommend smaller studies, possibly without a control group, in order to gain insights into efficacy and toxicity for more closely defined patient groups [1665]. As long as there are no corresponding studies and thus no evidence, the specialists are forced to make possible adjustments after sound justification in the sense of therapy modifications in favor of their elderly and co-morbid patients 16.6 Research needs are advanced in the thorax. © Guidelines.

Version 3.0 In stage IV NSCLC patients with radiological response or stabilisation and appropriate tolerability, maintenance therapy is not yet sufficiently clear after study-analogous cycles of platinum-containing chemo/immune therapy. The overall duration of chemotherapy or immuno-monotherapy in stage IV is still insufficient. The checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab and cemiplimab were administered in the pivotal studies over two years. A continuation of therapy beyond this interval can be offered to the patient with continued tumour control and toleration. Atezolizumab was not defined in the approval study as limiting the duration of therapy. Patients with NSClc stage IV with special risk factors for immunotherapy Patients with autoimmunes diseases and good general condition (ECOG 0-1) can be provided with immuno- (combination) therapy if the autoimune disease is not life-threatening and not active. Close monitoring is particularly necessary in such cases. Patients who have controlled hepatitis B or C or controlled HIV-EC (a good combination) can offer an immuno-combung-1. patients with controlled hepatitis B or C or controlled HIV disease and good general condition (ECOG 0-1) may be offered immuno- (combination) therapy. Close monitoring is particularly necessary in such cases. ie Stage IV and ECOG 0-1, which do not have therapeutic mutations and are not suitable for treatment with checkpoint inhibitors, should be offered 4- 6 cycles of platinum-based combination chemotherapy. The following regimens are recommended: carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin/carboplatine + paclitaxle, cisplatin/carbotlatin + vinorelbine, ciplatin / carbolatin + docetaxel; cispabine/carbollatin + gemcitabine.

(The pivotal study also allowed pemetreced to continue in maintenance once every 3 months if it is used as the combination partner for platinum in its first four cycles). NSCLC patients with non-plate epithelial cancer in stage IV and ECOG 2-3 or older patients ≥ 70 years can be offered in palliative initial line therapy regardless of PD- L1 status of monotherapy at the beginning of March. In this post-care plan, all those responsible in the inpatient and outpatient sector should be involved. The focus should be on the symptoms of patients. Psychooncology and social counselling should be included in the structured follow-up plan. 2010: Recommendation level D (missing or inconsistent studies, recommendation based on expert opinion) © Guide program Onkologi Version 3.0 * Cave: Off-label use After completion of multimodal therapy (Stadium I-IIIC, OMD), which includes a local ablative procedure (OP, RTx, CTx/RTx), a structured follow up plan should be developed for each patient. The structured after-care schedule should be designed to identify recidivities, secondary carcinomas, complications and toxicity of therapy and the need for psychooncological and social advice During a systemic therapy (stage IVA, IVB) a structured post-treatment plan should have been developed for every patient. Plan to identify progression/relapse, second carcinomas, complications and toxicities of therapy and the need for psychooncology, palliative medicine and social counselling. In patients after ablative local therapy (stage I-II and III surgery, radiotherapy/ radiation chemotherapy in stage I and II) posttherapeutic complications that may occur after surgery or radiotherapy should be recorded and treated. he ie (Weak recommendation) © Onk i n de. he Od C mal ierte grade kologi Version 3.0 Typically, this is done within 8 weeks of completion of local therapy. In patients with NSCLC in stage III after ablative local therapy (ray therapy/ray chemotherapy ), the posttherapeutic complications that may occur after radiotherapy should be recorded and treated. The first clinical presentation after completion of radiotherapy is to be carried out within 8 week. After locally ablactive therapy of the NSClc in stage 3, a CT thorax should be performed to exclude progression (in order to start using Durvalumab). After completion of multimodal therapy (including OP or CTx/RTx) patients should be examined quarterly (every 3 months), from the 3rd year half-yearly and included in a screening program after 5 years. These intervals begin with the initial presentation within 8 weeks of the completion of the therapy. At these follow-up appointments, a determined history, a physical examination and appropriate imaging procedures (X-rays Thorax, Sonography Abdomen or CT examinations) are to be performed. ie Thereafter, fixed re-introductions should be performed at least every 3 months. In patients with the option for further therapies, a reduction of the follow-up intervals to 6 to 8 weeks is useful. Here, appropriate examination procedures should be carried out for the timely detection of a progress of the disease. 2010: Degree of recommendation D (missing or inconsistent studies, recommendation based on expert opinion) © Guide program Onkologi Version 3.0 In high-risk patients (e.g. EGF-R+, ALK+, ROS-1+, adenocarcinomas with stage III) a skull MRI should be regularly performed according to the interdisciplinary treatment team. Under a system therapy at stage IVA/B, response, adverse reactions and symptoms should be evaluated one month after the end of t treatment by the patient's supervising team. The basis for this is anamnesis, physical examination, CT-thorax/abdomen/abs and, depending on the symptoms, appropriate imaging procedures (MRT skulls in case of suspicion of brain metastases) should be conducted at least 6 weeks. In patients undergoing ongoing system therapy, CT checks are useful over the course of 6 to 9 weeks. Here, appropriate examination procedures should be performed for the timely detection of a progression of the disease and for the modification of system therapy. ie and mortality rates: Absolute and relative survival rates up to 10 years after initial diagnosis, after ung 5: Relative 5-year survival after UICC stage (7th edition TNM) and sex, ung 6: Relative 5-annual survival 2012-2014 by histological type and gender, UNG 10: Algorithm for histologic typing and further processing of biopsy preparations and cytological preparations in case of suspicion of ung 19: Flowchart NSCLC IV with therapeutic driver mutations - ROS, BRAF, NTRK, RET, lung 20: Flow chart NSC LCD IV squamous cell carcinoma without therapeutic driver mutations ... 350 ung 21: Flow Chart NSCOC IV Non-plattene epithelium carcinomas without therapeutic option 20 Abbil Abbilu Abbilgu Abbildu Abfiltu Abbilation list 466 ung 22: Flow charts for the treatment of preoperatively secured small cell lung carcinoms 23 Thrap operatively for small cell therapy.",
