The treatment of the first and last months of the clinical trial has been in the treatment of patients in the first year of treatment.The treatment of chronic cancer has been the first of the following: the treatment in the second year of the treatment, the treatment is the first time that the treatment has been completed in the last year. The treatment is in the final phase of the course of treatment, and the treatment for the first month of the year has been during the first period of the previous treatment period. The chapter on drug treatment is the chapter that has also undergone the greatest changes in this revision. This revision includes a discussion on pre- and perioperative chemoimmune therapy in localised and locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer and a recommendation on treatment choices if such treatment is planned. Furthermore, the chapter on medicinal treatment in metastatic lung cancer has been updated with a current literature review of recommended indications for targeted treatment. The text on future treatments where indication is not yet available has been up-to-date. In light of the rapid development, it is worth noting that the care program recommends testing genetic changes in EGFR, BRAF, KRAS, ERBB2, MET, ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK as well as evaluation of PD-L1 expression with immunohistochemical analysis",

The care programme provides recommendations for how healthcare should be performed in order to meet these criteria. These recommendations should therefore be followed in essential parts so that it can be considered that healthcare lives up to the Health Act. The Patient Act (2014:821) states that healthcare provider must provide the patient with appropriate information on, inter alia, the diagnosis, possible alternatives to care, the risk of adverse reactions and expected waiting times, and information about the possibility of choosing between equivalent treatments (3 Chapter 1-2 § patient law). The Care provider must, according to this law, provide a permanent care contact and information on the possibility for a new medical assessment, including within another region. The healthcare provider should also inform about the ability to choose a healthcare provider throughout the country within the country in general and specialised care.",

Lung cancer is the 6th most common cancer in men and 4th most commonly in women, with prostate and breast cancer as the most common form of cancer in males and females respectively. The age-standardised incidence was 2022,37.1 x 10-5 among males and 47.5 x 10–5 among females. During the same period, however, more than 3,500 deaths due to lung cancer each year were reported to the Swedish Cause of Death Register [2]. However, the reports are different, not completely overlapping populations, and both records are likely to be associated with different types of reporting biases. It may be suspected, among other things, that clinically diagnosed cases of pulmonary cancer are underreported to the Cancer Register, and that the actual incidence exceeds the reported [3]. No, the less is generally poor. The expected relative 5 year survival after diagnosis is about 28 % in Sweden (24 % in men; 31 % in women) [1], making lung cancer-related causes in men as the highest, as well as in Sweden.",

The risk of suffering from lung cancer after exposure to radon are particularly high in smokers. • Congenital genetic factors are likely to contribute to an increased risk of lung disease in some of the population. Apart from rare genetic syndromes, knowledge of hereditary lung cancers is less than in diseases such as breast cancer and colorectal cancer. • Dietary factors are probably of some significance for the risk of developing lung cancer; a high intake of fruit and vegetables has been shown in epidemiological studies to reduce the risk for cancer, including lung cancer",

Most never-smokers (about 15 %) are in the group of adenocarcinomas. The proportion of never-smoking patients is higher among women with lung disease than among men. Never-smoke are also significantly more frequent among younger patients (< 40 years) with lung lung cancer. Odds Ratio (OR) for lung cancer in smokers and former smokers is reported in Table 3.1 [7, 8]. Table 3.1 Odd's Ratios (OR), for smokers and for former smokers (ORs) is also significantly higher in patients with cancer. Secondary prevention with a view to stopping smoking in all patients, regardless of what they are looking for, is therefore an urgent task for all healthcare professionals to reduce future lung cancer risk, as well as the risk of other tobacco-related diseases (see further chapter 4 Tobacco prevention). Passive smoking increases the risk for lung cancer by a factor of 1.2 and is estimated to cause about 25% of all lung cancer in never-smokers. Social measures against smoking in public environments should therefore be easy to justify, not only to prevent children and young people from starting smoking, but also to protect non-s smokers from a serious health risk.",

Asbestons, which is a collective name for various silicates, were widely used until 1976 when bans were introduced in Sweden. Particularly vulnerable occupational groups were isolaters, pipers and shipyard workers, but also construction workers, car repairers, port workers with several have sometimes had significant asbestos exposure. The late time between exposure and development of lung cancer may be long, and individuals with significant asbestos exposures in the 1970s are still at an increased risk of developing lung cancer. Today, exposure to asbestos is doubled compared to a non-exposed population (concerning historical Swedish conditions), and about 15 times higher in smokers than never-smokers. The connection between these factors can best be described as multiplikative. If the relative risk of lung lung cancer in asbestos-exposing individuals is doubled as compared to non-emerging population (indicating historical Swedish circumstances), and approximately 15 times greater in smokers, the relative risks of smoking are also higher.",

As with asbestos, there appears to be a synergistic relationship between ionising radiation and smoking and the risk for lung cancer; low dose exposure to radon daughters in homes can also lead to an increased risk of lung cancer formation. Based on Swedish case-control studies, however, it has been estimated that housing radon can be a contributing factor to 300-400 cases of lung lung cancer each year. The increased risk has only been established in smokers, which supports an assumption of synergy effect between ionising and smoking. However, exposure in homes is difficult to determine ex post, why the importance of residential radon as a risk factor is hard to quantify. Radon exposure in housing may be due to both building materials, e.g. blue concrete, and background radiation from rock. Good ventilation reduces exposure.",

Lung cancer can occur as a manifestation in other cancer syndromes, such as 2.5–6.8% of carriers of hereditary TP53 mutations adenocarcinoma in the lung at a young age [10]. These families are characterized by early breast cancer, sarcoma and brain tumours. It is also known that families with confirmed melanoma familiality may have mutations in the tumour supressorgia CDKN2A and they also have an increased potential for pancreatic cancer and other tobacco-related cancers such as lung cancer [11]. Therefore, other cancer diagnoses of the patient themselves or close relatives should always be requested and referred to oncogenic reception for assessment of suspected hereditary cancer. If a family exhibits lung cancer only in close relatives without obvious environmental factor, there is no known single cause. There are therefore no established control programmes for these families, but smoking cessation is recommended.",

Never-smoke tumours, which are almost always adenocarcinoma, have been suggested to have their own tumour biology with among other things lower rates of proliferation and with overall fewer changes in tumour genome. That lung cancer among never-smoking patients (in studies commonly defined as having smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in total) more often shows some of the tumor-driven mutations or gene fusions that enable treatment with targeted therapy have probably contributed to the increased awareness of this particular patient group in recent years. Although the number of never-Smokers with lung cancer has increased in absolute numbers during the time these data were recorded in the national lung cancer register (2002 and onwards), the proportion of never smoking among lung cancer cases would have been relatively unchanged (about 15% for women and 10% for men) during the same period [13].

After a few months, a gradual reduction of the dose is recommended, e.g. by switching to a weaker patch or chewing agent, or reducing the number of tablets, inhalations etc. A common error is that patients chew nicotine gum too quickly and thus swallow down nicotine before it is taken up into the oral mucosal.

However, the effects on lung cancer mortality could not be assessed in this study. In August 2011 The National Ling Screening trial (NLIST) was published, in which 5,454 persons were included and were randomised to either screening with low-dos-DT or conventional lung-pumping patients were found to be able to detect the effects of the lung mortality rate in this trial. on the reduction of the population's mortality rate of at least 10 %, and the reduction in the number of women in the population of the first year of death was the same as in the second year of age. In addition, the population population of adult patients in the population of Sweden is expected to reach a high risk of lung cancer in the first half of the year.This study includes 4099 subjects, including 2367 in the screening arm (1190 annual controls with LDCT and 1186 controlled every two years to 6 years) and 1723 in the control arm, aged over 49 years with a smoke exposure over 20 package years. Analysis of survival data at 10 years has shown 39% risk reduction for lung cancer mortality (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.39-0.95) and 58% risk reduction in lung cancer at 10 year control jf with 5 years control (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.22-0.79). The pooled results of several randomised studies, ff NLST and NELSON show that screening with low dose DT in a high-risk population can reduce the risk of cancer death, and justifies the introduction of lung lung cancer screening in Sweden. A dialogue between the Swedish lung cancer planning group and the Social Agency has been ongoing since 2019 regarding the inclusion of Lungcancer screening in Stockholm. In November 2022, a pilot project for lung cancer screening in Sweden (PLUS) was launched in September 2022. Around 1000 women aged 55-74 years received a survey sent home with questions concerning smoking names and those who met criteria for inclusion in LDCT screening was offered participation in the study. By November 2023, surveys were sent to nearly 27 000 women, 33% of them responded to surveys and 10% met screening criteria. 650 women have been screened with questions regarding smoking names, and the women who met the criteria for enrollment in LCDT screening were invited to participate in the survey.",

Furthermore, inhibition of sodium reabsorbability with polyuria and dehydration is observed. The clinical picture is dominated by CNS symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms and dehydration. CNS symptoms can simulate CNS metastasis, consisting of irritability, headache, drowsiness, somnolence, and, in pronounced cases, coma.

For example, testing for large cell neuroendocrine cancer in biopsy/cytology is recommended, and for patients who are never smoked and/or younger, clinicians usually want a molecular pathologic analysis regardless of the histological type of lung cancer. Similarly, a local routine governing what is appropriate action should usually be considered. Testing directly upon diagnosis (reflex testing in the pathology department), and in parallel with diagnostic additional analyses, is highly recommended for obtaining reasonable response and minimal tissue intake.

Several studies show that with modern radiotherapy the dose can be escalated further to 80-90 Gy with acceptable toxicity [126-128]. When co-administered with cytotoxics, normal tissue toxicity increases, but final doses of 74 Gy have been described in Phase II studies [129, 130]. This dose level is examined randomised and compared to 60 Gy in the noted study RTOG 0617 [108]. The 74 Gy group had worse treatment outcomes and this resulted in 60 Gy remaining standard in several directions. However, the results are re-discussed and end dose levels of 60 Gy may be insufficient, and against the background of published studies, a final dose of 66-68 Gy may also be considered well documented and safe even if randomised studies supporting this in part are missing. The Swedish PLANET study comparing conventional radiokemotherapy with individualised dose-scalated radiochemotherapy to a maximum of 84 Gy could be considered to be well documented as toxicity [131].

Conventional fractionation means that treatment is given by 2 Gy daily, corresponding to a dose of 10 Gy per week. By increasing the number of treatment fractions (hyperfraction) or shortening the total duration of treatment (accelerating), the effect can be enhanced by reducing the induction of DNA repair and tumour cell repopulation. In the case of non-small cell lung cancer, the UK CHART study early showed that an accelerated treatment with 1.5 Gy administered continuously three times daily to a final dose of 54 Gy resulted in better survival than conventional treatment by 2 Gym daily to the final dose 60 Gy [132]. A meta-analysis from 2012 in 10 studies, mainly conducted in the 1990s, found a small but significant benefit for accelerated or hyperfractionated treatment [133], but the lack of modern randomised studies involving chemotherapy allows evidence of accelerated treatment to be considered insufficient today.",

However, after completion of chemotherapy, it is important to follow the patient and consider re-introduction of chemotherapy in relapse (see below). Immunotherapy has recently shown promising results also in SCLC (see above) and can now be recommended in patients with spread disease and good general condition. There is no evidence to date that targeted drugs can improve survival in SCCL but extensive studies are ongoing in this area.",

The amount of fluid is small and the infusion time can be reduced. In the event of limited disease (equivalent to stage I-III), toracal radiation therapy is given as a complement to chemotherapy. Radiation therapy for torax should be given early and concomitant with chemotherapy if the patient is judged to tolerate this. For details and references, see chapter 13 Radiation therapy. In patients who achieve complete or good partial tumour emission and who do not have CNS metastasis, consideration should be taken to give prophylactic brain radiation (PCI). The prophylactic brain radiation should be administered after completion of chemotherapy.

Some studies advocate full disclosure and participation. While others seek all information while others do not want to know so much. The challenge is to provide information and at the same time manage the patient's hope and autonomy [335].

However from quality of life studies we know that compared to other cancer diseases, the highest levels of anxiety and depression are reported in patients with pulmonary cancer [337]. The disease involves a series of disease-related losses [338] worrying about the future [339] fear of worsening and becoming a burden for their relatives [340]. Unexpected symptoms create more stress and fatigue are the symptoms experienced most straining in everyday life [341]. Studies of how patients with Lung cancer reflect over and live in their everyday lives show that, after an initial period of the anxiety and despair described above, one tends to strive to live as usual [341].

Patients in the process of creating hopes can be perceived as being unrealisticly turned away with unrealistic expectations. A probable explanation, which should always be considered, however, is that it is about the patient's effort to maintain their self-image and create the opportunity to be present in life while it is going on. To avoid unnecessarily disrupting this process in the patient, it is valuable that as a caregiver you know how the hope-making process may seem to be, but also what notions of living close to death you yourself carry. In conclusion, healthcare professionals can make it easier for patients by: • preparing the patient for expected symptoms of illness and side effects of treatment. • Encourage contact nurse in case of new symptoms or troubles that you do not know again to quickly get an assessment and be able to avert unnecessary concern. • When the patient response is difficult.",

The place of surgeons in treatment is well established, while the evidence for other oncology treatments is weaker. Therefore, the current treatment recommendations should be seen as a pragmatic approach in a situation with limited scientific evidence. These conditions also justify the treatment of patients with bronchiocarcinoid and the need for oncological management other than surgery being handled on units with overall competence regarding neuroendocrine tumours.

The most important prognostic factor is radicality at surgery. If this is not achieved, most people consider post-operational radiotherapy to be standard. In a complete resection, however, the indication of adjuvant radiotherapy depends on tumor stage and WHO classification [413]. In radically operated patients at tumour stage 1 the relapse rate is so low (< 2 %) that the prognosis is hardly improved by PORT. In one single randomised study, no effect of PORT [382] was seen, so the treatment is not recommended today [414].

During the period 1977-1982, six regional oncology centres were set up at the initiative of the National Board of Health and Welfare. From 1984, a regional onkological centre in each healthcare region will be responsible for the control, coding and registration of cancer notifications submitted. Notification to the cancer register will be regulated in the National Agency for Health and Safety at Work (SOSFS 1984: 32). The notification will be made by the doctor responsible, on the one hand, and by the pathologist/cytologist responsible. The notification should include, as far as possible, the date of diagnosis, diagnostic method, morphological diagnosis, tumor location and tumour distribution (TNM status). Some regions started with the beginning of 1995 a more extensive registration, in so-called lung cancer quality registers, in cooperation with the regional oncologic centres. Since 2002 there has been a national quality register for lung cancer, the National lung cancer register (NLCR).",

Lung cancer association primarily addresses those who have received lung cancer, but also related people and others that think that work for better care, treatment, treatment and survival of lung cancer is important. Ling cancer association's vision is that no one should die in lung cancer! We also work to get rid of stigmatisation – everyone can suffer from lung cancer. We work for a fair and equal cancer care, for shorter waiting periods and for more research around lung cancers. An important goal is to become more members of the association. Patient association was started in 2004 with the aim of providing support to those who received lung lung cancer . For this reason, it was then named the support. After a number of years with small financial resources, the organisation had grown so that it met the requirements for financial support.",
