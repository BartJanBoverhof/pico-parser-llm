The risk of suffering from lung cancer after exposure to radon is particularly high in smokers. • Innate genetic factors probably contribute to an increased risk of lung cancer in a part of the population. Apart from rare genetic syndromes, knowledge of hereditary lung cancer is less than in diseases such as breast cancer and colorectal cancer. • Dietary factors are likely to have some significance for the risk of developing lung cancer.

Asbestos, a collective name for various silica, was widely used until 1976 when the ban was introduced in Sweden. Particularly vulnerable occupational groups were isolaters, pipers and shipyard workers, but also construction workers, car repairers, port workers with several have sometimes had significant asbestos exposure. The latency between exposure and development of lung cancer may be long, and individuals with significant asbestos exposure in the 1970s are still at increased risk of lung cancer. Today, asbestos exposure is associated with the demolition and renovation of older buildings and installations. The risk of lung cancer is significantly increased in the case of simultaneous asbestos exposure and smoking increase. The relationship between these factors can best be described as multiplicative. If the relative risk of lung cancer in asbestos-exposed individuals is doubled compared to a non-exposed population (concerning historical Swedish conditions), and approximately 15 times in historical Swedish conditions.",

As with asbestos, there seems to be a synergistic relationship between ionising radiation and smoking and the risk of lung cancer. Low dose exposure to radon daughters in homes can also increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Based on Swedish case-control studies, however, it has been estimated that housing radon can be a contributing factor to 300-400 cases of lung cancer each year. The increased risk has only been established in smokers, which supports an assumption of synergy between ionising radiation and smoking. However, exposure in homes is difficult to determine ex post, why the importance of residential radon as a risk factor is difficult to quantify. Radon exposure in homes may be due to both building materials, e.g. blue concrete, and background radiation from rock. Good ventilation reduces exposure.",

These families are characterized by early breast cancer, sarcoma and brain tumours. It is also known that families with confirmed melanomaity may have mutations in the tumour supressorgia CDKN2A and they also have an increased risk of pancreatic cancer and other tobacco-related cancers such as lung cancer [11]. Therefore, other cancer diagnoses of the patient themselves or close relatives should always be requested and referred to oncogenetic reception for assessment of suspected hereditary cancer.

At very high tobacco consumption, two patches may sometimes be needed. The chance of success is increased if patches are combined with slightly more fast-acting preparations such as chewing gum, tablet or spray [31]. After a few months, a gradual reduction of the dose is recommended, e.g. by switching to a weaker patch or chewing gum, or reducing the number of tablets, inhalations, etc. A common error is that patients chew nicotine gum too quickly and thus swallow down nicotine before it is taken up into the mucosa.

There is much to suggest that screening by early detection could be a good method of reducing the mortality of lung cancer [34]: • The disease has high morbidity and mortality. • It is a common tumour disease. • There is a dominant risk factor, i.e. smoking, which enables screening of a defined risk population. • Lung cancer is asymptomatic during a significant part of the course and curative therapy is asymptomatic.",

Furthermore, inhibition of sodium reabsorption with polyuria and dehydration is observed. The clinical picture is dominated by CNS symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms and dehydration. CNS symptoms can simulate CNS metastasis, and consist of irritability, headache, drowsiness, drowsiness, and in pronounced cases coma. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms are anorexia, nausea/ vomiting, obstipation and abdominal pain. Paramalign hypercalcaemia in lung cancer is a highly adverse prognosive factor.",

Single neurological syndromes are involved in general. Subacute peripheral neuropathy is the most characteristic neuropathy associated with small cell lung cancer, and may precede the diagnosis of cancer by several months.

In these cases, referral for work ECG or ergospirometrics as well as, if necessary, cardiology assessment. Thus, work tests do not need to be routinely performed in an an anamnestic cardiac fitness patient prior to lobectomi.

Patients with values of 10-20 ml/kg/min. are an intermediate group and where analysis of CO production in relation to minutial ventilation (VE/VCO slope) can be determined and provide additional guidance [65]. A recently published retrospective Swedish cohort study supports the use of ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2-slope) can improve risk stratification in the patient group with maximum oxygen uptake in the imtervallet of 10-20 ml/kg/min.

The limit of 22 metres in height shows a positive predictive value of 86% for predicting a VO peak of 15 ml/kg/min. [70].

However, predictive postoperative FEV % of normal value is a better value, as this takes into account age, gender and length. Prior to planned pulmectomy, ventilation/perfusion skintigraphy is recommended for calculating postoperative FEV . The reason is that there is not rarely a certain measure of mismatching between ventilation and perfusion, where ppoFEV value can become falsely low if only spirometry is used as basis for calculation.

Chemotherapy is the basic treatment principle for all patients with SCLC who are not terminal.

How individual patients interpret and manage their life situation depends on their socio-cultural and life-historical context. • In threatening situations, people instinctively seek a relationship with the person/body who can help, in the case of severe illness, healthcare is such a body.

The health care involves hope of cure or extended life time as well as hope of relief and comfort. It is therefore not only a medical helper but also a potentially safe harbor that connects to [329, 330].

Therefore, how to communicate and convey information has an essential importance.

Some studies advocate 中full disclosure. [332] while others provide other perspectives [333, 334]. Information can be both facilitating and aggravating depending on how it is adapted to the patient's current situation, desire and needs [330].

However, from quality of life studies we know that in comparison with other cancers, the highest levels of anxiety and depression are reported in patients with lung cancer [337]. The disease involves a series of disease-related losses [338] worrying about the future [339] fear of worsening and becoming a burden for their relatives [340]. Unexpected symptoms create more stress and fatigue are the symptoms experienced most straining in everyday life [341].

Unlike carcinoids of gastrointestinal origin, endocrine symptoms are uncommon (functional tumours), but occur and include carcinoid syndrome, atypical carcinoid syndrome and Cushing's syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is due to endocrine secretion of serotonin or other vasoactive products from the tumor, and is seen in 1–3% with flushing, diarrhoea, right-sided heart disease and asthma. Carcinoid syndrome usually requires liver metastasis, and occurs when endocrine products from the tumor do not break down into the liver but pass to the right heart. There is also an increased risk of plaque formation of the tricuspidalis and pulmonary valve. • Atypical carcinoid syndrome occurs as a result of increased histamine release from the tumor, with flushing, periorbital oedema, tear secretion, and diarrhoea.",

With DT, stage 4A (pleural dispersal) and 4B (extratorical dispersion) disease is detected, but the method is not considered to be sure to determine the degree of invasivity of local disease. Magnet resonance imaging (MR) rarely provides additional information in this respect. Sometimes echocardiography, pre- or perioperatively can be helpful in assessing the growth into adjacent organs. FDG-PET is not used routinely but can provide information in remote distribution. Generally speaking, it is significantly higher in B3 thymomoma and thymus carcinoma than in other thymomas [406].

The most important prognostic factor is radicality in surgery. If this is not achieved, most people consider post-operative radiotherapy to be standard. In a complete resection, however, the indication of adjuvant radiotherapy depends on tumour stage and WHO classification [413]. In radically operated patients at tumour stage 1 the relapse rate is so low (< 2%) that the prognosis is hardly improved by PORT.

The lung cancer association is primarily aimed at those who have received lung cancer, but also to relatives and others who think that work for improved care, treatment, treatment and survival of lung cancer is important. The lung cancer association's vision is that nobody should die in lung cancer! We also work to remove stigmatisation – everyone can suffer from lung cancer! We work for a fair and equal cancer care, for shorter waiting periods and for more research around lung cancer. An important goal is to become more members of the association. The patient association was founded in 2004 with the aim of providing support to those who have received cancer cancer.",

The risk of suffering from lung cancer after exposure to radon is particularly high in smokers. • Congenital genetic factors probably contribute to an increased risk of lung cancer in some of the population. Apart from rare genetic syndromes, knowledge of hereditary lung cancer is less than in diseases such as breast cancer and colorectal cancer. • Dietary factors are likely to have some significance for the risk of developing lung cancer. A high intake of fruit and vegetables has been shown in epidemiological studies to reduce the risk of cancer, including lung cancer. Row 2:",

Therefore, responsiveness to early symptoms is important. Those diagnosed before onset of symptoms have often done chest X-rays or computer tomography of torax with other issues. • Lack of symptoms in diagnosis means better prognosis. Therefore, it is important not to ignore a unclear pulmonary change, especially in smokers. • Symptoms of lung cancer may be local, regional or general.
