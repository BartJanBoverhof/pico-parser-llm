Lung cancer is a complicated matter, where decisions on investigation, treatment and care must base knowledge and understanding of the patient situation. Lung cancer is a complex case, where decisions on investigation, treatment and care must be based on background knowledge and understanding of the patient's situation. Therefore, Dokume contains both recommendations on investigation and treatment so far on fact-finding, and sections that are more of the textbook character of the program should not be seen as a cookbook, but as a framework docume on certain points requires regional or local concreteisation, e.g. what are the rat or method choices where several equivalent alternatives exist, and as regards Nisatory aspects of care that may differ between different regions of the rune are primarily doctors and nurses investigating and we nths with lung cancer, but the document can also be used as support for other staff categories that come into contact with the ntgruppen, and for medical teaching.

The first edition of the RCC in collaboration 1-08-25 Version 5.0 determined by RCC, in collaboration with the Regional Cancer Centre, is published but can be requested from Regional Cancer Center, info@cancercentrum.se. 1.2 Changes compared to the previous version The first version of the national lung cancer care programme was issued in 1991, with revised versions in 2001 and 2008. The current edition under mandate from RCC was first published in 2015. The care programme has since 2018 been updated annually. This version is a revision of version 7.1 defined Changes in version 8.0 of the health care programme have been made to the national treatment programme in the autumn of the year. The first issue of the clinical care programme for lung cancer was published in 1991 and 2008. The chapter on lung cancer screening has been revised in view of the ongoing discussion on the value of lung cancer screening in Sweden. Furthermore, all chapters concerning treatment recommendations have been updated. The three main chapters on treatment (surgery, radiotherapy and drug treatment) contain all major or minor changes compared to previous versions of the care programme. The chapter of the chapter on drug treatment in metastatic lung cancer has also been updated with a current literature review of recommended therapeutic indications for targeted treatment. The text on future treatments where indications are not yet available is updated. Against the background of the rapid development, it is worth noting that the care program recommends testing genetic changes in EGFR, BRAF, KRAS, ERBB2, ORD, ORDER, and ELVD, and expression of the ROS ROS.",

These recommendations should therefore be followed in essential parts so that it can be considered that healthcare lives up to the Health Act. The Patient Act (2014:821) states that healthcare provider must provide the patient with appropriate information on, inter alia, the diagnosis, possible alternatives to care, the risk of adverse reactions and expected waiting times, and information about the possibility of choosing between equivalent treatments (3 Chapter 1-2 § patient law). The Care provider must, according to this law, provide a permanent care contact and information on the possibility for a new medical assessment, including within another region.

The cases were relatively evenly distributed between the sexes with some obesity in women (54.8 % of cases). Lung cancer is the 6th most common cancer in men and 4th most commonly in women, with prostate and breast cancer as the most common form of cancer in males and females respectively.

During the same period, however, more than 3,500 deaths due to lung cancer each year were reported to the Swedish Cause of Death Register [2]. However, the reports are different, not completely overlapping populations, and both records are likely to be associated with different types of reporting biases. It may be suspected, among other things, that clinically diagnosed cases of pulmonary cancer are underreported to the Cancer Register, and that the actual incidence exceeds the reported [3]. No, the less is generally poor. The expected relative 5 year survival after diagnosis is about 28 % in Sweden (24 % in men; 31 % in women) [1], making lung cancer-related causes in men as the highest, as well as in Sweden.",

Isolated cases are reported in the ages of 20-30 years but only 0.6% are under 40 years of diagnosis. In age groups up to 79 years of age, lung cancer incidence is higher among women, while men are still overweight in the highest age groups. The prevalence of lung lung cancer in Sweden, i.e. the number of individuals living with the diagnosis at a given time, was stated at the end of 2021 to be 8,958 cases (males 3,666, female 5,292) if the diagnosis dates are counted 5 years back in time, and a total of 14,265 cases (men 5,667, female 8,598) undiscovered date of diagnosis [1].

Two of the major surgery factors of the lung cancer status, and the patient's age per year of choice, were also limited by age. Over a longer period of time, lung cancer prognosis has nevertheless improved. For patients diagnosed in the 1960s, the expected 5-year survival rate was < 5% and almost entirely limited to cases that could be operated on. In a Western Swedish population-based study of 3,285 consecutive lung cancer cases with diagnosis in the 1976-1985 period, the observed 5 year survival rate is 8.3 %. Today's long-term survival rate around 28% means in relative terms more than a threefold improvement in the long- term forecast over 50 years, but is in absolute terms less encouraging, especially as it is likely to be partly attributable to the increasing proportion of women with lung cancer. However, a proportion of the improved long-time survival rate can be attributed to therapeutic advances such as modern radiotherapy, while a broadening of chemotherapy and modern drug therapy has mainly affected 1-, 2- and 3 year survival in a favourable direction.

Smokers are at an increased risk of suffering from all the most common histopathological types of lung cancer. Especially strong is the relationship for squamous cell carcinoma and lung cancer; the majority of non-smokers (about 15%) are in the adenocarcinoma group. The proportion of never-s smokers is higher among women with lung lung cancer than among men. Never-stresses are also significantly more frequent among younger patients (< 40 years) with lung carcinoma. Odds Ratio (OR) for lung cancer in smokers and former smokers in men and women respectively are reported in Table 3.1 [7, 8].

The smoke also contains isotopes such as Po-210 and Pb-210 (alpha particles), resulting in an exposure to ionising radiation which in itself increases the risk of cancer. There is no evidence that smoking of filter cigarettes or In all patients, regardless of what they are looking for, it is therefore an urgent task for all health care professionals to reduce the future risk of lung cancer, as well as the risk of other tobacco-related diseases (see further chapter 4 Tobacco prevention). Passive smoking increases the risk for lung cancer by a factor of 1.2 and is estimated to cause about 25% of all lung cancer in never-smokers. Social measures against smoking in public environments should therefore be easy to justify, not only to prevent children and young people from starting smoking, but also to protect non-sparklers from a serious health risk.",

Particularly vulnerable occupational groups were insulators, pipers and shipyard workers, but also construction workers, car repairers, port workers with several have sometimes had significant asbestos exposure. The latency between exposure to and development of lung cancer may be long, and individuals with significant asbestos exposures in the 1970s are still at an increased risk of developing lung cancer. Today, exposure to asbestos in connection with demolition and renovation of older buildings and installations. The risk of lung lung cancer is significantly increased in the case of simultaneous asbestos exposure and smoking increase. The relationship between these factors can best be described as multiplicative. If the relative risk of Lung cancer in asbestos-exposed individuals is doubled compared to a non-expressed population (concerning historical Swedish conditions), and approximately 15 times higher in smokers than never-smokers, the relative risks of smoking are best described as being associated with exposure to the exposure of smokers to the volume of the smoker. Findings of other asbestos-related conditions such as pleuraplase or asbestososis support the correlation between asbestos exposure and current lung cancer. In this context, the association between asbestos exposures and the less commonly occurring tumour form is primarily malignant pleura mesothelioma. The tumor form primarily affects individuals with extensive asbestos exposure, and unlike lung cancer has no known etiological link with tobacco smoking. Other occupational factors with etiologic significance for lung cancer include chlorine methyl ether used in certain chemical industries, hexavalent chromium, arsenic occurring in the ore industry and in the manufacture of certain pesticides, nickel compounds and certain heavy metals, such as cadmium used in battery and paint production.",

As with asbestos, there appears to be a synergistic relationship between ionising radiation and smoking and the risk for lung cancer; low dose exposure to radon daughters in homes can also lead to an increased risk of lung cancer formation. Based on Swedish case-control studies, however, it has been estimated that housing radon can be a contributing factor to 300-400 cases of lung lung cancer each year. The increased risk has only been established in smokers, which supports an assumption of synergy effect between ionising and smoking. However, exposure in homes is difficult to determine ex post, why the importance of residential radon as a risk factor is hard to quantify. Radon exposure in housing may be due to both building materials, e.g. blue concrete, and background radiation from rock. Good ventilation reduces exposure.",

These families are characterized by early breast cancer, sarcoma and brain tumours. It is also known that families with confirmed melanoma familiality may have mutations in the tumour supressorgia CDKN2A and they also have an increased potential for pancreatic cancer and other tobacco-related cancers such as lung cancer [11]. Therefore, other cancer diagnoses of the patient themselves or close relatives should always be requested and referred to oncogenic reception for assessment of suspected hereditary cancer.

Doctors and other cancer care staff have great confidence and outstanding opportunities to raise the issue. There are medical reasons for systematically documenting tobacco use. Short issues can arouse interest and start a treatment process leading to smoking cessation. Carcinogens in tobacco smoke do not only function as tumour inducers, but can also contribute to the progression of tumour disease.

Continued smoking is associated with a significant increase in mortality (HR 2.94; CI 1.15-7.54) and relapse (HR 1.86; CI 1.01-3.41) at the early stage of non-small cell lung cancer.

Motivating call technology is appropriate. It avoids requirements and touch sticks, and instead tries to stimulate the inherent motivation. If it is practical, you can usefully support the partner and family around the patient for smoking stop.

Usually, a relatively high dose for about four weeks is recommended. The dose should be in parity with the patient's previous tobacco consumption. A person who smokes 20 cigarettes usually needs to start with the strongest kind of nicotine patches or chewing gum. At very high tobacco consumption, two patches may sometimes be needed. The chance of success is increased if patches are combined with slightly more fast-acting preparations such as chewing gum, tablet or spray [31]. After a few months, a gradual reduction of the dose is recommended, e.g. by switching to a weaker patch or chewing agent, or reducing the number of tablets, inhalations etc. A common error is that patients chew nicotine gum too quickly and thus swallow down nicotine before it is taken up into the oral mucosal. Side effects are related to the type of product used, eg. skin irritation of the patch and local irritation of oral mucosa from gum and tablets.

      "text": "Until August 2011, there were only cohort studies of low-dose DT screening, one of these, I-ELCAP, is a collaboration between 38 centres in five countries [38]. A total of 31,567 symptom-free subjects with a smoke exposure > 10 pack years were screened with a baseline DT, and 27,456 were followed by annual DT surveys. Positive findings that justified follow-up studies were noted in 13% of initial DT studies and in 5% of the follow-ups. A total 484 lung cancer cases were diagnosed, 412 of which were stage I, and 405 of these were detected in the initial study. The importance of this study was to demonstrate that it is possible to conduct DT-based screening on a large scale and that low dose DT detects more tumours than with conventional lung X-rays. However, the effects on lung cancer mortality could not be assessed in this study. In August 2011 the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) was published as possible to perform DT based screening on low dose and that with either low-dos-DT screening were detected to either more tumors than with the conventional lung. The relative risk reduction for lung cancer mortality was 20 % if the low dose DT was used as a screening method compared to conventional chest X-rays, and overall mortality was reduced by 6,7 %. Based on the results in NLST, the American Society for Thoracic Surgery has presented guidelines for screening recommended for early detection of lung cancer [39]. The study has attracted considerable attention, and has resulted in the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) having carried out a workshop on lung cancer screening [40]. It was concluded that data from NLST are valid, but that significant issues remain to be highlighted before possible lung cancer testing can be implemented on a large scale internationally. Such issues include: • identifying the population with the best benefit of screening • investigating the cost effectiveness of DT screening • harmonising DT screening protocols regarding execution and volumetrical analysis • defining the value of follow-up techniques, standardising performance and defining the optimal surgery for screening noduli • defining of screening rates for both screening positive and negative findings • investigating cost-effectiveness of DTT screening • harmonizing DT-screening • harmonicising DT monitoring protocols for implementation and volidating projects. In another project – PLCO Screening Trial – criteria for the selection of the study population were validated and compared with NLSLT [41]. The selection of PLCO participants was based on a variety of factors such as age, race/ethnicity, educational level, BMI, presence of COPD, previous cancer, lung cancer in the family and smoking exposure. With this screening selection, the sensitivity was 83% in PLCO compared to 71% in NLST, and the positive predictive value increased from 3.4% to no reduction in specificity. NLST authors have also included in a screening review article [42] concluded that there is synergy between screening and smoking cessation measures. Thus, there is a need to better define the population, frequency of studies and to improve methods of discriminating between benign and potentially malignant findings. In January 2020, the main Nelson study, which was carried out in the Netherlands and Belgium [43]. In the period 2003-2006, 15 789 individuals (13 195 men, 2 594 women) were included in the period of age, and to enhance methods of discrimination between benign or low-dose treatment were published in the following years. Cumulative relative risk of death in lung cancer was 0.76 (0.61-0.94; p = 0.01) in the screening group compared to the control group. In women, the relative risk for lung cancer death was 0.67 (0.38-1.14). Thus, the results show a reduction in mortality risk equivalent to 24% in men and suggest an even greater risk reduction in women. Also, long-term survival data from an Italian screening study MILD published in 2019 [44] support a positive effect of screening with LDCT on reduction of lung cancer mortality. In this study, 4099 subjects including 2367 in screening arm (1190 annual controls with LCDT and 1186 controlled every two years to 6 years) and 1723 in control arm, aged over 49 years with a smoke exposure over 20 years. Survival data analysis at 10 years has shown 39% risk reduction for lung lung cancer morbidity (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.39-0.95) and 58% risk reduction of pulmonary cancer mortality at 10 year control jf with 5 years of control. Analysis of survival data at 10-years has shown a 39% reduction in the risk reduction rate of lung lung lung tumour mortality (HR 0.22-0.7). A study synopsis for the national introduction of lung cancer screening has been written by the lung cancer planning group in Sweden and presented to SoS June 2021. Based on data from existing studies, it is proposed that low dose DT within lung cancer screening programmes should be carried out at the start and every two years thereafter until the age of 74 years or lung cancer diagnosis. Screening should be completed if it has passed 20 years after smoking stoppage but at least 3 checks should be offered to these people, which should also apply to those aged 74 years under the screening programme. Smoking cessation programs should be provided to all active smokers. A screening biobank for collection of blood/plasma from the screened population should be created. By sending questionnaires to approximately 3 million individuals aged 50-74 years and with estimated response rates of 30% and estimated compliance with screening criteria among 12%, this would mean approximately 37 500 screening rounds per year nationally. The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare will not question the scientific evidence describing the benefits of lung lung cancer screens. However, the evidence for lung cancerscreening does not meet the criteria for continued screening of a general recommendation on screening mainly due to a screening population by a lifestyle factor, SoS calls for the Swedish population. For example, in the RCC Stockholm-Gotland, a pilot project for lung cancer screening in Sweden (PLUS) was launched in September 2022. Around 1,000 women aged 55-74 years received a survey home with questions related to smoking names and those meeting criteria for inclusion in LDCT screening were invited to participate in the study. By November 2023, surveys were sent to nearly 27,000 women, 33% of them responded to surveys and 10% met screening criteria. 650 women have been screened by November 20-23 and 6% have been referred to the Lungonkological Centre for investigation and 11% planned for LDCt survey to be sent to almost 27 000 women, 33 % of them answered questionnaires and 10% of them fulfilled screening criteria; 650 women were screened to November 2033 and 6% of these have been submitted to Lung oncology Centre for assessment and 11% have been scheduled for LDDT study group co-operation. The aim is to screen 1000 people in each region for 2 years. The inclusion should be based on the same criteria as in the planning group's study synopsis. People should be called from different socio-economic areas according to the Central Statistical Office's Geography Database (Reg So) and the project should be combined with smoking cessation measures.",

Peroperatively, it may also be considered with freezing sections from the tumor for confirmation of malignancy or for examination of distribution or radicality. In the investigation of suspected lung cancer, there is a large number of malignant patients being diagnosed with no important information on remissional analysis. Good anamnestic information on the referral and multidisciplinary working methods is important. Supplementary analyses have in most cases no value to distinguish reactive changes from highly differentiated cancers. Re-sampling should always be considered in unclear cases.

Another way is a rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) in which the tester himself, togologists or cytodiagnoses in connection with sampling assess et, aliquots the sample and make a preliminary assessment of representativeness possible diagnosis. 1 Cytologie of cytotoxic material must be controlled to some extent by local procedures such as those developed by samplers and pathology department when analyses (such as unhistoric staining) sometimes need to be optimised according to the type of ng/preparation, and when technical possibilities and habit of working with different settlements can be distinguished between different pathogens. Hank's solution is another liquid that is well for flow cytometry, which is recommended in case of requisition. The cytology material can also be added to the saline (PBS rar also for flowcytometry), normosmolar BSA or formalin.

For combined tumours, the tumour is classified as adenoscence mice if it consists of ≥ 10 % of each adenocorcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Correspondingly, the tumor is classified a pleomorphic cancer if it is composed of ≥10 % spool cell or giant cell carcinomas. Note that the safe diagnosis of these combined tumours can only be made on resectate – in biopsy/cytology, cancer is classified with sarcomatoid features according to immune histochemistry in: NSCLC likely adenokarcinom, NSCCLC likely squamed cell carcinoma or NSCAC (see also Table 8.1 above). In case of combined tumour with small cell cancer or large cell neuroendocrine, the cancer is also classified as a subtype of these forms, i. Positive TTF-1 and napsin A, in addition to adenocarcinoma, also for lung origin, are therefore often of value even in a clear morphological picture. Positive TTP-1 is also seen in thyroid cancer, some cases of neuroendocrine tumor (from high grade incl. of other origin) and isolated cases of adenocorcinoma of other source. Positive napsine A is also observed in many cases of renal cancer and in clear cell cancer of other backgrounds. In low differentiated non-small cell cancer with image suggestive of squamous epithelial differentiation, immune dyeing is performed to determine whether squamified cell carcinoma (only CK5/p40-positive), adenosquamous cancer (variable populations CK5-p40 and TTF-1/napsin A-positive respectively) or pseudosquammous adenocotomy (only TTF/1napsine A positive), adnoscial cancer (different populations CC5-P40- and TFT-1/napsinA positive) is not indicated in the presence of a clinical population without a clinical pattern. In case of only lepidonic plant pattern without an invasion in a biopsy, however, it should be stated that invasion cannot be excluded because pure in situ growth is very rare. Invasion is defined as a plant pattern other than lepidonic, stroma with myofibroblasts with invasion, vascular or pleural invasion and dispersion via airspace (STAS). Minimal invading adenocarcinoma (MIA) is defined by a ≤ 3 cm adenoccarcinomas with lepidian plant pattern with a total of ≤ 5 mm invasion and no invasion into vascular/pleural, necrosis or dispersion through airspace (STAS).

The tumors are monomorphous and have neuroendokrint plant pattern (see above) and associated immunohistochemical profile. Spol cell elements are not uncommon, especially in peripheral tumours, and may in technical artifacts complicate the morphological assessment. Typical carcinoides exhibit by definition < 2 mitoses per 2 mm2 and no necroses, while atypical carcines have 2-10 mitosis per 2mm2 and/or necrosiss. Using the proliferation index in Ki67 staining is a way to divide low/medium and high grade neuroentocrine tumors in the GItract, but do not define typical/atypical carcinoma of the lung. There is no evidence that Ki67 would provide better gradation of lung carcinomas, whereas Ki67 is usually beneficial to high-grade neurophology. In addition, the Ki67 index may have predictive relevance, especially in the case of metastatic disease for the choice of drug therapy and nuclear medicine therapy. 8.5 Treatment predictive molecular pathology analyses The indication for targeted therapy includes advanced non-small cell lung cancer with activating mutation in EGFR (point mutation or deletion in some domains), BRAF (V600), KRAS (G12C), MET (exon 14-scoping) and soon ERBB2 as well as genre arrangements/translocation of ALK (often inversion and fusion with EML4), ROS1 (ofever fusion with CD74, but several other partners are present), RET or NTRK. The indication of immunomodulatory therapy with PD-1 or PD-L1 medicinal products includes advanced NSCLC (oft-inversion and merger with EMBL4), ROS1 (very fusion with cd74, however several other parties occur), RET or NTPK. Indication for immunomodulation therapy with PPD1 or PD1 medicinal product, advanced noncancerous cell lung therapy is also recommended for the use of a high dose regimen. EGFR mutation and immunotherapy at high PD-L1 expression (and lack of EGFR mutation and ALK fusion) are also used adjuvant after surgery, so molecular pathology testing is also timely at an early stage. There is scientific evidence and clinical experience of detecting molecular genetic changes on both cytological and histological materials, while the evidence is still slightly limited for immunohistochemistry for PD- L1 on cytology. Local validation of predictive assays (both immune staining as well as FISH and sequencing) is recommended for cytologi as processing of the material may differ between sections and it may affect quality. There are various methods for detecting EGFR mutations, such as massive parallel sequence/NGS (next generation sequential) and PCR-based methods. Immunohistochemical staining and FISH have previously been tested as alternative methods for EGFR analysis, but are not treatment-founded and therefore generearrangements/translocation can be detected with FISH, immunohistoric staining, NGS (often generation sequential), and PCC based methods. For ALK, immunohistochemistry alone is sufficient for detection (with complementary FISH or other method only in case of non-conclusive outcome). Experience from e.g. NordiQC's external quality control programme (Run39, 2013) has shown difficulties in optimal detection of ALK in lung adenocarcinoma with clone ALK1 compared to clone D5F3 and 5A4, where the former is available as CE-IVD-labelled kit and is therefore recommended. For ROS1 (clon SP384 or D4D6, where the first is available in studies for the various medicinal products concerned, with different antibody clones tested on partly different platforms and with different cutoff levels for positive testing. At least 100 odible tumour cells are recommended regardless of test. Clonal 28-8, 22C3 and SP263 are available as the CE-ValD-marked Kit, which are available according to the comparator studies, with various antibody crayons that are tested on partially different platforms, and with various cutoff levels of positive test. This also allows the choice of antibody that is tested on the platform (in accordance with CE-IVD marking) available in the individual pathology department. However, Klon SP142 (linked to athezolizumab in a non-adjuvant situation) differs from the other mentioned and cannot be replaced by any other clone. This means that if testing is desired specifically for atezolizumab (non-adjunct treatment) then SP142) should be used. This test also includes evaluation of tumour-associated immune cells (which cannot be evaluated in cytologic tests). Generally, testing of all non-small cell lung cancer is recommended. The inclusion criteria for testing on biopsy and cytology should generally be generous due to the possibility of sample rate in heterogeneous tumours and diagnostic uncertainty. For example, testing in the picture of large cell neuroendocrine cancer is advised on biopsy/cytology. As a rule, otherwise, neuroendocrine tumours or cancer of the spot gland should not be tested for safe diagnosis. For a patient considered suitable for targeted therapy, a new sample should usually be considered. Testing directly upon diagnosis (reflexion testing in the pathology department), and primarily in parallel with diagnostic additional analyses, is strongly recommended to obtain reasonable response times and minimal tissue exposure. Testing should be carried out at initial diagnosis but also repeated at progression, relapse or metastasis if the patient has received systemic therapy, especially if targeted therapy is given. Treatment pressures often result in clonic evolution and selection within the tumour with the emergence of resistance to primary therapy. Finding resistance factors (if necessary with extended resistance panel) can allow a new target-controlled treatment to be selected. Based on current treatment strategy and drug indications (especially when several topical drugs are approved in the first line) and ongoing studies should include at least EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, MET, ERBB2, ALK, ROS1, RET, NTRK and PD-L1, it is unusual that treatment with untreated lung tumours have been authorised in the signal system (the MAP pathway) and current studies should cover at least EGFR, BRAV, MEAT, ALK2, AlK, ROS1, RAT, RET1, NTR, NT and PD1. It is also recommended that multiplexes such as NGS are reduced radically and a few incisions from a representative middle needle biopsy are often sufficient for all analyses. Furthermore, response times can be reasonable as five working days are sufficient for most available techniques. In the next generation of NGS panels (the GMS) such a panel has been validated (the GMS560) and implemented nationally via the country's molecular pathology laboratories under 8.6 Microscopy evaluation of neoadjuvant treatment In neoadvovant treated tumor, the entire tumour should be embed with the largest measure ≤3 cm, otherwise be embedding at least 1 bit from the tumor. is greater than that a completely central incision (at maximum tumor diameter) from the tumour will fit into a regular cassette or if it is deemed necessary to determine with certainty the tumour size, extent or other findings affecting stage/handing.

According to the national quality register, approximately 60% of patients are evaluated with PET-DT, and use is relatively similar throughout the country. However, in some cases symptoms and alarming findings of the chest X-ray may lead to an initial examination with PET DT where DT is performed with diagnostic quality. However the maximum diameter of the suspected tumor should be indicated, rounded to the whole mm. Additional pulmonary changes suspected of malignancy, such as growth in mediastinum, pleural, pericardium or torax wall, are noted in the response. Short axis measurement indicates mm and the appearance is assessed. Preserved fat hilus is often a benign sign. Position of metastasis suspect glands, abnormal size or appearance is indicated for N-classification. Maligite suspected changes in counterlateral lung skeleton, parenchymatous organs in upper abdominal, skeletal and possibly pleural and pericardial fluid are noted in the response and used to indicate correct M-classifiers. Lymph node metastases are more common if the tumor is solid and/or centrally growing [56]. In patients without enlarged lymph nodes in mediastinum, lymph nodemetastasis is found in about 20 % of cases and enlarged lymph nodes may also be benign. DT as the only examination has consequently too low sensitivity and specificity for a safe assessment of N-stage. If mediastine metastasized is crucial for the treatment decision, DT should be supplemented with PET-DT and possibly invasive diagnostics (see section 9.7 Mediastinal stadium). PET-DT therefore has a high sensitivity and negative predictive value, so that the mediascantivity of the renal glands is not a negative difference in the risk of the treatment decisions.",

(See section 19.1. Carcinoids) Radiological changes with unclear pathological significance are often detected in the liver. Furthermore, radiological characterisation of such changes can be performed by MRI, ultrasound or DT examination. The methods of examination have different pros and cons. What method is best suited in the individual case depends, for example, on the location of the change, size, appearance of the DT, the patient's renal function, the availability of the examination methods, and can be discussed with a radiologist. Further investigations of enlarged adrenal glands are performed according to local routines. Binjure changes are well-rounded or unbounded, and are best suited to the individual cases due to e.g. the location, size of the lesion of the DNA, the renal function of the scan, etc. If high uptake by PET-DT can be falsely positive, even benign barcadenomas may be highly absorbed. If the adrenal disorder does not have elevated FDG uptake, this is often true negative due to high negative predictive value (NPV) of the method. The adrenal gland can also be sampled via EUS to verify possible spread. MRI is a sensitive method for evaluating skeletal changes. Together with the appearance of DT, it is often possible to evaluate the probability of possible metastasis. PET-DT is also a good method for detecting bone metastases due to the frequent elevated FDG uptake in metastasias [57]. DT brain with contrast media (and skeletal algorithm) should be performed in the primary investigation at non-small cell lung cancer stage III prior to decision on curative radiochemotherapy, in individuals with proven tumour-induced mutations, and should already be considered in the initial investigation of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). If DT brains with contrast agents are not conclusive, MRTs should be carried out. In patients with advanced brain metastaminosis, a 10 % is achieved in patients. MRI has higher sensitivity to detect small brain metastases and leptomingeal carcinomatosis, and should be chosen if detection of these is critical for management. Findings of solitary or single brain metastatics on DT should be verified with MRI, when surgery or stereotactic radiation therapy of the metastasis may be considered if spread is limited. MRI is also valuable in the mapping of Pancoast tumors, and in the case of neurologic symptoms that indicate suspected spinal canal incubation or nerve root disorders (see Chapter 7 Symptoms and clinical findings) [58].",

TBNA can be performed in some cases without EBUS, e.g. in indirect tumour findings without endobronchial breakthrough (central tumour compression), and in case of findings of major lymph nodes on DT or PET-DT, in particular subcarinal. EBus-TBN is performed with a special bronchoscope with ultrasound probe and needle system for real-time puncture monitoring. The examination is usually carried out in the same way as ordinary bronchoscopy. According to the national quality register, more than 20 % of patients diagnosed with lung cancer are undergoing an EBS. Access to EBUS varies across the country, where the EBUUS frequency according to the quality register is highest in the south, south-east and north region. Usually, it starts with regular bronchoscopicology to inspect the airways and apply local anaesthetics, then the same seans should perform the EBS = cytological examination. In cytologic sampling, if possible, cytodiagnoses should be present to assess the representativeness of the sample (ROSE = rapid on site examination). EBUS is a tool that can be used in different ways. Firstly, a diagnostic EBUs can be made where material is taken from parabronchial glands with the purpose of performing histological diagnostics including molecular pathology testing. Second, EBus is made in single PET positive glands, e.g. in N2 or N3position, in order to verify the presence of malignant cells prior to treatment decisions on e. g. surgery. In this case, EBUS was used as a targeted stagnation, i.e. directed against a limited number of pre-radiologically mapped lymph node sites. Third, EBS is recommended for stagnating in its strict sense, according to ESMO guidelines (see fig. 9.2) for cytological/PAD verification of lymph nodes in mediastinum [62].

In these cases, EBS is directed against the mediatinal N2-/N3 glands that are radiologically/metabolt is not abnormal, but can be visualized by ultrasound (see figure 9.2). The aim of EBUSE for stroke is to control whether there is, despite negative radiology, still spread to mediatinous lymph nodes which could affect the treatment decision. In the event of successful outcome, the patient will need only a diagnostic procedure. Complications to sampling in bronchoscopy/EBUS include primarily bleeding. Fatal bleeding is described after biopsy of centrally located tumours. Mediastinitis is an unusual but serious complication of EBUS/EUS. In the case of symptoms such as fever, chest pain or malaise in a patient who has recently been tested for mediatinal sampling, mediatinitis should be considered. In addition to peripheral tumour transbronchial biopsies, there is also a risk of bleeding for pneumotorax. It is important to train the combination of EBS and EUS under calm conditions as a bronchoscope and balloon tamponad as a means of mastering unexpected bleeding complications. In isolated cases, air embolisms have occurred that may require pressure chamber treatment.

Changes in the latest version include a more fine-tuned classification of the size of the primary tumour up to 5 cm, an upgrade of the T-status of tumors over 5 cm (from T2b to T3) and 7 cm ( from T3 to T4), upgrading of T-Status at overgrowth on diaphragm (from the T3 through T4) and simplifying T-classification at tumour growth in main bronchial (T2 regardless of distance to Carina), simplification of T classification at athelectas (T2) regardless of extent), overgrowth at mediastinal pleura removal as Tclasscriterium, and a breakdown of extratoracal remote metastasis between M1b (oligometastasis) and M1c (multiple remote metastatics).

Since the previous version (7th edition), small cell lung cancer is also covered by the TNF classification, the 8th edition of which is summarised in the table below and the figure below. A simplified stadium classification system was previously applied, distinguishing between limited disease (Limited disease, LD) and widespread disease (extensive disease, ED). The basic condition of this system was that the tumour distribution at LD should be housed in a tolerable radiation field, i.e. limited to a lung, mediastinum and supraclavicular lymph nodes (the definition of ipsi or bilateral supraclavular metastases has varied). Limited disease (LD) is now equivalent to in existing systems of T1-4 N0-3 M0, with the exception of T3-4 caused by multiple lung nodules which do not fit in a tolerated radiation field. Disordered disease (ED) is nowadays all-metastatic disease (M1a/b) and T3-04 caused by multiple lung metastasis.

In T1/T2 tumours with resectable N2 disorder, i.e. preoperatively detected metastasis in single detachable, resectable lymph nodes in the N2 position (not subcarinal) without periglandular growth, surgery can be considered as first-hand treatment as a component of a multimodal treatment strategy.

However, in the event of multiple non-determinable glandable glandative surgery is not considered. where possible lymph node spread outside the lung has been most likely excluded, surgery may be considered if the ingrowth is limited and considered to be radically resectable as well as if surgery is part of a multimodal treatment strategy.

In the case of greater accessibility, a larger posterolateral incision has sometimes been used. Minimal invasive surgical technique, so called VATS surgery (Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery), has developed very rapidly in recent years and has been widely spread and accepted, including in Sweden. Several non-randomized studies preferably in patients with stage I disease – comparing the tumour resection via VATS with conventional technology have been published, and meta-analysis has also shown a slightly shorter rate of drainage treatment, a little short total time of care, less bleeding and significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative pneumonia for patients who are operated with VATS [85-87]. The pain and the need for painkillers in the early post-operative stage has also been less for patients undergoing treatment with VAT, even in most of the studies, including the same chronic long-term pain problems, for the two different interventions. The above meta-analyses, based on non-randomised material, have shown a meta-destination of approximately 5 percentage points for 5-year survival of VATS operated [86]. At WCLC 2019 in Barcelona, preliminary results from the first comparative randomised study with long-term results from China, designed as a non-inferiority study [89]. No significant difference in survival between VATS and open-label surgery were detected, either in terms of cancer-specific or overall survival. All in all, VATS is considered today – despite the absence of published randomised prognosis and long- term survival studies – to be a fully adequate (non-interior) alternative to open-to-racotomy in small peripheral Thumbs with no signs of spread (stage I), with significantly reduced pain directly post-operatively and shorter duration of drainage and care. One of the concerns with VATS based on most published studies could be a tendency to decreased lymph node replacement in this type of surgery and whether this could have any effect on long-time survival. Therefore, long-Terms are still awaited from, among others, a Danish randomised study and the above mentioned VIOLET study [88, 90].

The risk of surgery is relatively low with the -day mortality of more than 0.5 % in Sweden today [91]. Bilobectomy may occur in the case of right-sided tumour overgrowth on adjacent lobe or enema of intermediate bronchi. ectomy is performed in the event of overgrowth of all lobes in a lung, or in the presence of central rhage involving the main broncho, pulmonary artery stem or central erfluent. pulmectomy is a straining procedure and carries an increased risk of erythema and postoperative complications, including surgical mortality, herb with lobectomies.

European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) guidelines from 2006 recommend systematic lymph nodal dissection as the standard method for achieving complete tumour resection [96]. In several review articles, including a Cochrane analysis from 2010, there is also a trend towards better survival for patients who have undergone lymph nocturnal dissection, especially among patients with more advanced stages [97]. The large North American randomised ACOSOG Z0030 study from 2011 showed no difference in survival [98].",

In addition, an increased incidence of perioperative morbidity in the form of bleeding, lymph leakage, etc. associated with a more complete lymph nodal dissection is reported. Against the above ambiguous background, a systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph nome ampling is generally a minimum requirement for peri-operative lymph nocturnal explosion in surgery treatment of lung cancer in Sweden. This is defined on the basis of ESTS guidelines from 2007 as sampling from at least 6 lymph nodule sites, including 3 mediastine and always including station 7 (subcarinal).

Atelectases with complicated pneumonia due to immobilisation or securitisation are probably the most common complication following lung surgery. Postoperative mobilisation and breathing training with, among other things, PEEP-pipe are important preventive elements. In case of more severe securition, bronchoscopic cleansing can be effective. Post-operative arrhythmias (usually atrial fibrillation) occur in 3-30% of all patients operated. Prophylactic digitisation or beta-blocked were previously a standard method, but in the absence of evidence of efficacy, antiarrhythmic treatment is recommended today when the problem occurs. Lobär torsion with risk of pulmonary infarction and gangrene occurs most commonly in the midlobe and if fisure is complete. The diagnosis is usually made at daytime. Post-operative air leakage from alveolar wound surfaces is common, but usually heals within a week of conservative treatment (pleuradranage and respiratory clearance). In isolated cases, re-operation is required. Post-operational bleeding requiring re-optimisation is seen in 1-2% of the surgical cases. Bleeding can come from both resection and lymph node sites as well as intercostal artery and chest wall. Blood loss > 200 ml/h during the first hours after surgery usually justifies reexploration. Broncopleural fistula is today an unusual but still feared complication associated with high degrees of morbidity but also mortality. The complication occurs primarily in malnutrized, infected patients after induction treatment with chemo and/or radiotherapy. It is also more common in connection with pulmectomy and especially on the right side, since the complications occur mainly in male, infected subjects following induction therapy with chemo or radiotherapy, and is more common with polmectomy.",

Treatment is appropriately fractionated with 15 Gy x 3. • Adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered after SBRT for patients with T2 tumour. Standard therapy for patients who have locally limited tumour disease at stage I or II is surgery. Patients who are considered as medically inoperable, have increased surgical risk or do not desire surgery become eligible for curative radiation therapy. In Sweden, since the mid-1990s, stereotactic radiation therapy, SBRI (Stereotactic Body RadioTherapy), which is given for a short period of time with high fraction doses, has been offered in a significantly increased tumour control (88-90% at five years) in published studies [109-115]. The reported adverse reactions are mild. Over-experienceduring data have been more difficult to understand as patients die from non-cancer-related diseases. There was also some imbalance between SBRT and conventional hypofractionated radiation therapy in terms of survival but numerically improved local control [117]. The CHISEL study also reported that SBRI produced better local control and survival than conventional fractionated radiation treatment, but a proportion of the patients in the comparator group received relatively low radiation dose of 50 Gy [118]. Conventional fractional radiation therapy should no longer be given to patients with T1-T2N0M0. Different fractionation patterns have been used internationally, but in Sweden 15 Gy is given in three fractions to 45 Gy for one week most used. The Swedish experience is based on the use of inhromogenic dose distribution, where the dose per fraction in the periphery of the treatment area is 15 Gy and the dose centrally can amount to 22 Gy. Three fractions given every other day corresponds to biological doses over 100 Gy given with conventional fractionation. Tumours suitable for this treatment should be locally limited and peripherally located and not be close to a risk organ (esagus, heart or bronchia in the treatment region). Centrally located tumours of the lung can be treated with a slightly lower fractional dose, and a Phase II study (HILUS) for central tumours has been conducted in Scandinavia at a dosage of 7 Gy x 8 to 56 Gy [116].

However, there is clear evidence that pre-operative radiokemotherapy produces a higher response in N2 glands compared to chemotherapy alone, and that the proportion of patients who can be operated on with R0 resection increases [160, 162]. There is a meta-analysis that concludes that there are N2 patients who should receive pre-operational radiochemomatherapy and subsequently undergo surgery [163]. The pharmaceutical chapter also describes other pre- operative therapy with a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy [81], which shows survival gain compared to pre-conferential chemotherapy but the treatment is not compared with preoperative radiochemology.

      "text": "Activated EGFR mutations are demonstrated in 10-15% of all patients with NSCLC, and mainly in adenocarcinoma. Patients with activating mutations in EGFR should be offered treatment with an EGFR-TKI. In randomised studies, there have been longer progression-free survival (PFS) compared to conventional cytotoxic therapy in previously untreated patients [211], while overall survival (OS) has not been prolonged, likely due to a significant cross-over, with many patients receiving primary cytostatic therapy at a later stage receiving EGFR TK, there are likely to be no significant differences in efficacy between these three prepara even if direct comparative studies are few. Afatinib has been associated in a randomised phase IIB study (LUX-Lung 7) with a moderate prolonged PFS in comparison to gefitinib. The study did not include patients with CNS metastases. Osimertinib, a 3rd generation EGFR-TKI, was first introduced for relapse treatment failure of 1nd/2nd generation EGFL-TQI and demonstrated resistance mutation T790M [215]. The study was not included in patients with central nervous system metastasis. Osimertinib, one 3th generation EGFRC-TCI, was initially introduced for recurrent treatment failure at 1st/2nd-generation EGFR-1.90M. with previously untreated NSCLC and activating EGFR mutations of the type part19 or L858R, associated with prolonged PFS compared to 1st generation EGFR-TKI gefitinib or erlotinib. The median PFS was 18.9 and 10.2 months respectively; HR 0.46 [0.37-0.57]; p < 0.0001) [21]. Prolonged PFS were also seen in patients with CNS metastases, who could be present in this study. In a later follow-up of the FLAURA study, extended overall survival with osimertinib was also observed in comparison to geficonazole and erlolizumab. The median OSs were 38.6 and 31.8 months, respectively; the HR 0.80 [0.64-1.00], p = 0.046 [217]. Neither dacomitinib or osimemertinib has been directly compared with afatinib. Based on these data, both aphatinib as well as dakomitinib and osimmertinib would offer treatment advantages over 1squatume of first generation EGF-TCI, however, has been associated with the reported duration of treatment. The most common cause of treatment failure of 1st and 2nd generation EGFR-TKI is the development of resistance mutation T790M, where osimertinib is the best treatment option. In the event of failure of osimemertinib, the resistance mechanisms are more complex, and established treatment options in addition to conventional chemotherapy are often lacking. Therefore, the recommendation is to initiate treatment with one of the preparations among 2nd and 3rd generation EGFr-TCI, while the first generation TKI gefitinib and erlotinib can be seen as an alternative for intolerance to other preparations. Treatment with EGFR TKIs is given orally and daily as long as the patient is considered to benefit clinically from treatment. Insertion mutations in EGFR exon 20 usually indicate low sensitivity to established EGFR–TKIs, and here conventional platinum-based cytotoxic therapy persists as a first-hand choice. However, evaluation of several new preparations is ongoing both antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Amitantamab, an antibody that binds to both EGFR and MET, received in December 2021 EMA for treatment of patients with non-TS. The study reported response rates of 37% and median PFS of 8.3 months. Amitantamab is available for requisition, but has not yet undergone a health economic evaluation. The NT Council has decided in February 2022 on national interaction for amitantamab, which means that the drug is part of the process of national take-up and that the NT Council will make a recommendation to the regions on its use after undergoing a health-economic assessment. In 2023, a phase III study, PAPILLMON, was published, examining amitantamab in addition to first-line chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC and recognition mutation in EGFR exon 20 [218]. 308 patients were randomised to treatment with amitanab + platinum-based cytostatics (n=153) vs. cytostats alone (n=155). The results showed longer PFS with the combination regimen. Median PFS was 11.4 months with amivantamab + cytomag. The results were presented by ESMO 202 [220] alone and showed a reduced risk of progression or death with amivantamab + lazertinib. After a median follow-up time of 22 months, the PFS in comparison was amitantamab+ lazerumab vs. osimertinib. The results of the study were presented at ESMO 2023 [220]. In addition, lazertinib is not available for prescription. Mobocertinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR that has shown efficacy in activating insertion mutations in exon 20. The preparation has been studied in both the first and second lines, but is not approved in this indication. In the autumn of 2023, the responsible drug company announced that it will phase out the preparation. The decision is based on negative results in an unpublished study of mobocerumab vs. platinum-based chemotherapy (EXCLAIM-2).",

Other resistance mechanisms include MET or HER2amplification, PIK3CA re-arrangement, BRAF or KRAS mutations, and morphological conversion to small cell cancer. Therapy resistance to treatment with osimertinib may be associated with a range of molecular genetic mechanisms, of which a point mutation C797S in exon20 of the ECFR gene is one of the more common (approximately 16%) [229]. Therefore, in case of tumour progression, rebiopsation of tumour tissue and renewed molecular pathology analysis as guidance for treatment selection. Alternatively, a plasma sample can be used for treatment resistance mutation analysis. For treatment failure during treatment with 1st or 2nd generation ECFR TKI and demonstrated a clear resistance mutation with phase 490M was recommended. Phase III study (AURA 3) showed clear treatment benefits with osimertinib in comparison to platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin/carboplatin + pemetrexed) in the current situation [230]. Osimerumab was associated with higher overall response rates (ORR) 71% and 31%, respectively, and longer PFS (mPFS 10.2 and 4.4 months respectively; HR 0.30 [0.23-0.41]; p < 0.0001), as well as a higher CNS response rates (7.0% and 31%) and longer CNS-PFS (mCNS-PFSS 11.7 and 5.6 months respectively). In non-detected T790M mutation, clinical practice recommends treatment shifts to cytostatics (see below). This also applies to treatment failure on osimmertinib.

There are preclinical data showing that C79 can respond to 1st-generation EGFR-TKI, but clinical data are insufficient to recommend this in clinical practice.

OS results at the time of the primary analysis were immature, and showed no survival benefit with the amitantamab combinations vs. cytostatics. The results point to amitanamab as a potential treatment option we treatment failure on osimertinib. At the same time, the amivantamab combination MARIPOSA-2 was associated with significant toxicity, which may be weighed against a relatively modest PFS benefit, and the preparation still lacks the current indication.

Patients with ALK-rearrangement (usually the fusion gene between ALK and EML4) should be offered treatment with an ALK TKI. There are today five medicinal products that are approved for this indication in previously untreated patients: krizotinib, ceritinib, alektinib, brigatinib and lorlatinib. Ceritinib, alektinib and Brigatinib are also approved for treatment failure on crizotinib, whereas lor latinib is approved for prior treatment failure with ceriamine or alektinib or crizoamine plus another ALK–TKI (see below). Crizotinib and cericonazole have been associated in randomised studies with treatment benefits compared to conventional cytostatic therapy in previously treated patients with ALCLC. Krizotinib was compared in a phase III study (PROFILE 1014) with platinum (without maintenance treatment), and resulted in higher rates of tumour emissions (OR3.0% and 7.0% respectively). and led to higher tumour emission rates (ORR 74% and 41%, respectively) and longer PFS (mPFS 10,9 and 7.0 months respectively; HR 0.45 [0.35-0.60]); p < 0.001) [232]. Ceritinib was similarly compared in a phase III study (ASCEND-4) with platinum + pemetrexed (including pemetrexed maintenance), and resulted in both higher proportion of referrals (ORL 72.5% and 26.7% respectively) as prolonged PFSs (mPHS 16.6 and 8.1 months, respectively; H HR 0.55 [0.41-0.73); p < 0,00001) [233]. In ASCEND-4, 121 patients had CNS metastases at baseline. CNS responses were more frequently seen in patients receiving ceritinib (72.7 % and 27.3%, respectively). Alektinib and krizotinib have been investigated in two direct comparative studies, and in one Japanese study (J-ALEX) [234], both in a global study (ALEX), [235, 236] in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. Both studies showed higher treatment benefits with alektinib, and better central control. In the global study, the median PFS was 34.8 months with alektinib and 10.9 months with krizotinib (HR 0.43 [0.32-0.58]) and the time to CNS progression was significantly longer (HR 0.16 [0.10-0.28]; p < 0.001). The proportion of total tumour responses was similar between arms (82.9 % and 75.5%, respectively). In a follow-up analysis of ALEX [237], OS data were still immature, but indicated a clinically meaningful survival gain in patients treated with alectinib, with a 5-year survival rate of 62.5% compared to 45.5 % in the krizoftinib arm (HR 0.67 [0.46-0.98]). Also, brigatinib was investigated in a comparative study (ALTA-1L) with alextinib treatment arm, with 5 years of alenient NSC. In 2022, lorlatinib was also approved for treatment in the 1st line of ALK-pos patients. The indication is based on a comparative study (CROWN) of lorlatinib vs. krizotinib in previously untreated patients with ALK pos NSCLC [239]. The results show longer progression-free survival in patients receiving loralatinib (PFS at 12 months 78% vs 39%; HR 0.28 [0.19-0.41], p<0.001) and higher CNS response rates (82% vs. 23%). The conclusion is that both crizotinib and ceritinib are more effective than cytostatics and that alektinib, brigatinib and llorlatinib are increasingly effective in terms of progression- free survival (for alectinib also overall survival) and CNS control (the latter probably also applies to ceritinib, although direct comparative data are not overall recommended in the first hand aletinib, brigatinib or lor latinib in treatment-naïve patients with AlK-positive NSCLC, and crizotinib are assessed for a long duration of treatment.",

The sensitivity of ALK TKI in various mutations has been investigated in preclinical studies, but the predictive value of different ALK mutations for treatment effects in vivo is poorly validated. Nevertheless, consideration can be given to rebiopsing the tumour for new molecular genetic analysis in ALK–TK I therapy failure, or analysing circulating DNA in plasma (ctDNA) which may guide the continuation of treatment. All five registered ALK+TKIs are approved for the indication of relapse therapy at ALK positive NSCLC: crizotinib in patients who have previously received treatment with UNS (avser in first hand cytostatic therapy which at the time of approval was also first-line treatment also in ALKK-positive NSCLIC), ceritinib, alektinib and brigatinib in subjects previously treated with crizoamine, and lorlatinib in those patients who previously received either a treatment with a regimen such as a regimen, or in the patients receiving a regimen. In both cases, prolonged PFS with ALK-TKI: 5.4 and 1.6 months respectively for ceritinib (HR 0.49 [0.36-0.60]); p < 0.0001), and 9.6 and 1.4 months for alektinib ( HR 0.15 [0.08-0.29], p <0.001), and a higher CNS response rate of 35% and 5% with ceriamine and 54.2% and 0% with aleqtinib, respectively. The higher dose was mainly based on a randomised study (ALTA) in which patients with ALk-positive NSCLC who had prograted during treatment with crizotinib were randomised between two doses (90 and 180 mg) of brigatinib [24]. The results showed that the higher dose is more effective, with slightly higher total tumour emissions (55 % and 46 %, respectively, in patients with AlK positive NSCLAC who had been progrediated during therapy with crimotinib at two different doses ( 90 and 180mg) of Brigatinib (242). The greater dose was shown to be slightly higher, with a higher proportion of total tumouremissions (55% and 46 %), and higher rates, respectively in patients (67 % and 50m, respectively). The indication for lorlatinib is mainly based on a phase I/II study without a control arm [24]. The study included 229 patients with ALK positive NSCLC (plus 47 who were ROS1 positive), with all but 30 patients previously treated with at least one ALK-TKI.

RET fusions are seen in 1-2% of patients with NSCLC. The activity of multikinase inhibitors, such as cabozantinib, vandetanib, sunitinib, sorafenib and alektinib has in early studies varied with response rates between 16 and 47%. Pralsetinib is a more specific RET inhibitor that has recently been approved for treatment in patients with RET-fusion-positive advanced NSCLM that has not previously been treated with a RET inhibitors. The indication is based on results from a multicentre (ARROW) study of patients who have RET transfusion-positively advanced NPCLC in phase I/II [249]. The study shows responses of 61% in patients who had previously received platinum-based cytostatics (n=87) and 70% in previously untreated patients (n=17). Intracranial response was not observed in Europe. This is not based on lack of effectiveness but on the transfer of the marketing authorisation to another pharmaceutical company that does not intend to continue marketing the preparation in Europe. Selperkatinib is another new RET inhibitor that in phase I/II studies (LIBRETTO-001) has produced a response rate of 64% in patients with RET fusion-positive advanced NSCLC and prior chemotherapy therapy, and 85% in previously untreated patients [250]. Intracranial response was seen in 10/11 patients with CNS metastases. Selparkatinib has also been studied in a randomised phase III study (LIBRETTO-431) in the 1st line with cytostatic + pembrolizumab in the control arm [218] . The study included 212 patients with RET fusion positive advanced NCSLC, and showed a PFS benefit for sepperkatinib vs. chemo-immunotherapy. The median PFS was 24.8 vs. 11.2 months (HR 0.46 [0.31-0.70]). Based on the above, in RET fusion-positive advanced NSCLC treatment with pralsetinib or selperkatinib in patients who have not previously received RET inhibitors. Of MET variants, mutations involving MET exon 14 (METex14) spipping and MET amplification have been identified as driving mechanisms at NSCLC and thus potential targets for targeted therapy. Crizotinib, which has approved indications for the treatment of ALK and ROS1 positive tumours (see above), has also shown effects in METex14spipping with response rates of 32% [251, 252). Newer MET inhibitors include capmatinib and tepotinib. Kapmatinib received below 2022 EMA approval for treatment of patients with NSCLAC and METEX14 spipping previously treated with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based cytostatics. The approval is based on the results of a phase II study (GEOMETRY) that showed responses in 41% of previously treated patients (n=69) and 68% (metex14 cipping) with prior treatment regimens were also included in the study. In patients with advanced NSCex14-splitting regimens, the approval is based on data from a Phase II study (VISION) that showed 56% (trial revaluation) and 46% (independent evaluation) in 99 patients with METex14 squinting mutation, of which 56 had received prior system treatment [254]. Tepotinib is available for generalized prescription from May 1, 2023. Based on the above, we see both capmatinib and tepotinib as potential treatment options in patients with high-end NSCLC and METEX14-skipping mutation progrediating on other system regimens. Currently, tepotinib is recommended in an approved indication, based on the granting of subsidisation.

Indication is also available in patients who have EGFR or ALK positive tumours after failure of EGFR and ALK-TKI, respectively. The NT Council's initial recommendation to the regions in 2019 was not to use the combination, since there was no health economic evaluation for the overall population, and the treatment was not considered cost-effective for the TLV evaluated subpopulation with EGFR mutation or ALKS fusions. However, in a revised recommendation from the NT Council published in July 2021, the combination of the approved indication due to adjusted price of aezolizumab, to scientific evidence, and that the combination is now assessed as cost-efficient for the subpopulation of EGFFR mutations or ALQs has been investigated with the combination regimen of RACC and CID in November 2016.

Monotherapy with pembolizumab, atezolizumab or cemiplimab is recommended as a treatment option at high PD-1 expression in the tumour. We currently have insufficient evidence to recommend any of the treatment options over the others, then direct comparative data are not available. We currently have insufficient evidence to recommend any of the treatment options in front of the others, in the absence of direct comparative data. In situations where rapid treatment response is sought, e.g. in the case of rapid progression of tumour and/or influence on central structures of thorax, combination therapy with cytotoxic agents and immunotherapy is likely to be justified over monotherapy, if the patient is fit for this purpose. • Pembrolizumab is given in squamous cell carcinoma as induction therapy in combination with carboplatin + paclitaxel/nab paclitaxis, followed by maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab, and in other histological type in conjunction with platinum + pemetrexed, followed with maintenance treatment with pemolizumab + pemetrexed. • Atezolizumab is used in non-square cell carcinomas as induction treatment in combination to carboplacetine and nab-paclitaxis followed by athezolizumab maintenance therapy, or in combination, with carpoplatin, paclim and bevacizumab, as well as maintenance therapy of atezolizumab and bevaizumab. The indication is limited to patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% in tumour cells. • Iplilimumab + nivolumab is given in combination with platinum-based cytotoxics, selected with respect to histology, for two cycles of treatment, followed by maintenance therapy with ipilimumab + Nivolumab. • Monotherapy with athezolizumab is an option in patients with NSCLC and PD- L1 expression > 50% in tumour cell or ≥ 10% in tumour infiltrated immune cells.• Monotherapy of pembrolizumab remains as an option for patients with the NSCCLC and PD-1 expression ≥ 50% in the tumour. • monotherapy with pembolizumab is achieved with pnemolizumab, or ≥ 10 % in tumour infiltrating immune cells; • Monotherapies with premolizumab remain as a treatment option in subjects with NPCLC and PPD-L1. In all of the above immunotherapy studies, only patients with ECOG/WHO performance status (PS) 0 or 1. Whether survival gains can also be achieved in PS 2 populations or worse are not studied. Therefore, the above recommendation applies primarily to patients on PS 0 or 1, but can be considered also in selected cases with PS 2. In patients with PS 2 or risk factors for complications of immunotherapy, conventional cytotoxic therapy is still a treatment option. Several chemotherapy combinations can obtain partial tumour emissions in 20-30% of all treated patients, and median survival increases by 2-4 months. The latest meta-analysis of randomised studies is based on 2,714 patients from 16 randomised cytostatic studies [276]. The analysis shows a significant survival gain with chemotherapy compared to best supported care (HR 0.77 [0.71-0.83); p < 0.0001). This corresponds to an absolute increase in 1-year survival from 20% to 29%. At group level, the treatment also has positive effects on health-related quality of life. A combination of cisplatin and any of the preparations vinorelbine, docetaxel, paclitaxel, gemcitabine or pemetrexed appear to have similar effects on survival and quality of life based on published controlled studies. Albumin-bound paclitaxis (nab pacLitaxel) in combination with carboplatin has in a Phase III study in advanced NSCLC resulted in a higher proportion of remissions and less neurotoxicity compared to solution-based paclixel and carbolatin in the control arm, while progression-free and overall survival were similar with both combinations [277]. For pemetrexed, the efficacy appears to be best in adenocarcinoma, while the preparation is not recommended when squamous cell carcinoma dominates the histological image. Carboplattin has significantly replaced cisplatin in the palliative treatment of lung cancer. The reason for this is that carbopatin is easier to administer in open-patient care and has a more favourable toxicity profile than cisplatin. A meta-analysis of comparative studies with advanced non-small cell lung cancer has shown marginal benefits in subgroups of patients [278]. The optimal duration of 1st-line cytotoxic therapy in non-small cell lung cancer has been investigated in several comparative studies. Meta-analysis of these has shown no safe survival gains in providing more than 4 cycles of the same treatment regimen, while progression-free survival is prolonged by more cycles [279-281]. At the same time, increased toxicity is seen at longer treatment periods. However, for a preparation – pemetrexed – maintenance therapy remains approved in patients who have not progressed during induction therapy with a platinum-based cytotoxic regimen, and where the histological picture is not dominated by squamous cell carcinoma. Survival gains with induction chemotherapy followed by pemetrexed maintenance therapy as compared to induction chemotherapy alone have been demonstrated in two major randomised studies [282, 283). An objection to the design of these studies is the lack of structured treatment for progression, which may have contributed to less survival in the control arm. Maintenance therapy with pemetrexed can be considered in patients with NSCLC of a good general status (PS-1).",

Covered metal stones are easier to insert and the procedure can be performed on intubated patient if straight bronchoscopy is not possible. These stents are not as gentle to the airways as silicone stones and are slightly harder to extract. There are Y-stents that are partially covered. These are significantly easier to apply than the corresponding in silicone, but they are very difficult to extract and should therefore be reserved to patients who have advanced disease in a purely palliative stage. These stones require intuberification with a straight bronchooscope to be added. Stentling in the airway is associated with complications. Stenth migration can occur both early and late in the process of stentling and should be deposited with a stony.",

Antibiotic treatment should be initiated in symptomatic infections but in difficult cases the stent may need to be replaced. In some cases, securitisation can lead to occlusion of the stents with dyspnoea as a result. Often, the secretion can be evacuated with conventional bronchoscopy but in some cases there is a need for straight bronchoscopy in anaesthesia. Continent onset can be prevented with coke salt inhalations 5 ml x 4 daily for the first weeks after stoning. The patient should have contact with physiotherapist who instructs regarding PEP bottle and huffing. Granulation formation is noted in particular in patients with nasty metal stents but can also occur in patients who have heavy metal stentents. In case of congestionous symptoms, he may also be resected with diathermia or laser. Perforation is a special complication that can be seen in front of any treatment with a number of calendium. Intubation of the patient with stent in trachea requires special consideration. Primarily, intubations should be avoided given the risk of dislocating the stent. Still, assessed intuberance and intensive care should be indicated, the tube should be as small as possible (6-6.5). Intuberation should take place under bronchoscopic surveillance. 16.3 Combination of endobronchial plant and compression This is a common situation, perhaps the most common. It may be the primary tumor that grows through the airway or throughgrowth of lymph nodes adjacent to the airways. These patients are treated primarily with debulking, i.e. diathermia or laser to see how large lumens can be opened. In many cases, the patient also needs to be treated with stents. However, it is attempted, if acceptable lumens are opened and the air route is slightly intact, to avoid stentling considering the risk for complications.

However from quality of life studies we know that compared to other cancer diseases, the highest levels of anxiety and depression are reported in patients with pulmonary cancer [337]. The disease involves a series of disease-related losses [338] worrying about the future [339] fear of worsening and becoming a burden for their relatives [340]. Unexpected symptoms create more stress and fatigue are the symptoms experienced most straining in everyday life [341]. Studies of how patients with Lung cancer reflect over and live in their everyday lives show that, after an initial period of the anxiety and despair described above, one tends to strive to live as usual [341].

This is about choosing perspectives, wanting to have an idea that life continues, even if they are aware that it can soon end. However, this way of creating hope and making life easier can sometimes be misunderstood by the environment. Patients in the process of creating hopes can be perceived as being unrealisticly turned away with unrealistic expectations. A probable explanation, which should always be considered, however, is that it is about the patient's effort to maintain their self-image and create the opportunity to be present in life while it is going on. To avoid unnecessarily disrupting this process in the patient, it is valuable that as a caregiver you know how the hope-making process may seem to be, but also what notions of living close to death you yourself carry. In conclusion, healthcare professionals can make it easier for patients by: • preparing the patient for expected symptoms of illness and side effects of treatment. • Encourage contact nurse in case of new symptoms or troubles that you do not know again to quickly get an assessment and be able to avert unnecessary concern. • When the patient response is difficult.",

Therefore, there is no uniform template for which psychosocial interventions patients need and it is also difficult to rank them. The National Cancer Rehabilitation Care Programme makes a breakdown of basic, special, advanced and very advanced needs. Basic rehabilitation needs should be primarily met by doctors and contact nurses while other needs are met by other team professors or special rehabilitation teams. However, how the boundary between different levels is done in practice is not entirely self-evident. Therefore all health professionals need to have a responsiveness to the needs and expectations of the patient, and what this is needed to be helped with. When it comes to needs that transcend the own competence or ability to offer the patient to help establish contact with a team member or rehabilitation team that can meet these needs [345]. In the case of lung cancer, it is common for patients to undergo emotional experiences of loss, despair, anxiety and fear [338]. This can take different expressions, some people who have difficulty in expressing, while others do not want to know that. Studies suggest that every fifth patient wants professional psychological help but that this is not in a clear relationship to the stated level of anxiety/depression [346]. It therefore seems to be one thing to feel bad and another to want professional contact for this. A simple approach [347] is to systematically ask the question if the patient (or related ) is interested in a conversational contact with a curator or psychologist and offer to communicate contact. This question can be asked regularly, not only when the patient shows crisis and grief reactions, since it is ultimately about the patient's own motivation and readiness to receive help. The curator is the team member who specifically stands for and focuses on the psychosocial perspective of cancer care. The principal task of the curator is to promote patients' and relatives' living conditions. Briefly, it is about offering the opportunity to psychologically process the transition and be a link to social interventions in more complex social needs. Patients' initial motives for curator contact are often linked to patients' initial motivations contact.",

While it does not seem to be part of the health service's mission, we need to be clear here that we can make it easier for the patient, and possibly also for his or her loved ones, by reducing the overall burden of life. Contemporaneous research on psychological treatment emphasizes the importance of the relationship of the patient to help the patient [349]. A trusting relationship, working alliance, with one professional person that is genuinely concerned with the ability to understand and help him or her, even for the sake of his or herself, by decreasing the overall strain of life, is also a matter of concern. In an established conversational relationship, it is important to listen sorceressly and wonder together with the patient about what despair is based on, what its meaning and consequences are for the person. Respectfully twisting and reversing the experience can be a way of dedramatising. Furthermore, the experience of a helper who does not rush to unsubstantiated assurances, but remains and reflects on the difficult, contrasts with how others around the person react, which rarely makes the patient feel left behind by the difficult. The open reflection thus conveys acceptance and security. The reflective approach can also be combined with more structured interventions. Although the counselor has the most prominent role in psychosocial issues, all staff in cancer care have a psychosocial meaning for patients. Sometimes there is a special contact between a team member and patient who seems to have a helping or therapeutic significance for the patient. Perhaps the caregiver has conveyed genuine interest, consideration and accessibility and the relationship includes something more than the meetings usually do – one can feel particularly important and as there is one particular expectation from the patient's side. A good idea when this happens is to seek out a therapist or psychologist for how to deal with how to reflect over and how to perhaps the relationship.",

Carcinoid disorder usually requires liver metastasis, and occurs when endocrine products of the tumor do not break down into the liver but pass to the right heart.

In planned surgery, it is important to document the proximal delimitation of the tumour in the bronchia tree, preferably by photo.

Preoperative chemotherapy may be envisaged in isolated cases with atypical carcinoid, where a reduction of tumour mass is assessed to improve the possibility of complete resection. System therapy with chemotherapy or other pharmacological treatment is current in metastatic progressive disease. In asymptomatic disease and very slow growth studies involving bronchial carcinoides usually with a small percentage of follow-up. As bronchic alcarcinooids are relatively uncommon, few randomised studies are available to support treatment choices, and recommendations rest on the results of most cases of minor cases, as well as on studies of carcinooids from various organs in which bronchiac carcinomas have usually determined a small proportion. The frequency of objective tumour responses in these series have been relatively low, as a standard of treatment have been achieved.

The uses have been numerous (e.g. fire protection, thermal insulation, noise absorption, reinforcement, such as kitt and insulation in floor and tile laying as well as as as an ingredient in paints and plastics). Due to the carcinogenic properties of asbestos, in Sweden a ban first came against the most dangerous asbestos fibres in 1975 and then a total ban in 1982. In exposed individuals, inhaled asbestos fibre has been able to become trapped in the distal parts of the lungs and in pleura. As a result, phagocytes of macrophages have been formed resulting in the formation of asbest bodies. Likely, the chronic inflammation that contributes to the emergence of cancer and mesothelioma that usually occurs decades after exposition. In previously published epidemiological studies [350], 80-90% of mesotelioma cases in Swedish men could derive from earlier asbestos exposure, mostly professional, 30-50 years earlier. However, in Swedish women found chronic inflammations that contribute to the appearance of cancers and medeliomas that occur in the most decades. If there is occupational exposure, this should be reported as occupational injury. This is particularly important if the patient is of working age but may have some economic significance for the patient even after retirement. Other etiology includes prior radiotherapy (Mb Hodgkin and breast cancer with the doses that existed before), and erionitis – a mineral fibre that is not of asbestos type and that is lost in the environment in certain Turkish villages. Genetic predisposing factors, such as gemline mutations in BAP-1 (with increased risk of uveal melanoma, spitz nevi and mesothelioma) , could in individual cases contribute to the onset of the disease [384].

Typical radiological findings on CT are otherwise a unilateral thickening of pleural (and not rarely a crumple of hemithorax) alternatively widespread expansive changes based on pleura. PET/DT (Positron-Emissions-Tomography/Datortomography) can in most cases distinguish benign pleural thickening from malignant, but both false positive and negative appear to occur, although in low frequency.

For a safe diagnosis required as a rule of tissue biopsy, but with modern immunohistoric thickeners from malignants, however, both fake positive and adverse appear to be present, although at a lower frequency. In later stages where you do not have any fluid but only pleural thickening, you may take transtorical biopsies and in a single case you may do a torax surgical biopsy. Thorax surgical biopsy should be done as gently as possible and can often be done with peephole surgery (WATS), with one or two gateholes, or from outside the rib interstitium without going into pleura. Recommendations are to take biopsied from at least two or three different places on pleura and preferably so that the biopsy contains boundaries between pleural and other tissues of the chest, such as mediastinal fat/bind tissue, chest muscle/diafragma or lung.

In recent years, the extrapleural pulmectomin - in the few cases when surgery is considered - has been replaced in many places by a less invasive method. In this surgery, however, the entire lung is not removed on the affected side, but content itself with a total pleurectomy of parietal pleura as well as the decoration of the visceral pleura on the lung surface. Any deeper tumour growth in the lung is taken away with local resections. Although this method appears to be rather clearly linked with a minor degree of surgery, the study has also been lacked with scientific evidence in this study. This randomised study, with 335 patients with resectable disease, compares lung-sparing radical pleurectomy/decortication after induction and subsequent adjuvant therapy, with non-operative and only chemotherapy. Up to 42 months of follow-up, there was an increased risk of mortality as well as a significantly lower quality of life for patients undergoing surgery. No significant mortality difference was seen after 42 months (OR 0.48 p=0.15), but then only 15 patients remained in each arm.

This provided that the primary tumour, with possible locoin growth, can be assessed as being able to be removed radically a bloc, and that all pleural/pericardial metastasizes can also be removed with macroscopic radicality.

Therefore, one should be aware that in many cases there is no overall consensus on recommendations even if most apply similar treatment principles. The treatment recommendations for post-operative radiotherapy (PORT) depend on tumour stage, WHO classification and radicality in surgery. The most important prognostic factor is radicality at surgery. If this is not achieved, most people consider post-operational radiotherapy to be standard. In a complete resection, however, the indication of adjuvant radiotherapy depends on tumor stage and WHO classification [413]. In radically operated patients at tumour stage 1 the relapse rate is so low (< 2 %) that the prognosis is hardly improved by PORT. In one single randomised study, no effect of PORT [382] was seen, so the treatment is not recommended today [414].

Lung cancer association primarily addresses those who have received lung cancer, but also related people and others that think that work for better care, treatment, treatment and survival of lung cancer is important. Ling cancer association's vision is that no one should die in lung cancer! We also work to get rid of stigmatisation – everyone can suffer from lung cancer. We work for a fair and equal cancer care, for shorter waiting periods and for more research around lung cancers. An important goal is to become more members of the association. Patient association was started in 2004 with the aim of providing support to those who received lung lung cancer . For this reason, it was then named the support. After a number of years with small financial resources, the organisation had grown so that it met the requirements for financial support.",

A review of the national differences in lung cancer care is needed to find out what is the reason for the great inequality we are seeing today. Where you live should not determine which healthcare you are receiving! We participate in national and international congresses and in the work of local and national health care programmes, etc. The Lung Cancer Association also participates in national associations of patient associations and in several international associations, including patient associations for lung cancer. A stronger voice is more easily heard. Lungcancer Association is completely independent from political or other groups. We receive financial support in the form of state subsidies from the Social Board as well as contributing from the Cancer Fund. The association also carries out projects with support from pharmaceutical companies. The cooperation takes place entirely on the association's own terms andtri after the pharmaceutical industry's ethical regulations. We are happy for the rapid development of new effective medicines against lung cancer and are also urgent if it is going to be made: By becoming a member, you give the association the means and mandate to speak, wake up opinion and keep the business alive.
