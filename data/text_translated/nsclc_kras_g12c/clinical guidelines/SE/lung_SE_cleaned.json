The current edition under the mandate of the RCC was published for the first time in 2015. The Care Programme has been updated annually since 2018. This version is a revision of version 7.1 established Changes in version 8.0 of the Care Programme The National Care Programme for Lung Cancer has undergone a further revision with minor changes in most of the chapters in autumn 2023. For the 2024 edition, the chapter on psychosocial care has been revised in its entirety. The chapter on symptoms and clinical findings has been partially reworked with users in primary care in mind. In addition, the chapter on drug therapy in metastatic lung cancer has been updated with an up-to-date literature review of recommended indications for targeted therapy. The text on upcoming indications where indication is not yet available has been update. In view of the rapid developments, it is worth noting that the healthcare programme recommends testing for genetic changes in EGFR, BFRA, KRAS, ERBB2, MET, ALK, ROS1, and RTRK, as well as evaluation of PDL1 expressed by immunohistochemical analysis.",

      "text": "Obligations of care are regulated, among other things, in the Health Care Act (2017:30). It states that the goal of health care is good health and care on equal terms for the entire population and that health care activities are to be carried out in such a way that the requirements of good care are met. Good care is defined by the Social Administration as knowledge-based, purposeful, safe, patient-focused, efficient and equitable. The care programme provides recommendations on how care should be performed to meet these criteria. These recommendations should therefore be followed in essential parts in order to be considered to comply with the health care Act. The Patient Act (201821: 14) stipulates that the care provider must offer the patient tailored information on e.g. the possible alternatives for care, risks for side effects and expected information about the friendliness of the patient and the possibility of self-assessment of treatment within the same region. Under Section 1 (2) of the new law, the patient must also be offered the opportunity to choose between the same medical treatment. According to the same Act, the healthcare provider must offer a fixed healthcare contact and information about the possibility of a new medical assessment, even in another region. The healthcare service provider must also inform about the opportunity to choose a health care provider throughout the country within general and specialised outpatient care. According to what is known as the Patient Mobility Directive, the care provider also has to provide information on the patient's right to choose and receive compensation for such care throughout the EU/EEA that corresponds to what could be offered in Sweden. Practical information on this, such as how and when compensation is paid, is available from FÃ¶rsÃ¤kringskassan. Under the Care Guarantor (2010:349) the health care service provider has an obligation to offer patients and contact measures within certain times. The standardised care routes developed by the RCC and the regions that have taken the decision to follow the guidelines specify friends who are not part of the care guardian and children's healthcare, and Section 7 of the Child and Special Health Care Act also states that healthcare providers are obliged to provide them with support (5).",

In age groups up to 79 years, lung cancer incidence is higher among women, while men are still overweight in the highest age groups. However, many of these are likely to be cured of their lung cancer. The prognosis for lung cancer, as for other malignancies, depends on a number of clinical and tumor-related factors. Two of the most important clinical prognostic factors in lung cancer are tumour stage and patient performance status, but also sex (see above), age, tumour type, choice of treatment, and a range of tumour biological characteristics have prognosis significance. However, a proportion of the improved long-term survival can be attributed to therapeutic advances such as modern radiotherapy, while a widespread introduction of chemotherapy and modern pharmacotherapy in particular has affected 1-, 2- and 3-year survival in a favourable direction.",

The age-standardised incidence (ASR, European 2013) was 66 cases per 100,000 (men 94.5, women 44.1) [4]. Among Swedish men, the rate is the lowest in the EU, with Hungary topping the list, followed by Croatia and Greece (Figure 2.4). Among the other Nordic countries, Finland ranks best, while Denmark has the highest incidence. The relative 5-year survival rate is reported to be 25.4% (diagnostic years 2013-2019) [5] In China, which has a rapidly growing economy and in many respects today resembles the West in terms of lifestyle, including smoking habits, one can see a sharp increase in lung cancer.

      "heading": "3.1 Smoking of tobacco",
      "text": "Tobacco smoking is by far the most important single factor causing lung cancer, accounting for 80-90% of all new cases in Sweden. 90% of all patients with lung cancer are or have been smokers, and about 10% of all heavy smokers are affected by the disease. Smokers are at an increased risk of all the most common histopathological types of lung cancer. The association is particularly strong for squamous cell carcinoma and small cell lung cancers. Most never-smokers (about 15%) are found in the group with adenocarcinoma. The proportion of never smokers is higher among women than among men. Never-smoking is also significantly more common among younger patients (< 40 years) with lung cancer. Odds R (OR) for lung cancer in smokers and females respectively are presented in Table 3.1 [7, 8]. Table 3.1 Odds Ratio (OR) for lung cancer in smokers and ex-smokers OR (95% CI) for Lung cancer Men Never smoking Counter-smoking 23.9 (19.729.0) Former smokers Never Counter Smoking 7.5 (6.29.1) Women Smoking never Counter smoking 8.7 (7.410.3) Former smoking co-smoker 2.0 (1.62.4) There is a clear dose-risk relationship between smoking and lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer for a daily male smoker increases by a factor of 0.7 per 1 cigarette per day if it is not smoked. For example, if a man smokes cigarettes, the risk of developing lung cancer is 15 000 times higher than if he smokes carcinogenic substances such as nitrosamines and carcinogens. more than 3 000 different chemical substances, several of which, such as benzylpyrenes and nitrosamines, are known carcinogens and mutagens. Smoke also contains isotopes such as Po-210 and Pb-210 (alpha particles), which result in exposure to ionising radiation that in itself increases the risk of cancer. There is no evidence that smoking filter cigarettes or 'soft' cigarettes would result in a lower risk of lung cancer. The latency period for lung cancer is long, often 10-30 years from exposure to cancer development, and smokers experience early mutations in the bronchial mucosa, even in the absence of airway tissue. Clinical manifestation of lung cancers requires multiple mutations, at least 10-20 mutations. However, in smokers, smoke is often irreversible, and leads to an increased risk of developing lung cancer compared to smoking regular cigarettes, and the risk never doubles after about 10-15 years. secondary prevention aimed at smoking cessation in all patients, regardless of what they are seeking, is therefore an urgent task for all healthcare professionals to reduce the future risk of lung cancer, as well as the risk of other tobacco-related diseases (see also Chapter 4 Tobacco prevention). Passive smoking increases lung cancer risk by a factor of 1.2 and is estimated to cause about 25% of all lung cancer in never-smokers.",

      "heading": "3.2 Occupational exposure",
      "text": "The quantitatively most important occupational exposure in Sweden during the 20th century was asbestos exposure, which is estimated to have contributed to just under 10% of lung cancer cases in men during this period. Asbestos, a collective name for various silica, was widely used until 1976 when prohibition was introduced in Sweden. Especially exposed occupational groups were insulators, plumbers and shipyard workers, but also construction workers, car repairers, port workers and others have sometimes had significant exposure. The relationship between these factors can best be described as multiplicative. If the relative risk of lung cancer in asbestos-exposed individuals is doubled compared to a non-expressed population (applies to historical Swedish conditions), and about 15 times higher in smokers compared to never-smokers, the relative risks in those who both smoke and are exposed are approximately 30 times higher. Asbestos exposure thus increases the risk for lung cancer, especially among smokers, and should always prompt occupational injury reporting (unless the exposure was occupational) even if smoking is considered the main cause. The presence of other asbestose-related conditions such as pleural effusion or asbestosis supports the association between asbestoses exposure and actual lung cancer. In this context, the association of asbestosen exposure with the less commonly occurring primary form of malignant pleural tumour may also be mentioned. In this context, the link between asbestos exposure and the less common tumour form of primary malignant pleural mesothelioma may also be mentioned. The tumour type primarily affects individuals with extensive exposure to asbes and, unlike lung cancer, has no known etiological relationship with tobacco smoking. Other occupational factors of etiological importance for lung cancer include chloromethyl ethers used in certain chemical industries, hexavalent chromium, arsenic found in maltodextrin and in the manufacture of certain pesticides, nickel compounds and certain heavy metals such as cadmium used in battery and dye manufacturing.",

As with asbestos, there appears to be a synergistic link between exposure to ionizing radiation from smoking and the risk of lung cancers. Low-dose exposure of radon daughters in dwellings may also result in an increased risk of developing lung cancer. Based on Swedish case-control studies, it has been estimated that residential radon may be a contributing cause of 300400 cases of lung carcinoma each year. The increased risk has only been identified in smokers, which supports an assumed synergy between ionization and smoke.",

It is also known that families with established melanoma heredity may have mutations in the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A, and they also have an elevated risk of pancreatic cancer and other tobacco-related cancers such as lung cancer.[11] Therefore, one should always consult other cancer diagnostics or self-control programs and closely monitor patients for adenosine in the lungs at an early age.",

      "text": "Smoking is the most important underlying cause of lung cancer, but never-smokers also suffer from it. Taken as a separate diagnosis, lung cancer in people who have never smoked still constituted the 7th most common cause of cancer death in the world [12]. Never-smoking tumors, which are almost always of the adenocarcinoma type, have been suggested to have their own tumor biology with, among other things, a lower rate of proliferation and with fewer overall changes in the tumor genomes. The fact that lung cancers in never smokers (in studies usually defined as having smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in total) more often exhibit any of the tumor-driving mutations or gene fusions that allow treatment with targeted therapy has likely contributed to the recent increase in patient awareness of this particular group. Although the number of never-smokers with absolute lung cancer has increased in the same time period (about 10% and 15% respectively) among men and women, the numbers of lung cancer cases have never been as high as those registered in the national lung cancer registry data (2002). [13] The proportion of never smokers among lung cancer cases has remained relatively unchanged (about 15% for women and 10% for men) over the same period [13]. In younger people with lung cancer, the proportion of non-smokers is greater than in older lung cancer patients [13]. This indicates the presence of underlying hereditary factors, but until now, genetic mutations in families with accumulation of lung cancer have only been detected in a few different generations [10, 14, 15]. Other factors that may contribute to lung cancer incidence in never-smoking people are radon, various occupational exposures, passive smoking and air pollution (both indoor and outdoor) [16-18]. There are also reports that infections, hormonal factors and an unbalanced diet could play a role [19, 20].",

Action to reduce the proportion of smokers is the most important primary preventive action to reduce lung cancer mortality. â¢ Smoking cessation associated with lung cancer diagnosis improves survival rates for the individual patient and improves the chances of carrying out planned treatment. â¢ Individual patient's tobacco use should be recorded on an adequate linkage with healthcare contacts. â¢ Smoking lung cancer patients should be offered effective cessation of smoking 4.1 Causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer cessation related to lung cancer diagnoses can increase the effectiveness of treatment, reduce the risk of secondary tumours and may double the chance of survival. Short questions can arouse interest and initiate a treatment process leading to smoking cessation. Carcinogens in tobacco smoke not only act as tumour inducers, but can also contribute to the progression of tumour disease. If the patient can stop smoking at lung cancer diagnosis, the risk of heart disease, COPD, stroke and other tumours is also reduced. In international studies, the proportion of smokers diagnosed with lung cancer has been between 20 and 30% [21, 22]. Continued smoking is associated with a significantly increased mortality (HR 2,94; KI 1,157,54) and relapse (HR 1,86; KI 1,013,41) in the early stages of non-small cell lung cancer. For small cell lung cancer (limited disease), the overall mortality was increased (HR 1.86; KI 1.332.59), as was the risk of developing a second tumour (HR 4.31; KI 1.0916.98) and the risk for recurrence of the original tumor (HR 1.26; KI 1.0611.50) [23]. Quitting smoking is also associated with increased survival, decreased life expectancy, increased risk of osteoporosis [24]. contribute to supporting the smoking patient to stop smoking, and there should be a well-functioning chain of care to treat tobacco dependence; doctors cannot do all the work themselves, but they are important in the chain, not least because they often become the first link [25].",

Ask about tobacco at the beginning of the medical history, possibly together with general questions about occupation, asbestos exposure, housing conditions, etc. The question 'Do you smoke?' is rarely appropriate. It can feel confrontational towards presumptive smokers and somewhat misplaced to the one who looks like the health itself. 'Have you ever used tobacco?' is better and reveals whether the patient is e.g. a smoker (a reason for praise and encouragement). The question works well even when you think you know the patient doesn't use tobacco (and sometimes you get surprised). Follow up the question towards the end of the consultation/writing. Is it OK? How would you feel? Have you been contacted? Have your body fit? How much time is clear and how do you want to stop smoking? These questions are just a few minutes of reflection:  How do you feel it is important to quit smoking now?",

The ideal screening method should have high sensitivity for detection and high specificity, i.e. few false positive tests. The method itself should not entail any increased risk to the individual, e.g. high radiation doses, and should be economically justifiable.[33] The main goal of screening is to reduce mortality in the disease. Survival in lung cancer is directly related to the stage at which the disease is diagnosed, the lower the stage, the better the chance of survival. There is considerable evidence that screening through early detection could be a good method to reduce cancer mortality [34]: â¢ The disease has high morbidity and mortality. â¢ It is a common tumor disease. â¢ There is a dominant risk factor, ie the population, which makes screening possible, and the risk is defined by the asymptotic stage. â¢ Lung cancer therapy is only possible during an earlier part of the course of treatment. These are common sources of error when screening is used to identify tumour diseases at early stages: â¢ Lead-time bias  the tumour is detected at an earlier stage of the disease course but the patient dies at the same time as without screening. This means that the patient lives longer with knowledge of the illness. â¢ â¡Length-time prejudice â¡ the screening detects smaller more aggressive tumours, while aggressive ones are detected by symptoms, meaning that the tumours detected on screening have a seemingly better prognosis. â¢ Overdiagnosis, i.e. detection of very slowly progressing tumours.

The main exposure to radiation occurs in the group requiring follow-up radiological examinations. â¢ The detection of false positive changes with accompanying follow up and/ or diagnosis may cause unnecessary concern and anxiety through fear of having lung cancer. 5.3 Screening with lung X-ray and/or sputum cytology Six randomised studies and one non-randomised study have attempted to answer whether lung x-rays can be used as a screening for lung cancer, either alone or in combination with sputum cycology. After this time, 206 lung cancers had been detected in the screening arms compared to 160 cases in the control group. At 20 years of follow-up, there was a slightly higher mortality rate in the screened group (4.4 compared to 3.9 deaths per 1,000 patient years).

      "text": "Until August 2011, only cohort studies of low-dose DT screening were published. One of these, I-ELCAP, is a collaboration between 38 centres in five countries [38]. A total of 31 567 asymptomatic individuals with a smoking exposure equivalent to > 10 pack years were screened with a baseline DT, and 27 456 were followed up with annual DT examinations. Positive findings justifying follow-up examinations were noted in 13% of initial DT investigations and in 5% of the follow-ups. However, the effects on lung cancer mortality could not be assessed in this study. In August 2011, The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) [35] was published, in which 53 454 people were included and randomised to either low-dose DT or conventional lung X-ray screening. The study population was people aged 55 to 74 with a smoking history equivalent to at least 30 pack years. and has resulted, inter alia, in the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) conducting a workshop on lung cancer screening [40]. It was concluded that the data from the NLST are valid, but that significant issues remain to be addressed before any large-scale implementation of lung cancer screenings internationally is possible. Such issues include: â¢ identifying the population that will benefit most from screening; â¢ investigating the cost-effectiveness of DT-screenings; â¢ harmonising DT screening protocols with regard to performance and volumetric analysis; â¢ defining the value of follow-up techniques, standardising performance and defining adequacy sequence; â¢ determining the optimal surgical procedure for screening uncovered nodes; â¢ establishing the optimal screening intervals and number of examinations for both tripartite screening and negative finding; â¢ forming a forum for encouraging research projects to improve outcomes, reduce costs and optimise the selection of studies; and â¢ comparing the results of the study with those of other screening populations. In another project  PLCO Screening Trial , the criteria for the selection of the study population have been validated and compared with the NLSLT [41]. The choice of participants in PLCO was based on a variety of factors such as age, race/ethnicity, educational level, BMI, prevalence of COPD, previous cancer, lung cancer in the family, and smoking exposure. With this screening sample, the sensitivity was 83% in the PLCO compared to 71% in the NLST, and the positive predictive value increased from 3,4% to 4% without decreasing the specificity. The authors of NLST have also concluded in a review article on screening [42] that there is a synergy between screening and rhinoplasty measures. Thus, there is need to better define the population, frequency of examinations, and improve methods for potentially discriminating between malignant bone findings and outcomes. The main studies were conducted in January 2020 in Nelson, Belgium, and published by the Netherlands [43]. In January 2020, the main results of the Nelson study, conducted in the Netherlands and Belgium, were published.[43] During the 2003-2006 period, 15,789 individuals (13,195 men, 2,594 women) aged 50 to 74 years and with a smoking exposure equivalent to at least 15 packet years were included, and they were randomized to screening with low-dose computed tomography on four occasions (at year 0 and after 1.3 and 5.5 years) or no screening. At follow-up in 2015, after at least 10 observations, the incidence of lung cancer in men was 5.58 cases per 1,000 person-years in the screening group and 4.91 cases per 1000 person-year in the control group. The cumulative relative risk of death from lung cancer was 0.76 (0.610.94; p = 0.01) in the long-term screening groups compared to the control groups. Women had a relative risk for lung cancer of 0.670.381. Thus, the resulting mortality reduction shows an even greater positive effect on lung cancer risk in men than in women.[44] from an Italian screening study MILD published in 2019 [44] supports a positive effect of screening with LDCT on reduction of lung cancer mortality. In this study, 4099 people participated, including 2367 in the screening arm (1190 annual controls with LCDT and 1186 controlled every two years to 6 years) and 1723 in the control arm, aged over 49 years with a smoking exposure of over 20 packs of years. Analysis of survival data at 10 years has shown a 39% risk reduction for lung cancer death (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.39-0.95) and 58% risk reduced for pulmonary cancer death at 10 year control jmf with 5 year control (HR 0,42; 95%CI 0.22-0.79). The combined results of several randomised trials, NL and NELST shows that the use of low-dose DDCT in screening arms may decrease the risk of developing lung cancer, and justifies the introduction of the Swedish Lung Cancer Strategy in 2019. A study synopsis for the national introduction of lung cancer screening has been authored by the Swedish Lung Cancer Planning Group and presented to SoS in June 2021. Based on data from existing studies, it is proposed that low-dose DT within lung cancer screenings should be performed at the start and then every two years until age 74 or lung cancer diagnosis. Screening should be terminated if it has passed 20 years after smoking cessation but at least 3 checks should be offered to these people, which should also apply to those aged 74 during the screening program. Smoking ban programs should be provided to all active smokers. However, it is assessed that the basis for lung cancer screening does not meet the criteria of the Swedish Social Agency for further investigation of a general recommendation on screening mainly because the screening population is determined by a lifestyle factor. The SoS is looking for Swedish implementation studies that will be able to shed light on many issues related to lung cancer screen ing in a Swedish context, such as how to reach the risk population, more precise figures regarding the proportion responding to screening, the proportion meeting screening criteria, the percentage who will be examined, the share of positive cases and the proportion of positive outcomes, the impact of the findings on the frequency of screening and the possibility of launching a national screening plan in Sweden as soon as possible. A pilot project for lung cancer screening in Sweden (PLUS) was launched in September 2022 within RCC Stockholm-Gotland. Around 1000 women aged 5574 years will receive a survey sent home with questions related to smoking and the women who meet the criteria for inclusion in LDCT screening will be offered participation in the study. By November 2023, surveys have been sent to nearly 27 000 women, 33% of whom responded to surveys and 10% met the screening criteria. 650 women have been screened by November 2023 and 6% of these have been referred to the Lung Cancer Centre for investigation and 11% have plans for LCDT control within 612 months. 5 women have undergone surgery for lung cancers in the early stages. The final report is expected to be completed by 2025. The study is also planned to be implemented in cooperation with 1000 individuals in the Western Nordic region during the first year of the project. The objective is to screen 1000 people in each region over a period of 2 years; inclusion will be based on the same criteria as in the study synopsis of the planning group; people will be recruited from different socioeconomic areas according to the geographical database of the Central Statistical Office (Reg So) and the project will be combined with smoking cessation measures.",

In high quality immunohistochemical analyses, as these are given great weight in the validation of pathology. There are a large number of factors that affect the outcome of the diagnosis and other pathological factors that can lead to the result of the colour analysis of the individual case. In addition, for squamous cell carcinoma and neuroendocrine tumours of the lung, the ability to assess the origin is limited even at resection, as the morphology and immunohistochemical profile are often not indicative. Assessing whether a tumour is new/synchronous or recurrent/intrapulmonary metastasis can also be very difficult; morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular analyses can ideally provide guidance and multidisciplinary assessment is recommended. Normally, the diagnosis is made by a sample of a pathologist. The need for internal and/or external consultation is decided by the responsible diagnosticians. Re-evaluation of relevant preparations should be done before the multidisciplinarie conference (KMD). Re-evaluation of relevant preparations should take place prior to the multidisciplinary conference (MDK). Further review may also be requested by the treating physician prior to final treatment decision if 1) the PAD response lacks complete data required for treatment decision, 2) the case was primarily diagnosed by a pathologist who does not have a thorax pathology or cytology focus, or 3) the patient wishes a second opinion. 8.2 Sample handling instructions Regardless of the type of sample (cytology/biopsy/resectate), the sample material should be handled in such a way that both immunohistochemical staining and molecular pathology analysis can be performed. As the sample material is often limited in lung cancer investigation, close collaboration between inpatient clinicians and the REGION pathology department is recommended to enhance the quality of the bronchial pathology as a result of further pat exchange and to ensure that the preparation is immu fixerin I raw sample fixerin (meto cytolo (CytoL functioning lymphomas Maternal normal fluid) simply (EBU cytolo limit NALA CANCERCENTRUM p allows locally functioning routines for sampling/ sampling management and for a proportion of cases replacement sufficient for diagnosis/ classification to provide adequate complementary analyses.

In addition, Ki67 index may have predictive relevance, especially in metastatic disease for selection of drug therapy and nuclear medicine therapy. 8.5 Treatment-predictive molecular pathology assays The indication for targeted therapy includes advanced non-small cell lung cancer with activating mutation in EGFR (point mutation or deletion in some domains), BRAF (V600), KRAS (G12C), MET (exon 14-skipping) and soon ERBB2, as well as genus/translocation of ALK (most commonly inversion and fusion with EMLOS4), ROS1 fusion (with multiple CD74, but with other partners), or NETK. Indication for immunomodulatory therapy with PD-1 or PD-1 inhibitors is included in the treatment history of certain non-immune cell lung cancers for which immunotherapy is not recommended. non-small cell lung cancer where immunohistochemical testing is currently recommended as part of the basis for treatment decisions for some drugs. Targeted therapy for EGFR mutation and immunotherapy for high PD-L1 expression (and absence of EGFR Mutation and ALK fusion) are used in addition adjuvantly after surgery, therefore molecular pathological testing is relevant even at an early stage. There is scientific evidence and clinical experience of detecting molecular genetic changes on both cytological and histological material, while the basis is still somewhat limited for immunohistory for PD- L1 on cytology. Localization of predictive assays (both immunoassay and FISH sequencing) is recommended for cytology processing as the material may differ between sections and may affect its quality. There are different methods of PCR/SNG sequencing and mass sequencing (e. g. sequencing based on ECFR/NGR). detect EGFR mutation, e.g. massive parallel sequencing/NGS (next generation sequencing) and PCR-based methods. Immunohistochemical staining and FISH have been previously tested as alternative methods for EGFR analysis, but are not therapeutic and are therefore not recommended. Gene rearrangement/translocation can be detected with FISH, immunohistochimic staining, NGS (most often at RNA level) or PCR based assays. For ALK, immune histology alone is sufficient for detection (with complementary FISH or other method only in case of inconclusive results). Experience from, among others, NordiQC's external quality control programme (Run39, 2013) has shown difficulties in optimally detecting ALK in the lung carcinoma compared to clon K1A5 and clon D3A4 and therefore the CE-IV-D kit is recommended first. For ROS1 (clones SP384 or D4D6, where the former is available as a CE-IVD-labelled kit and therefore recommended) and NTRK immunohistochemistry can be used for screening but with confirmatory FISH or NGS/PCR-based techniques if positive. There are different tests for PD-L1 used in studies for the different drugs in question, with different antibody clones tested on partially different platforms and with different cutoff levels for positive test. At least 100 evaluable tumour cells are recommended regardless of the test. However, clone SP142 (coupled to atezolizumab in non-adjuvant situation) differs from the others and cannot be replaced by any other clone. This means that if testing is desired specifically for atezolizeumab (not adjuvant treatment) then SP141 should be used. This test also includes evaluation of tumour-associated immune cells (which cannot be evaluated cytologically). Generally, testing of all non-small cell lung cancer samples is recommended. Biopsychological tests for biopsies and genotoxicity of tumours are recommended for the diagnosis of neuroendocrine cancer and should be possible when sampling large tumour samples. For example, testing for imaging of large-cell neuroendocrine cancer on biopsy/cytology is recommended. Otherwise, as a rule, neuroendocrinal tumors or cancer of the salivary gland type are not tested for a certain diagnosis. However, the demand from clinicians and local routine governs, and for patients who have never smoked and/or are younger, clinicians often desire a molecular pathological analysis regardless of the histological type of lung cancer. Similarly, local routines may govern what is the appropriate course of action if one or more analyses are not possible to perform. For instance, supplementation with targeted fusion gene assays may be judged to be of less value if multiplex testing has not worked and squamous cell carcinoma has been established as a pre-diagnosis. A patient deemed suitable for targeted therapy should often be re-evaluated. Testing should be done at initial diagnosis but also repeated at progression, relapse or metastasis if the patient has received systemic therapy, and then especially if targeted therapy has been given. Treatment pressure often leads to clonal evolution and selection within the tumour with emergence of resistance to the primary therapy. Finding resistance factors (if necessary with extended resistance panel) may lead to the selection of a new targeted treatment. Based on current treatment strategy and drug indications (especially when multiple targeted drugs are approved in the first line) and ongoing studies, testing should include at least EGFR, KRASF, BRAF, MBB, MET2, ERK, ROS1, NETK, and PDTR1. In addition to the treatment-inducing EGFR T790M mutation, mutations in ALK and BRAF as well as amplification of MET and ERBB2 may also be of interest in treatment failure/resistance following treatment with targeted therapy. Multiplex analyses such as NGS are recommended. The sample range is radically reduced and a few slices from a representative interstitial biopsy are often sufficient for all analyses. Furthermore, response times can be reasonable as five working days is sufficient for most available techniques. With next-generation NGS panels (known as comprehensive genomiciling), all types of treatment-possible genetic aberrations (point mutations, fusion mutations and amplifications) can be analysed in one and the same analysis. In the Swedish collaboration Genomic Medicine Sweden (GMS), such a panel has been validated (gMS560) and is being implemented nationally via the country's molecular pathology laboratories during 8.6 Microscopic evaluation of neoadjuvant therapy In neoadjunctive treated tumour, the whole tumour should be lined if maximum size â¤3 cm, otherwise at least 1 piece per incipient cm should be lied in maximum size (i.e. 4 pieces from tumour size 3,14,0 cm). Based on microscopy, for the area where the tumour has been (i.e. excluding surrounding reactive changes), from all examined areas/glasses taken together, indicate the proportion of (1) viable tumour, (2) necrosis and (3) stroma (including inflammation and fibrosis) in a 10% interval (but the exact percentage if < 5%) where the sum of the three is to be 100%.

According to the National Quality Registry, about 60% of patients are investigated with PET DT, and the use is relatively similar throughout the country. In some cases, symptoms and alarming findings on the lung X-ray may lead to an initial investigation carried out with PETDT in which DT is performed with diagnostic quality. However, in most cases, investigation is carried out using contrast enhanced DT upper chest including to the lower abdominal kidneys. The DT should be with a diameter (â¤ 1 mm) to be able to better evaluate the findings and provide an accurate measurement of the size of the tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be of value for evaluating overgrowth and correct T-stage, e.g. investigation of tumors of the apical lung with suspected sympathetic nervous system invasion, i.e. pancoast tumors Glands in the hilus and suspected mastinum are assessed by size; short shoulder measurements are indicated and appearance is assessed; fetal plethysm is often a sign of bone metastasis; position of metastatic glands, size of the pleural cavity, or N-dimensional appearance of the abdominal fluid is indicated; and contra-classification of suspected changes in the lung, pelvic and skeletal organs can be used to correctly classify and counterbalance the risk of malignancy. Lymph node metastases are more common if the tumour is solid and/or centrally growing [56]. In patients without enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, they are found in approximately 20% of cases and enlargement of the lymph node may also be benign. Consequently, DT alone has too low sensitivity and specificity for a safe assessment of N-stage. If mediastinal metastasis is crucial for the treatment decision, then DT should be complemented by PET-DT and possibly invasive diagnostics (see section 9.7 Mediastinal classification of PET).",

(See Section 19.1 Carcinoids) Radiological changes of unclear pathological significance in the liver are frequently detected. Further radiological characterisation of such changes may be performed with MRI, ultrasound or DT examination. The examination methods have different advantages and disadvantages. Further investigations of enlarged adrenal glands are carried out according to local routines. Binjure changes that are round or oval, waist-bound and with a homogeneous density â¤ 10 Hounsfield units (HU) on native DT images strongly speak for benign genes. If high uptake at PET-DT, this may be a false positive as even benign barcadenomas may have high absorption. If the adrenal change has not increased FDG uptake, this is often negative due to the high negative predictive value (NPV) of the method. The adrenal can also be tested via EUS to verify any spread. MRI is a sensitive method for assessing skeletal changes. In addition to the appearance of DT, it is often possible to assess the likelihood of metastases. PET-T is also a good method for checking the skeleton for the frequently occurring metastasis in FGD [57]. is also a good method for the detection of bone metastases due to the frequent occurrence of elevated FDG uptake in metastasis [57]. Brain DT with contrast agents (and skeletal algorithm) should be done in the primary investigation of stage III non-small cell lung cancer before deciding on curative targeted radiation chemotherapy, in individuals with advanced lung cancer with demonstrated tumour-driving mutations, and should be considered already in the initial investigation of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). If DT brain with contrast agent is inconclusive, brain MRI should be performed. SCLC has 1015% asymptomatic brain metastase at diagnosis [58]. In other cases, brain DT/MRI is done at the clinical sign of brain stasis. MRI has higher sensitivity to small cell lymphomas and carcinomas of the brain, and if appropriate, the treatment of such cases should be selected. for the detection of small brain metastases and leptomeningeal carcinomas, and should be selected if their detection is critical to treatment. The detection on DT of solitary or isolated brain metasts should be verified by MRI, as surgery or stereotactic radiotherapy of the metastasis may be appropriate if the spread is limited.

The detection of vocal cord pairs almost always implies tumour spread to the mediastinum, and is classified as T4. â¢ Perform transbronchial sampling from mediastinal lymph nodes, for classification in the NK staging category. Contraindications to broncoscopy include unstable coronary artery disease, severe hypoxia or treatment with anticoagulants, e.g. Waranti, NOAK, or low-dose molecular therapy with heparyltin, which cannot be ruled out as a means of acute cardiovascular events, but should be advised by a cardiologist in consultation with at least 4 cardiologists. After acute myocardial infarction, bronchoscopy should be waited for at least 4 weeks, but individual assessment in consultation with a cardiologist is recommended.

TBNA can in some cases be performed without EBUS, e.g. for indirect tumour findings without endoboronchial breakthrough (central tumour compression), and for the detection of larger lymph glands on DT or PET-DT, mainly subcarinal. EBUS-TBNA is performed with a special bronchoscope with ultrasonic samples and needle system for real-time control at puncture. The examination is usually carried out in the same way as ordinary bronchoscopy in an outpatient setting. According to the National Quality Register, about 20% of patients diagnosed with lung cancer go through an EBUS. From there, the EBUS is applied over the country, where the quality register varies, and according to the southern quality register, most often in the northern region, where it is common to inspect the airway with EBUS to initiate the examination. The preparations for EBUS-TBNA are cytological, so repeated punctures are recommended in order to obtain a sufficiently large diagnostic material. The sample from the puncture should be handled in such a way that cell blocks can be created, which gives greater diagnostic possibilities. In the cytological sampling, if possible, cytodiagnostics should be present in order for the representativeness of the sample to be assessed (ROSE = rapid on site examination). EBUS is a diagnostic tool that can be used in various ways. Firstly, a diagnosis can be made where EBUS material is taken from parabronchial cells for the purpose of carrying out histological diagnostics including molecular pathology testing of the EBUS at a PET-positive target, e.g. in NUS2 or NUS3, i.e. in the presence of a limited number of malignant cells directed against cancer, for the purposes of surgical verification, in the event of a malignant cell being exposed to radiation. thirdly, EBUS is recommended for staging in its strict sense, according to the ESMO guidelines (see Fig. 9.2) for cytological/PAD verification of lymph nodes in the mediastinum [62]. Mediastinal staging is performed by first puncturing lymph node in N3 position, then in N2 position and finally in N1.

Mediastinal sampling is not required for PET-positive tumour â¤ 3 cm, in the peripheral third of the lung, and PET-negative, non-enlarged lymph nodes N0. In the case of a tumour located periphery, the EBUS for staging can be combined with radial ultrasound in the lumen, allowing the diagnosis of both the primary tumour and staging to be performed in the same session. If successful, the patient will only need to undergo a diagnostic intervention. Complications of sampling by bronchoscopy/USU include first-line bleeding. Fatal bleeding is described by biopsy of the central vessels. EBUS is uncommon but is a serious complication after biopsy. In transbronchial biopsies of peripheral tumours, in addition to bleeding, there is also a risk of pneumothorax. It is important for bronchoscopists to practise wedging of the bronchoscope and balloon padding in quiet conditions, as methods to manage unexpected bleeding complications. In isolated cases, air emboli have occurred that may require pressure chamber treatment. The combination of EBUS and EUS has a strong priority in the National Guidelines for Lung Cancer Care (high strength of recommendation).

The stage classification is also a prerequisite for the correct evaluation of treatment outcomes, especially in terms of survival. A TNM classification describing the spread of the primary tumour (T), any glandular metastases (N) and the presence of any distant metastasis (M) is used as the basis for the stage-classification. The clinical TNm classification (cTNM) describes the tumour spread before any operation. The classification does not describe the examinations to be included as a basis for a classification, which can lead to differences in accuracy between different materials. However, normally, a DT examination of the thorax and upper abdomen and a bronchoscopy of the abdomen are used as a baseline to obtain an accurate clinical classification. In some cases, no treatment is recommended based on a clinical examination and a PET scan of the chest or heart. In isolated cases where no treatment is planned, the stage classification may sometimes be based on pulmonary X-ray and clinical examination, which is of course an uncertain basis. After a possible operation, additional information may be obtained that may demonstrate a smaller or more extensive tumor spread than the clinical TNM classification. This is indicated as pathological TNm status (pTNM). After a classification according to TNMs, the TNMS categories are grouped into different summary stages. This stage classifier is revised with equal intervals. Changes in the latest version include a more graded classification of the size of the primary tumor up to 5 cm, an upgrade of T-status for tumors over 5 cm (from T2b to T3) and 7 cm (From T3 to T4) respectively, upgrading of T status for overgrowth on the diaphragm (Fronto T4), simplification of T classification for tumour growth in the head bronchus (T2 regardless of distance to the carina), simplification for T-classification for athlete's size (T2-classified irrespective of scope), overgravity on the mediastinal pleura removed as T-criterion, and a division of distances between M1 metastases (oligoplasty) and M1 multiple plaques (multiple plaques) has been proposed for the Nastas test, but has not been modified (see below).

The position of pretracheal lymph nodes was redefined already in the 7th edition: They are counted on the right side even if they are located in the medelline, and only lymph glands completely to the left if the lateral boundary of the trachea is counted in the left side. In the summary stage classification, a new stage IIIC has been introduced, and stage IV is divided into two levels (IVA and IVB). Since the previous version (7th Edition), small cell lung cancer is also included in the TNM classification. a lung, mediastinum and supraclavicular lymph nodes (the definition of ipsi- or bilateral supracavicular metastases has varied). Limited disease (LD) corresponds in current systems to T14 N03 M0, with the exception of T34 caused by multiple pulmonary nodules not contained in a tolerable radiation field. Widespread disease (ED) is now all distant metastatic disease (M1a/b) and T24 due to multiple lung metastasis. The current TNM classification, 8th edition, is summarized in the following table and figure. In 2024, a new TMN classification is expected to be presented [72].

      "text": "Surgery for localized recurrence after previously curative surgery or other treatment (SBRT or radiochemotherapy), so-called \"salvage surgery\", is a relatively new concept in the lung cancer field [73-75]. In recent years, the concept has been extended to include patients with more advanced stages (IIIB-IV) who received targeted therapy or combinations of immunotherapy [76, 77]. The studies, mostly small retrospective case series, often show good results, but are neither prospective nor randomized and lack a control group. Moreover, they show that the surgery is not entirely risk-free. Surgery in these cases is not recommended, but should only be carried out within the framework of treatment studies or in a very selective case when other forms of alternative treatment are excluded. It is important to note that studies in such cases should be locally well-designed and well-studied, and should be followed up with less frequent surgical procedures, such as LRT, or even consolidated with SBRT, even in cases of chronic disease [78, 79]. In the surgical treatment of oligostatic disease is also described in Chapter 13.5.3.1 Radiotherapy in oligostate disease (SCOMD) Regarding neoadjuvanted treatment with immunosuppressive therapy in the case of NLC, the number of studies is 2-fold. A randomized controlled trial with triple-platinum IBIA + 3-fold has been published at the first stage [81]. The control arm received double platinum status. Results showed that the treatment was safe without complicating, delaying or risking planned surgery and with 24 percent (compared to 2.2%) complete pathological response and a significant increase in median event-free survival. Similar positive results regarding the median incident- free survival were also obtained in the recently published 2-year follow-up with perioperative (i.e. both non-adjuvant and adjuvant) pembrolizumab in conjunction with surgery at stage II-IIIA [82]. Studies with other designs, other more advanced immunosuppressive and more advanced stages linked to surgery are also initiated. The fact that the different studies regarding neoadjunctive treatment have different designs with partially overlapping patient groups makes the results difficult to translate into daily and special clinical trials.",

      "text": "The standard procedure for access through the chest wall has traditionally been a thoracotomy, in the majority of cases in the form of a so-called muscle-sparing anterior or anterolateral thoractomy. When greater accessibility is required, a larger posterolateal incision has sometimes been used. A minimally invasive surgical technique, called VATS surgery (Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery), has developed very rapidly in recent years and is gaining widespread acceptance, including in Sweden. A number of non-randomized studies have been published, mainly in patients with stage I disease, comparing tumor resection via VATS with conventional techniques, and meta-analyses have shown slightly shorter duration of treatment, slightly less mortality, and a significant reduction in overall postoperative pain for patients who are operated on with VATS, and significantly less post-operative pneumonia [85-87]. This is also consistent with the results of a larger UK randomized trial (VIOLET) whose one-year results were published in 2021, but whose long-term survival results are delayed further [88]. No comparative randomized study with long term follow-up on prognosis has been published to date (January 2024). The above meta-analyses, based on non-randomized material, have shown a meta-prediction of about 5 percentage points for 5-year survival for VATS-operated patients [86]. At WCLC 2019 in Barcelona, preliminary results from the first randomised Chinese study comparing long term outcomes from a non-inferiority total design were presented as non-specific [89]. No significant difference in survival between VATS and open surgery was detected, either in terms of cancer-specific or overall survival. Overall, VATS is considered today  despite the absence of published randomised studies on prognosis and long-term survival  to be a complete (non-inferior) alternative to open thoracotomy in small peripheral tumours without signs of spread (stage I), with significantly reduced pain immediately postoperatively and shorter drainage and care time. One of the concerns with VATS, based on several published studies, could be a tendency to decreased lymph node replacement during this type of surgery and whether this would have any effect on the longevity of survivors. Therefore, the long term findings from e.g. a randomized study and the Danish study VIETOL 908, mentioned above, are still unknown [8]. Therefore, the long-term results from e.g. a Danish randomised study and the above-mentioned VIOLET study [88, 90] are still awaited. Similarly, the publication of the 2019 Chinese randomized study [89] is still pending. The proportion of pulmonary resectomies has been steadily decreasing in recent years and today accounts for only a few percent of the procedures in Sweden. Sublobar resections in the form of anatomical enthectomy or non-anatomical kidney resections have increased and account for more than one eighth of the total proportion of resections [91]. The surgical intervention in lung cancer resection is lobectomy, since the lung lobe in which the tumor is located is the most common, provided that this can be done with acceptable margins. The risk of surgery is relatively low with a mortality rate of about 0.5% in Sweden today [91]. Bilobektomies can be performed on right-sided tumors with overgrowth on adjacent lobes or common intermediate bronchi. In recent years, sublobular resections have been discussed as an alternative to tomy, also for parenchymal purposes. Lobotomy as the gold standard, regardless of the size of the tumour, is based on the 1996 LCSG (Lunger Group Study), in which lobotomy was compared with sublobar tomy in terms of local cancer recurrence and specificity and survival [92]. There was a significant difference in overall survival (73% versus 56%, .062), but no difference in cancer-specific survival. Against the above round, only sublobar resection is recommended as an alternative to patients with insufficient lung function or pronounced comorbidity.",

      "text": "The North American CALGB140503 was presented at the WCLC in Vienna, in August 2022. For 697 randomized patients with tumour <2 cm, without pre- or perioperatively verified lymph node proliferation, sublobar resection (segmentctomy or kilexcision) was found to result in the same long-term survival as lobectomy (non-inferiority). These latest results thus seem to show that parenchymal surgery (preferably anatomical segmentctomy but also a large kicisilex) can be recommended in the first place to patients with good lung function and no comorbidity, provided the tumour is small (<2 cm) and lymph nodes are spread out. Anatomical segment resections are primarily used for tumor localization in the lingual segment and apical lower lobe segments, but may be performed on all segments as single resections, unisectomy, or in the form of bi- or trisegmental resections. A sleeve resection has traditionally been used for anatomically distant centrally growing tumors, such as carcinoids, as an alternative to conventional pulto It may also be used for other types of tumors with central extension in the bronchial sleeve or pulmonary artery (PA sleeves) to avoid lung metastases. In any surgical resection of lung cancer, a systematic exploration of the hillary and mediastinal lymph nodes should normally be carried out.

Atelectasis with complicated pneumonias as a result of immobilization or secretion is probably the most common complication after lung surgery. Postoperative mobilization and breathing training with e.g. the PEEP pipe are important preventive measures. At more severe secretions, bronchoscopic rubbing may be effective. Post-operative arthritis (usually pancreatic fibrosis) occurs in 330% of all operated patients. Prolactation or digitization was previously a standard method, but lack of anti-inflammatory effect is recommended if complete treatment of the problem occurs during the day and the risk of lung fission occurs between the lobar arteries. In case of doubt about the diagnosis, bronchoscopy may be helpful. The problem can be prevented with prophylactic pexia of the supra-movable lobe. Postoperative air leakage from alveolar sacrytor is common, but usually heals within a week with conservative treatment (pleural drainage and airway sanitization). In rare cases, reoperation is required. Post-operative bleeding requiring reoperation is seen in 12% of the operated cases. The bleeding can come from both resection area and lymphatic cortex lesions such as intercostal arteries and thoracic ducts. Bronchopulmonary fistula is today a rare but still feared complication associated with high morbidity but also mortality.

Chylothorax occurs more frequently after complete mediastinal lymph node clearance. It can usually be treated conservatively with MCT, fasting (with long-acting triglycerides) and/or as statin injections. Occasionally, reoperation may be needed with sealing of the leakage (if possible) or liquefaction of the ductus thoracicus. Postoperative pain is common, but may persist for up to a year after the opening of the parotid duct, which is less likely to occur within a month. Muscle-responsive thoracotomies are likely to produce less pain than postoperative lateral. Similarly, VATS surgery is associated with less pain in the early post-operative period, although most studies have not shown a decrease in the incidence of chronic so-called post-thoracotomy pain. These are believed to be largely due to intercostal muscle neuralgia. For chronic post-toracoatomy pain, there is very rarely a surgical cure and contact is recommended with a pain clinic or other pain-knowledgeable physician.

Patient survival has been difficult in all five clinical trials (89-115%) because the data on tumour-related adverse drug reactions have been higher than those reported in the previous five years [109] The first published study comparing conventional fractional radiation therapy and SBRT was the Swedish SPACE study, where there was no difference in efficacy but less toxicity and better quality of life in those receiving SBRT. There was also some imbalance in the groups in terms of prognostic factors that may have affected the outcome [116]. Neither did the LUSTRE study show any difference between SBRT and conventionally hypoglycaemic radiation treatment in survival but better numerical local control [117]. The ICHELIS study reported that SBRT provided better local survival control than conventionalized fractions therapy, but a relatively low proportion of patients did not receive radiation for longer than 50 years in the Gyldendron group [50]. Conventional fractionated radiotherapy should no longer be given to patients with T1-T2N0M0. Different fractionation patterns have been used internationally, but in Sweden 15 Gy given in three fractions to 45 Gy over a week is the most commonly used. The Swedish experience is based on the use of inhomogeneous dose distribution, where the dose per fraction in the periphery of the treatment area is 15 Gy and the dose centrally can amount to 22 Gy. Three fractions given every other day are biologically equivalent to doses above 100 Gy given with conventional Fractionation. Tumors suitable for this treatment should be locally limited and peripherally located and not close to a risk organ (ofesophagus, heart or bronchi). Centrally located tumors in the lung can be treated with a slightly lower fractional dose, and a phase II (HILUS) study for central tumors has been conducted in Sweden with the dosage of 7 x 56 Gy. [116 8] and a phase II study (HILUS) for central tumours has been conducted in Scandinavia with the dosage of 7 Gy x 8 to 56 Gy [116]. A good local control is found, but for ultracentral tumours with growth into or very close to central bronchi, 12% fatal bleeding was seen and for that group a more fractionated treatment is recommended e.g. 2.75 Gy x 20 to 55 Gy. Due to the good results regarding toxicity and local tumour control with SBRT, several attempts have been made to compare SBRT with surgery, but the studies have often had problems with slow inclusion and are equally intermittent. A pooled analysis of data from two studies is published, and it is seen that the survival is slightly better for patients treated with SBERT while the control is local [120], and in a prospective series of surgeries comparable to SBRT no difference could be seen [121]. Patients with tumours larger than 3 cm2 (T2) are reasonably tolerated and patients are offered chemotherapy even after surgery. It seems reasonable that even inoperable patients with T2 tumours who are judged to tolerate chemotherapy should be offered this after SBRT.",

Targeted locations involving the chest wall, involving bronchi, the inferior ipsilateral hilus, and the primary paratrakeal (respectively, the 10th and 11th stations), can also be depended on the left paracranial glands [156, 1565, 1566, and 1567, respectively.

Current patients should be operable (see section 9.10 Preoperative function evaluation) often with the addition of pulmonary imaging, at least for patients where pulmonatectomy is relevant), have resectable primary tumors (T13) and have minimal N2 disease, i.e. single N2 (< 3 cm). In Sweden, trimedal treatment has been used mainly in Lund with very low treatment-related mortality even in pulmonitectomies [164] and good survival for this selected patient group. Preoperatively the patient selectively receives 4450 Gynecomastia and lymphatic platelets engaged against the tumour (frequently associated with electrocardiograms and also often associated with short-term radiation therapy) and negative effect on the plasma volume (including 7 + 4 volumes of cytometry). Radiochemotherapy often adversely affects gas exchange and ergospirometry including DLCO, pulmonary imaging and FDG-PET is repeated towards the end of radiotherapy. Provided that patients are still operable and not progressing in their tumour disease, the patient is operated on within approximately 4 weeks, before a possible radiation pneumonitis is diagnosed. If the tumour is suspected to have progressed locally and is not resectable, radiation therapy is continued up to a final dose of 6068 Gy.",

      "text": "There are currently five preparations with this indication  gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, dakomitinib and osimertinib. Gefitinib and erlotitinib have been associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS) in randomised trials compared to conventional cytostatic therapy in previously untreated patients [211], whereas overall survival has not been extended, likely due to a crossover, where many patients receiving primary cytostatic therapy at a later stage are likely to receive ECFRT. There are likely no differences in efficacy between these three preparations, even though few of these preparations are directly comparable to Afinitinib. The median PFS was 11.0 and 10.9 months respectively (H 0.73 [0.570.95]; p = 0.0165) [212], whereas OS was not significantly prolonged with tactic at, ka ller K, e ns in nad nter KI. at, s HR d [213] Dakomitinib, which together with afatinib is usually included in the 2nd generation EGFRKI T, was associated with prolonged PFS compared to gefitinib (mPFS 14.7 and 9.2 months; HR 0.590,470.74]; p < 0.0001) [214] and prolonged OS (mOS 26.1 and HR 34.8 months; [150,990.584]; the study did not include CNS patients [214]. Osimertinib, a 3rd generation EGFR TKI, was first introduced for relapse therapy in treatment failure of the 1st/2nd generation EGFTR TKI and detected resistance mutation T790M in the EGFR gene (see below), but has subsequently been extended to include 1st line therapy in activating EGFR mutations, and has recently also been approved for adjuvant therapy following surgery (see section 14.1.1.1.1). Prolonged PFS was also seen in patients with CNS metastases, which could be included in this study. A subsequent follow-up of the FLAURA study also showed prolonged overall survival with osimertinib compared to gefitinib and erlotinib. Median OS was 38.6 and 31.8 months, respectively; HR 0.80 [0.641.00]; p = 0.046 [217]. Neither dakomitinib nor Osimertinib has been directly compared with afatinib. Based on these data, both dakomatinib and osimertanib would offer treatment advantages over the 1st generation EGFR-TKI in previously treated patients with activating EGFR mutations. Osimertnib has been associated with the longest duration of PFS in combination with prolonged total survival in reported studies, and has also had beneficial effects with the CNS-metastases as well. However, the most common cause of treatment failure is the development of obesity and obesity in patients treated with the best sequence of treatment, the TFR-MKI on generation 1:90a. In case of treatment failure on osimertinib, the mechanisms of resistance are more complex, and established treatment alternatives in addition to conventional cytostatic therapy are often lacking. Therefore, the recommendation is to initiate treatment with one of the preparations amongst the 2nd and 3rd generation EGFR-TKI, while the 1st generation TKI gefitinib and erlotinib can be considered as alternatives for intolerance to other preparations. However, evaluation of several new preparations is ongoing for both antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Amivantamab, an antibody that binds to both EGFR and MET, received EMA approval in December 2021 for the treatment of patients with insertion mutations in EGFR exon 20 after treatment failure on platinum-based cytostatic therapy. The approval is based on an ickerandomised phase I/II study (CHRYSALIS) that included 114 patients with advanced NSCLC and activating insert mutation in EGRF exon 2025. 308 patients were randomised to treatment with amivantamab + platinum-based cytostatics (n=153) vs. cytostatic alone (n = 155). The results showed a longer PFS with the combination therapy. The median PFS was 11.4 months on amiventamab+ cytostats vs. 6.7 months on cytostates alone (HR 0.40 [0.3053]; P< 0.001). The proportion of patients who survived 18 months without disease progression was 31% vs. 3% at the primary indication of OS at the time of the first NSCLC analysis. In a 3-arm phase III study, MARIPOSA [219], 1074 patients with an EGFR mutation Ex19del or L858R were randomised to primary treatment with amivantamab + lazertinib, a 3rd generation EGFR-TKI (n=429), lasertinib alone (n = 216) or osimertinib (n=\"429\"). Primary mortality outcome was PFS in comparison to amantamib + Osimertinib vs. laser. months with amivantamab + lazertinib vs. 16.6 months with osimertinib (HR 0.70 [0.580.85]; p< 0.001). The results are promising, but do not lead to a treatment recommendation at this time, as amiventamab is not yet indicated. In addition, lazertanib is not available for prescription. Mobocertinib is an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has shown efficacy in activating insertion mutations in exon 20. The preparation has been studied in both the first and second line, but is not approved for this indication. In the autumn of 2023 the preparation will be discontinued by responsible pharmaceutical companies. The decision is based on negative results in an as yet unpublished study of mobocertnib vs. platinum-based chemotherapy (EXIMCLA-2).",

The combination therapy was associated with prolonged PFS (mPFS 20.9 and 11.2 months; HR 0.49 [0.390.62]) and OS (mOS 52.2 and 38.8 months;HR 0.69 [0.520.92]). However, the indication is not EMA approved. The proportion of patients who were alive without tumour progression at 24 months was 57% and 41%, respectively. OS data were immature at the time of the primary analysis, with similar results for both treatment options. The studies point to potential therapeutic benefits also with 3rd generation EGFR-TKI in combination with cytostatics, but currently do not constitute a basis for generally recommending combination therapy with EGFR TKI + cytostatic over EGFR -TKI alone as standard therapy in EGFR mutated NSCLC. Combination therapy with erlotinib and bevacizumab, an angiogenic inhibitor (see below), has been investigated in a Japanese randomised phase II study in previously untreated patients with active ECFR mutations [223]. The study showed a PFS benefit to combination therapy comparable to erlotzumab alone (HRP 16.4 months and HRP 9.8 months, respectively; follow-up data with OSF  0.52 and 0.7 months respectively) [224]. However, no similar benefit of combination therapy has been observed in the Japanese phase III study with ERlotinib. The combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab has also been investigated in a Japanese randomised Phase III study with a similar design. An interim analysis observed prolonged PFS with the combination compared to errotinib alone (mPFS 16.9 and 13.3 months respectively; HR 0.60 [0.420.88]) [225]. However, the median follow-up time was only 12.4 months, and OS data were immature. European data are available from a non-controlled Phase II study [226], where the combination of Erlotinib with bevazizumab achieved a median PFS of 13.2 months. The indication for the combination erlutinib + bevavizumab is EMA-approved. However, combination therapy with be vacizumabe and 2nd or 3rd generation EGFRTKI offered therapies have not been studied. The combination of bevacizumab and osimertinib has been studied in two randomised Phase II studies in susceptible EGFR mutations (Ex19del or L858R) in the 1st line [227] and the EGFR T790M mutation in the 2nd line [228], in both cases without PFS benefits compared to Osimertinib alone.",

      "text": "Therapeutic resistance to EGFR-TKIs occurs sooner or later, usually within one to two years of initiation of therapy. The most common mechanism of resistance in treatment with 1st or 2nd generation EGFR TKIs is the emergence of a new T790M mutation in exon 20 of the EGFR gene, which is seen in 50 to 60% of patients. Other mechanisms include MET or HER2 amplification, PIK3CA rearrangement, BRAF or KRAS mutations, and morphological transformation into small cell cancers. Therapiresistance to treatment with osimertinib may be associated with a range of molecular genetic mechanisms, with a point mutation C797S in the exon of the 20 ECFR gene being one of the more common (approximately 16%) [229]. Alternative tumor progression inhibitors are therefore recommended by reanalysis of tumour tissue and renal biopsy of the tumour pathway as an alternative to treatment for plasma analysis. In a randomised phase III study (AURA 3), clear treatment benefits of osimertinib were observed compared to platinum-based cytostatic therapy (cisplatin/ carboplatin + pemetrexed) in the current situation [230]. Osimertinib was associated with higher overall response rate (ORR) of 71% and 31%, respectively, and longer PFS (mFSP 10.2 and 4.4 months; HR 0.30 [0.230.41]; pFS < 0.0001), as well as a higher proportion of CNS responses (70% and 31% respectively) and longer CNS response time (CNSP 11.7 and 5.6 months, respectively). The possibility of including patients in clinical trials should always be considered. In 2023, the results of a randomised Phase III study (MARIPOSA-2) of amivantamab, an antibody against EGFR and MET (see above) were published in addition to cytostatics in the event of treatment failure on osimertinib [231]. 657 patients with EGFR-mutated (Ex19 or L858R) NSCLC and tumour progression during osimertinib were randomised to treatment with amiventamab or without (lazertab) + cytostatic alone or cytostatics alone. Results showed a prolonged PFS for amivantamab, with or without lazertinib, in addition to cytostatics vs. cytostatic alone; median PFS was 6.3 months with amiventamab + cytostats, 8.3 months on amivintamab+lazertinib + cytostatics, and 4.2 months on cytostates alone (HR 0.48 [0.36-0.64] and HR 0.44 [0.35-0.56] respectively; p< 0.001).",

Ceritinib and brigitinib are also authorised in the event of treatment failure of krizitinib, whereas lorletinib is approved in the case of therapy failure of prior treatment with ceritinibs or alektinibs or krizinb plus another ALK-TKI (see below). Crizotinib was compared in a Phase III study (PROFILE 1014) with platinum + pemetrexed (without maintenance therapy), and resulted in higher rates of tumour remission (ORR 74% and 41% respectively) and longer PFS (mPFS 10.9 and 7.0 months; HR 0.45 [0.350.60]; p < 0.001) [232]. In the global study, the median PFS was 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with krizotinib (HR 0.43 [0.320.58]). Patients with CNS metastases also had a longer PFS with alektinib at baseline (27.7 and 7.4 months, respectively), and the time to CNS progression was significant (HR longer [160.100.281]; the total incidence of both tumours was similar between 0.5% and 7.5% (and 0.9 and 0.5% respectively). Brigatinib has also been studied in a comparative study (ALTA-1L) with krizotinib in the control arm in previously untreated patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. Results from an interim analysis show treatment advantages for brigatinib with respect to PFS (12 months PFS 67%, 43%, HR 0.490, [0.330,  74] p < 0.001) and higher proportion of CNS responses (78% vs 29% vs 29%) in patients treated with alectinib (HR 0.67 [0.46 0.98]).

The conclusion is that both krizotinib and ceritinib are more effective than cytostatics and that alectinib, brigatinib and lorletinib are more efficient than crizotinib in terms of progression free survival (before alektinib is also given long overall survival) and CNS control (the latter is likely to also apply to cerotinib, although direct comparison of the data is recommended overall in first-line alectatinib, brigutinib or lorlotinib, whereas in patients previously untreated with ALK-positive NSCLC and patients intolerant to other preparations, treatment with ALKI is assessed as having no clinical benefit per day for the treatment of patients with intolerance to other medicinal products).",

The sensitivity of ALK-TKIs to different mutations has been investigated in preclinical studies, but the predictive value of different ALK mutations for treatment effects in vivo is poorly validated. However, in case of therapy failure on ALK TKIs, re-opening of the tumor for new molecular genetic analysis, or analysis of circulating DNA in plasma (ctDNA) may be considered, which may guide further treatment. All five registered ALK-TKIs are approved in the relapse therapy indication for ALK positive NSCLC: krizotinib in patients previously treated with UNS (meaning first-line cytostatic therapy, which at the time of approval was also first line therapy for ALC-positive NSCTC), ceritinib, alektinib and brigatinib in patients formerly treated by krizotnib, and lorlatinib in those patients previous to treatment with either krizotanib plus another ALK TKI, or received cerbitinib or alectinib as first line of treatment. The indications for cerbotinib and alectitinib are mainly based on two randomised trials (ALCE-5 and ALCE-51) comparing the preparations with cytostatics in patients who had previously received both crizotinib and cytostatinib [240, 241]. In both cases, prolonged PFS was observed with ALK-TKI: 5.4 and 1.6 months for ceritinib (HR 0.49 [0.360.60]; p < 0.0001), and 9.6 and 1.4 months for alectinib (HR0.15 [0.080.29]; p< 0.001), respectively, and a higher proportion of CNS responses: 35% and 5% for Ceritinib and 54.2% and 0% for Alectinib, respectively. The study included 229 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC (plus 47 who were ROS1-positive), all but 30 of whom had been previously treated with at least one ALK TKI. The rate of tumour response was 90% in previously untreated patients and 47% in patients who had previously received at least 1 ALKTKI.The rate of objective CNS response was 67% (2/3) and 63% (51/81) respectively. Overall, there are currently several treatment options for treatment failure on previous ALK-TKIs. The sequence of ALK TKIs that offers optimal disease control and survival is insufficiently studied. In case of tumour progression during treatment with krizotinib, treatment switching to ceritinib, alektinib or brigatinib should be considered. In patients with treatment failure with ceritinib, alettinib or Brigatinib, whether administered in the first or second line, lorlatinib should be contemplated. When further treatment with ALK -TKI is not considered to be of benefit to the patient, conventional cytostatic therapy should be envisaged.",

RET fusions are seen in 12% of patients with N SCLC. The activity of multikinase inhibitors, such as kabozantinib, vandetanib, sunitinib, sorafenib and alektinib, has varied in early studies with response rates ranging from 16 to 47%. Pralsetinib is a more specific RET inhibitor that was recently approved for treatment in patients with RET-fusion-positive advanced NSCSCLC who have not previously been treated with an RET blocker. Intracranial response was seen in 5/9 patients with CNS metastases. Pralsetinib is available for subsidised prescription but is likely to be deregistered for use in Europe in the autumn of 2024. This is not based on lack of efficacy but on the transfer of the marketing authorisation to other pharmaceutical companies that do not intend to continue marketing the preparation in Europe. Selperkatinib is another novel RET inhibitor which in Phase I/II studies (LIBRETTO-001) resulted in a response rate of 64% in patients with RET infusion-positive advanced NSCLC and previous cytostatic therapy, and 85% in previously untreated patients [250]. Based on the above, treatment with pralsetinib or selperkatinib is recommended in RET-fusion-positive advanced NSCLC in patients who have not previously received a RET inhibitor. Of the MET-blender variants, mutations driving MET exon 14 (MET ex1 skipping) and MET capping have been identified as driving mechanisms in NSC with potential and targeted therapy (HR 0.46 [0.310.70]; p < 0.001). Newer MET inhibitors include capmatinib and tepotinib. Kapmatinib received EMA approval in 2022 for the treatment of patients with NSCLC and METex14 skipping who were previously treated with immunotherapy and/ or platinum-based cytostatics. The approval is based on the results of a Phase II study (GEOMETRY) that showed response rates of 41% in formerly treated patients (n=69) and 68% in previously untreated patients (N=28) [253]. METex14 skipping mutation in patients with advanced NSCLC previously treated with immunotherapy and/ or platinum-based cytostatics. The approval is based on data from a phase II study (VISION) that showed response rates of 56% (trier evaluation) and 46% (independent evaluation), respectively, in 99 patients with METEX14 skipped mutation, of whom 56 had received prior systemic therapy [254]. Tepotinib is available for general subsidised prescription from 1 May 2023. Based on the above, we see both kapmatinib and tepotinib as potential treatment alternatives in patients who are progressing to other systemic therapies with advanced MECLC and METEx14-skipping mutations. In 2023, trastuzumab-deruxtecane was approved in the indication advanced NSCLC with activating HER2 mutation and requiring systemic treatment following platinum-based chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy.

Immunotherapy with antibodies against PD-1 and PD-L1 in advanced NSCLC was introduced into clinical practice in 2015, initially as relapse therapy for tumour progression following cytostatic therapy, then also in previously untreated patients. There are currently five antibody (s) to PD-1/PD-L1, which are approved for treatment of advanced NCSLC: PD-1-acetate nivolumab, pembrolizumab and cemiplimab, and PD1-acetozolizumabe and durvalumab.

Durvalumab is also approved for adjuvant therapy after chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced N SCLC, and is discussed in Chapter 13 Radiation therapy (see also above in the section on Drug Treatment in Radiotherapy). In March 2023, an EMA approved indication was added to durbalumab in conjunction with tremelimunab, an CTLA4 agent, and a platinum based cytostatic agent in advanced N ScLC.

The indication is based on a Phase III study (IMpower110), in which 572 previously untreated patients with advanced NSCLC underwent treatment with atezolizumab or cytotoxic agents [262]. In the patient group with EGFR- and ALK-negative tumours and the highest PD-L1 expression in the tumour (see above; n=205) in the primary analysis, the survival of atezolidumab as monotherapy in line 1 was compared to the median age of 13.2 months vs. 20.2 months (median PHR=0.590, PHR = 0.010, PFS=0.830, PHS=0.459), and in the subgroup of patients with ECFR/ ALK negative tumours with the highest tumour PD-l1 expression (see n=20.5) the survivorship with atezumab versus cytotoctic agents was â¥ 50% in tumour cells or â¥ 10% in tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In an updated survival analysis with approximately three years of follow-up, the median survival was 20.2 versus 14.7 months, and the survival gain with atezolizumab was no longer statistically significant (HR 0.76 [0.541.09]) [263]. Recently, cemiplimab was also approved for monotherapy in the 1st line of the corresponding indication, i. e. advanced NSCLC with PD-L1-expression â¥ 50% in tumour cells. The study included 710 previously untreated patients, and showed a survival gain in patients receiving cemiplimab. median survival was not achieved at the time of analysis with cemiplimab vs. 14.2 months with cytostatics (HR 0.57 [0.420.77]; p=0.0002), and median PFS 8.2 vs. 5.7 months (HR 0,54 [0.43-0.68]). In KEYNOTE-189, 616 patients with NSCLC other than squamous cell carcinoma, and without EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement, were randomised to induction therapy with cisplatin/ carboplatin plus pemetrexed combined with either pembrolizumab or placebo, followed by maintenance treatment with pemetrexet in combination with pembrolizeumab and placebo [266-268] The study showed a clear survival benefit with the pembrolizaumab combination compared to the placebo combination (i. e. cytotoxic alone). In KEYNOTE-407, 559 patients with squamous cell carcinoma were randomised to induction therapy with carboplatin plus paclitaxel/ nab-paclitaxel in combination with pembrolizumab or placebo, followed by maintenance therapy with either Pembrolizumab or placebo [269, 270]. In the IMpower 130 study [271], 724 patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with atezolizumab in combination with cytostatics (carboplatin plus paclitaxel) for 46 cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with atezumab, or solely cytostatic 4 6 cycles followed by treatment with pemetrexed (sch) or B. Primary endpoint survival was observed in patients without ALK mutations, or in patients with ALK type disorders, even if these patients were in the study. Based on the IMpower 130 results, atezolizumab has an approved indication for combination therapy with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel in first-line metastatic NSCLC other than squamous cell carcinoma, and not ECFR- or ALK-positive. In the IMpower150 study [272] 1,202 patients were randomised to one of three treatment arms: 1) induction therapy with atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel (ACP) followed by maintenance therapy with Atezolizumab, 2) induction therapies with bevacizumab, carboplatin, and pacitaxel (BCP), followed by maintaining therapy with Bevacigab, or 3) induction Therapy with atezumab, combined with BCP (ABCP) following by maintenance treatment with BCCP and atezazumab.

There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend any of the treatment options over the others, as direct comparative data are lacking. In situations where a rapid response is sought, e. g. in rapidly progressing tumours and/ or affecting central structures of the thorax, combination therapy with cytostatics and immunotherapy may be likely to be justified in preference to monotherapy if the patient is able to do so. â¢ Pembrolizumab is given for squamous cell carcinoma as induction therapy in combination with carboplatin + paclitaxel/ nabpaclitaxel, followed by maintenance therapy with pembrolizaumab, and for another histological type in conjunction with platinum + pemetrexed, followed up by maintenance treatment with Pembrolizimab + Pemetrexed. â¢ Atezolizumabe is given in non-squamous cells cancer as combination induction treatment with carboplatin and nabpoclitaxel followed by continuation of treatment with atezolizeumab in combination, and kept in place with nabclitaxel during maintenance therapy. in combination with carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab, followed by maintenance therapy with atezolizumab or bevazizumab; the latter combination may also be administered to patients with EGFR mutations or ALK fusions if they have first received treatment with the EGFR and ALK TKIs, respectively. â¢ Cemiplimab is given in NSCLC as an induction therapy in conjunction with a platinum-based cytostatic agent, selected on histological grounds, followed up by maintenance treatment with cemiplimab, and, where appropriate, also pemetrexed. The indication is limited to patients with â¥ 1% PD-L1 expression in tumour cells. â¢ Iplilimumab + nivolumab is given in combination with a platinum-based cytostatic agent, selected for histological reasons, over two treatment cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with ipilimumabe + nivulumab. â¢ Atezolizumab monotherapy is a treatment option in patients with NSCLC and PD- L1 expression â¥ 50% in tumor cells or â¥ 10% in tumor infiltrating cells. In all of the above immunotherapy studies, only patients with ECOG/ WHO performance status (PS) 0 or 1 were included. Whether survival gains can also be achieved in populations with PS 2 or worse has not been studied. Therefore, the above recommendation applies primarily to patients with PS 0 or 1, but may also be considered in selected cases with PS 2. The most recent meta-analysis of randomized trials is based on 2,714 patients from 16 randomized studies of cytotoxic agents [276].The analysis shows a significant increase in survival with chemotherapy compared to best supportive care (HR 0.77 [0.710.83]; p < 0.0001).This corresponds to an absolute increase in 1-year survival from 20% to 29%.At the group level, treatment also has positive effects on health-related quality of life.There is currently no standard regimen for first-line cytotoctic treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer.A combination of cisplatin and any of the preparations vinorbinel, docetaxel, paclitaxel, gemcitabine or pemetrexed appears to have similar effects on survival and quality of Life based on published controlled studies. albumin bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) in combination with carboplatin in a phase III study in advanced NSCLC resulted in a higher rate of remissions and less neurotoxicity compared to solution-based paclitaxil and carboplattin in the control arm, while progression-free and overall survival was similar for both combinations [277]. advanced non-small cell lung cancer showed marginal benefits for cisplatin with respect to survival effects in subgroups of patients [278]. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy should be selected when prolonged survival is the primary treatment objective (particularly patients in WHO performance status 0 or 1), and as an adjunct to surgery or radiotherapy when the intention of treatment is curative. Whether cis platin confers treatment benefits over carboplatin when combined with cytostatic therapy with immunotherapy has not been studied. The optimal duration of 1st-line cytostatic therapy in non-Small Cell Lung Cancer has been investigated in several comparative studies. Meta-analyses of these have shown no assured survival gains with more than 4 cycles of the same regimen of treatment, whereas progression-free survival increases by several cycles [279-281]. Simultaneous toxicity was observed with longer treatment durations. However, for a preparation  pemetrexed , maintenance therapy is an approved indication in patients who have not progressed during induction therapy with a platinum-based cytostatic regimen, and in whom the histological picture is not dominated by squamous cell carcinoma. Survival gains with induction chemotherapy followed by maintenance therapy with pemeterexed compared to induction alone have been demonstrated in two large randomised trials [282, 283]. An objection to the design of these trials is the lack of significant structured treatment at progression, which may have contributed to poorer survival in controls.

The basis for recommending bevazizumab in general in non-small cell lung cancer is therefore weak, although the formal indication for the preparation does not have this limitation.

Tumor treatment with palliatives intention is fundamentally different from a curative intentioned therapy. In the curative situation, we can expose patients to various side effects as the benefits can be great and the disease can be prolonged. Since the risks of the palliations have to be limited by botryotic treatment or by improving the quality of the treatment, it is important to include end-of-life surgical treatment, as well as prolongation of life. It is important to emphasise that good palliation can include surgery, radiation, cytostatic treatment and various forms of endobronchial treatment.

The mechanism of opioid action is not fully understood, reduced susceptibility to hypernia is a possible secondary mechanism.

Vocal cord paralyzes also often cause impaired swallowing function with the risk of mis-swallowing and impaired power when coughing. If the vocal cordparalysis persists or does not return with the tumour treatment, mediation of the paired voicing, e.g. by injection of hyaluronic acid, can be of great value. This is usually carried out via flexible fibroscopy in local practice, but can also be done under anaesthesia. If the breathing difficulties are severe, a tracheostomy may need to be performed, or a so-called laterofixation (where one vocal cord is pulled to the side) or similar procedures may be performed to create a larger opening between the vocal cords and reduce respiratory resistance.

Recurrent hemoptysis is another problem. Symptomatic stenosis of the central airways reduces the expected survival in the disease. If the stasis is repaired, there are data suggesting that mortality will be the same as for other lung cancer patients at the same stage.[319] Obstruction of the airways can often be due to tumor diseases other than lung cancer. The following applies regardless of the primary tumor type. Benign obstructions are not described here. Isolated stenoses/occlusions of the bronchial lobes or smaller lobes are not meaningful except when addressed in situations of increased risk of tumors and outgrowth of head tumors, as well as post-replaced pneumotomies (stones of the upper lobe of the lungs), or recurrent pneumonia. Endobronchial therapy of airway obstruction involves a number of techniques. Intrabronchial interventions may be performed with diathermy, cryotherapy, YAG lasers or argon plasma coagulation (APC). Endobronic therapy also uses various types of stents made of silicone or metal (covered and uncovered). Radiation therapy involves the application of an intra- bronchial radiation source for the local treatment of a thoracic or intra- peripheral peritoneum. Endoboronchial treatment involves removing the bronchi from the head of the tumour and facilitates the evacuation of the patient, preferably with the aid of a bronchoscopy. This means that the procedure is performed in an operating room, preferably with access to thoracic surgical expertise; however, minor procedures with diathermy and/ or cryotherapy may be performed under local anaesthesia with the patient awake.",

Silicone stents are most tissue-friendly and are currently the only option for placing a Y-stent over the carina that is removable. However, the technique is more difficult than for covered metal stents. Silicon stents have a slightly higher risk of migration compared to other stents; silicone stent is preferred for patients with benign causes of obstruction and long survival expectancy. Covered metal stenting is easy to insert and the procedure can be performed intuitively on the patient's prepared bronchoscopy if the stent has been removed. These stents do not have the same resistance to tissue as silicon stents, and there is an extra layer of air that is somewhat more difficult to remove. There are Y-stents which are partially covered.

Sectal secretion may in some cases lead to occlusion of the Stent with dyspnoea as a consequence.

Sector secretionality can be prevented with 5 x 4 ml cocaine inhalations daily for the first few weeks after stenting. The patient should have contact with physiotherapists regarding PEP and head blocking. However, granulation may occur especially in patients with metastatic stents, and symptoms may also occur when metastasis is relieved with silicone granulation therapy or laser dialysis. In case of troublesome symptoms, the granulation tissue can be resected with diathermy or laser. Perforation is a dreaded complication, especially seen after placement of uncovered metal teeth. Bleeding and fistulas to the oesophagus or mediastinum may result. There are thus several potentially serious complications to stent treatment.

The content of the chapter can be roughly summarised in the following points: â¢ Lung cancer affects life on both a symbolic/existential level and a practical/everyday level. How individual patients interpret and manage their life situation depends on their socio-cultural and life history context. â¢ In threatening situations, people instinctively seek relationship with the person/institution that can help, in the case of severe illness, healthcare is one such instance. â¢ In threatening situations, people instinctively seek a relationship with the person/authority who can help, in severe illness, healthcare is one such authority. A good relationship with healthcare therefore creates security in a difficult life situation. â¢ This is facilitated by the fact that healthcare acts as a 'safe haven' or 'helpful plan', in concrete terms, that medical teams and individual care providers strive to convey expertise, continuity, commitment and respect to the patient. â¢ Patients' preferences for information and their availability vary and can change over time. Therefore, information can both facilitate and complicate depending on whether it is adapted to the current situation, wishes and needs of the patient; â¢ Giving specific preparation and intake that is tailor-made to the individual patient, and focusing on the patient's situation, needs and desires. â¢ Knowing that each day is central and difficult to live for, even patients who are sick will soon try to move on with their lives. â¢ Patients should be systematically and regularly asked whether they are interested in contact with other patients, whether they want to talk to them about their illness, or whether they would like to have a conversation with them.",

We humans tend to take our existence and well-being for granted while illness, catastrophes and death are seen as distant risks. Suffering from a serious illness therefore challenges the imagined life-line of the vast majority of patients, a confrontation with death that is not contained in what one has imagined to face in life, at least not in the usual time-frame. In general, lung cancer involves challenges and losses of various kinds, physical, social, psychological and existential [326]. How individuals interpret and deal with their new life situation and which resources to mobilise are characterised by the socio-cultural and life-historical context the person is in (for example, past life experiences and cultural belonging) [327].

Information can be both deceptive and embarrassing depending on how the patient adapts to the current situation, [33] and the patient has different needs and attitudes to information and does not want to know all the information, while at the same time balancing the need for autonomy with the desire to know and balance all the other information. The challenge is to provide information while managing/balancing the patient's hope and autonomy.[335] The physician should inform in a way that leaves mental space for the patients own way of dealing with their vulnerability/situation. Provide an estimate of severity, some patients ask further while others are not yet able to handle more detailed information but may need to return later with clarifying questions.

There is therefore no uniform model for which psychosocial interventions patients need and it is also difficult to rank them. The National Health Care Programme for Cancer Rehabilitation makes a breakdown of basic, special, advanced and very advanced needs. Basic rehabilitation needs should be primarily met by doctors and contact nurses while other needs are met by team sessions or special rehabilitation teams. However, how the demarcation between different levels of rehabilitation is done in practice is not entirely clear. Therefore, healthcare professionals need to be sensitive to the needs and expectations of the patient and what they want to achieve with the help of this patient's own needs or to the competence that a member of the rehabilitation team should be able to provide with these needs [345]. In the case of lung cancer, it is common for patients to undergo emotional experiences of loss, despair, anxiety and fear [338]. This may take different forms, some find it difficult to articulate themselves in the midst of the crisis, while others find it easier to put their experiences into words. With regard to psychological treatment it is difficult to know which patients are suitable for it. At least it does not seem to be sufficient to identify patients via screening instruments that read the colour. Studies suggest that one in five patients wishes for professional psychological help but this is not clear in relation to the level of anxiety/depression indicated [346]. Thus it seems to be a different matter when a patient wishes to communicate with a professional and has a simple way of communicating. the question of whether the patient (or relative) is interested in a conversation with a counsellor or psychologist and offers to facilitate contact. This question can be asked regularly, not only when the patient shows crisis and grief reactions, as it is ultimately about the patient's own motivation and readiness to receive help. The curator is the member of the team who specifically represents and focuses on the psychosocial perspective of cancer care. The main task of the Curator is to work to promote the living conditions of patients and relatives. In short, it is about offering the opportunity to psychologically engage in life coaching and being a link to community efforts in more complex social needs.",

The period of illness sometimes gives reason and time to reflect on this and some take the opportunity to sort out various difficulties in life. Although it does not seem obvious that when it comes to health care, we must be aware of the patient's responsibilities and we can facilitate and assist the patient during the course of research, even if it is possible to reduce the overall burden of psychological treatment, by helping to understand the relationship between the patient and the disease [349]. Contemporary research on psychological treatment emphasizes the importance of the relationship between the patient and the helper [349]. A trusting relationship, a working alliance, with a professional who is genuinely interested in understanding and helping is the very basis of all psychologically oriented change work. The framing of the conversations also matters, that there is a time set aside in seclusion, and further to convey that help is available and a consensus on how this should be done. In an established dialogue relationship, it is important to socratically listen and wonder together with the patient about what the despair is, what its meaning and consequence is for the person. Respectfully turning and turning on the experience can be a way to de-dramatize. The open reflection therefore conveys acceptance and security. The reflective approach can also be combined with more structured interventions. Although the curator has the most prominent role in psychosocial issues, all staff in cancer care have a psychological meaning for patients. Sometimes there is a special contact between a team member and the patient that seems to have a helping or therapeutic significance for the patient.",

Carcinoids are often seen as well-defined tumours, sometimes with pointed or diffuse calcifications. At central localization atelectasis may occur. If improved liver diagnosis is needed, 3-phase DT should alternatively be performed by MRI. FDG-PET, which is often done for the diagnosis of peripheral 'round hardness' in the lungs, has a dubious value for the staging of diagnosed bronchial carcinoid. Instead, the fact that a majority of bronchial carcinoids (up to 80%) express somatostatin receptors can be exploited. A 68Ga-DOTA-TOC or 68Ga - DOTA-TATE PET/DT should be performed prior to treatment in the case of suspected metastatic disease for staging and assessment of the expression of the somatostatine receptor [354] and can then also be used for follow-up and relapse assessment. In small primary typical carcinoid carcinomas with no other suspicion of metastasis, the added value of the PET / DT is limited [355]. Bronchoscopy is the most important method for the pre-diagnosis of central tumors. Bronchial cancer is often seen as a vascular, smooth-lobed tumor. If the sample is taken centrally, it is not possible to verify the risk of blood sampling in the diagnosis of cancer from other forms of lung cancer, but the risk is greater than in earlier stages of development. in the case of bronchial carcinoid sampling has been noted in the past, but is not greater than in other forms of centrally growing lung cancer. In planned surgery, it is important to document the proximal boundary of the tumor in the bronchus, preferably with photography. Serological sampling of chromogranin A may be considered, although the evidence for use in bronch carcinoids has been questioned in recent times [355]. Chromogranin levels may be used in follow-up as a marker for disease spread (such as in metastatic disease). In other cases, sampling in symptomatic tumors is warranted, and includes 5-HIAA and sometimes Sortisol and ACTH.

Chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy may be considered for locoregionally advanced inoperable atypic carcinoid. Preoperative cytostatic therapy may be contemplated in isolated cases of atypically advanced carcinoma, where a reduction in tumour mass is judged to improve the chances of complete resection. Systemic therapy with chemotherapy or other pharmacological treatment is appropriate in metastatic progressive disease. In asymptomatic disease and very long-term growth, consideration may be given to expending regular follow-up. Because bronchial carcinomas are uncommon, relatively few randomised studies exist to support treatment choices for carcinoides, and in most cases we recommend the selection of treatment regimens based on results from a small proportion of cases where the cancer is derived from different organs of the bronchi. For functional tumours, systemic therapy is used to control hormonal symptoms. Somatostatin analogues (SSAs) such as octreotide or lanothireotide are well established as part of symptom control in carcinoid syndrome. Other targeted therapy is required in rarer forms such as Cushing's syndrome. SSAs may also be considered as the first line of therapy for tumour prevention purposes such as bronchodilator-receptor-resistant, particularly in low tumour proliferation index studies [351, 358]. Prospective data on bronchial carcinoids are available from the LUNA study (see below) while the randomised SPINET study has been prematurely closed due to low inclusion rate (not yet published). When used for antiproliferative purposes, a full dose should be given, i. e. octreotide 30 mg or alternatively lanotereid 120 mg every 4 weeks. Everolimus, an oral mTOR inhibitor, is the medicinal product that currently has the best formal evidence-based data from the RADIANT 4 study, a Phase III study that included approximately 300 patients with 90 bronchioles [362].",

The results could be reproduced, at least numerically, in an exploratory subgroup analysis of 44 patients with bronchial carcinoid [365], where patients receiving everolimus (n = 33) had a PFS of 13.6 months compared to 5.6 months in patients received only octreotide (n=11, HR 0.77; p = 0.23). Temozolomide has gained more prominence in recent years and is studied in several ickerandomised studies, with a response rate of up to 30% of cases and with a modest adverse reaction profile [358]. [369] It is usually given 150-200 mg/ m2 orally daily for 5 days every 4 weeks. In studies of combination therapies containing temozolomide [370-372] with bevacizumab and thalidomide, the effect was comparable to temozlomide in monotherapy and has not been recommended in capecinoid therapy and has also been studied better than in a prospective study in combination with bronchopneumonia [373] [374].

The application areas have been many (e.g. fire protection, thermal insulation, noise reduction, reinforcement, as chalk and insulation in floor and tile laying and as an ingredient in paints and plasters). Due to the carcinogenic properties of asbestos, a ban first against the most dangerous asbesto fibers was introduced in Sweden in 1975 and since then a total ban in 1982. In exposed individuals, inhaled asbestose fibers can be trapped in the distal portions of the lungs and in the pleura. 80 to 90% of cases of mesothelioma in Swedish men could be attributed to previous exposure to asbestos, mostly occupational, 30 to 50 years earlier. However, in the case of Swedish women, such exposure was found only in 20 to 30% of cases. Exactly what the situation looks like today (more than 40 years after the ban) is more unclear.

Drop metastases to the pleura, often dorsally, are not uncommon in thymomas. Computed tomography (CT) is the basis for diagnosis and usually detects a characteristic change at the site of the thymus. CT detects disease at stage 4A (pleural spread) and 4B (extracal spread), but the method is not considered to be reliable in determining the degree of invasiveness in local disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rarely provides additional information in this regard. Occasionally, echocardiography, pre-operative or perioperative can be helpful in assessing the presence of adjacent organs. Generally, FPET-D can be routinely used to detect thymosis, but it is not routine to provide information higher than B403 in other areas of the brain. [40]. In general, occupancy is significantly higher in B3 thymoma and thymus carcinoma than in other thymomas [406]. Definitive staging is usually not possible until the surgeon's assessment of invasiveness and the pathologist's examination of the capsule and resection edges are available. In case of characteristic finding of DT together with clinical suspicion, surgery may be performed without prior biopsy. Otherwise, the diagnosis should be established pre-operatively with interstitial biopsy; this should be avoided if possible to do transpleural.

However, in individual selected cases, patients with preoperative suspected spread to unilateral pleura/pericard in form of drop metastasis (stage 4a according to Masaoka-Koga) may also be recommended surgery. This is provided that the primary tumour, with any inhabitant, can be assessed to be removed radically, combined with a locustostatic blockage, and that the combined pleural /pericardial metastasies cannot be removed with traditional thymus radiation in conjunction with perioperative thymicroscopy. In addition, in such cases, intraoperative hyperthermotherm surgery cannot be performed (CITHO 409). Lymph node dissection has traditionally not been performed in conjunction with cirrhotic tumours.

It should therefore be borne in mind that in several cases there is no overall consensus on recommendations even though most apply similar treatment principles. Treatment recommendations for postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) depend on tumour stage, WHO classification and surgical radicalism. The most important prognostic factor is radicalisation at the time of surgery. If this is not achieved, most consider post-operative radiotherapies to be standard. In complete resection, however, the indication for adjuvant radiation depends on tumor stage and WHO classifications [413]. In radically operated patients with stage 1 tumour disease, on the other hand, the recidivity rate is so low (< 2%) that the prognosis is barely improved by PORT. One study did not see a complete meta-analysis of the thymomas at surgery. However, even with PORT, no overall improvement in survival has been observed over the course of a single day, although the data published in the review of PORT do not show a complete difference, and even more than a meta-evaluation of the outcome of the treatment.[4142]",

Previously, PORT was given with radiation doses from 30 Gy upwards, but the data indicate that higher doses (> 50) should be given for long-term adjuvant irradiation. an uncertainty regarding the benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy, the risk of long-term adverse reactions should be taken into account, especially in view of the generally good prognosis. As proton therapy has become increasingly available, hope has been raised to minimise the risks of late complications. Several studies have demonstrated benefits of proton treatment compared to phototherapy and a Swedish protocol (PROTHYM) exists for radiation therapy of thymomas. Patients with thymoma where radiation treatment is planned should be included in this study. In patients with inoperable disease up to stage 4A, preoperative chemotherapy should be offered and subsequently reevaluated for ev. surgery and postoperative radiation [417].

The frequency and methods of follow up are primarily governed by knowledge of relapse patterns, evidence of failure of previously detected recurrence and treatment leading to a better outcome. At least two-thirds of recurrences occur during the first 2 years after the end of the treatment programme and data are monitored more closely. [437].

Increased knowledge in primary care is also an important factor for early detection. We are also working to reduce the large regional differences in waiting time from diagnosis to treatment. A review of the national differences in lung cancer care is needed to investigate what is the reason for the large disparity we see today. Where you live should not decide what care you get! We participate in national and international congresses and in the work of local and national health care programmes, etc. The Lung Cancer Society also participates in national associations of patient associations and in several international patient association projects, amongst others. We receive financial support in the form of government grants from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency and contributions from the Cancer Fund. The association also carries out projects with the support of pharmaceutical companies. The cooperation takes place entirely on the association's own terms and in accordance with the ethical regulations of the pharmaceuticals industry. We are pleased with the rapid development of new effective medicines against lung cancer and are keen that it should continue and that these medicines should also be available to lung cancer patients in Sweden.
