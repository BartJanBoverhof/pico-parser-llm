      "text": "The evidence of molecular alterations in cancer cells has not only provided a better understanding of the mechanisms that have affected the development of the disease, but also developed therapies that target these molecular abnormalities. The molecular characterization of the tumour has thus become a determining criterion in the choice of therapeutic strategy. It allows to restrict the prescriphon of a number of treatments to the above-mentioned pahents to benefit from and thus reduce the number of inuhles, toxic and costly treatments. Targeted therapies guided by biomarkers in non-small cell bronchial cancer In non-pehte-cell bronchical cancer (NPC), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ITK) constunctuate a major therapeuhque weapon in metasthacs. Since 2009, gefihnibbibhib has had a marketing autorisahon (AMM) for the pahenents whose tumor carries a mutahon achkevatrice of the EGFR. Since then, the gefibhibonhib, lithnokib, luhanchoi, luh. Since then, the osimerhnib, the afahnib, theosimerhnib and the dacomihnib have also been given an MA in ceke indicahon. In addition, the orimerhnib can now be prescribed by adjuvant after complete tumour resechon for the pahents with an achvatory EGFR mutahon from stage IB to IIIA, after adjuvenating chemotherapy when indicated. Other types of predichf biomarkers of the response to targeted therapies have also entered clinical prahk in the CBNPC for the prescriphon of targeted therapies, such as fusions involving the ALK and ROS1 genes. The arrival of second or third generahon treatments, effective against certain mutahons of resistance to targeted therapy, opens new perspechves for the pahents that have become resistant to one of these treatments. In addition, after decades of disappointing results, promekor results obtained with Immune System Control Inhibitors for the treatment of metastahic melanomas have re-established immunotherapy as a major alternahve in cancer treatment. In CBNPC, Immunity System Control Point Inhibitories have obtained AMMs, some of which are condihoned by the level of PD-L1 expression (atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, cemiplimab, durvalumab), thus making it necessary to search for this clinical rouhne biomarker. (atézolizumab, pembrolizumab, cemiplimab, durvalumab), thus making it necessary to search for this biomarker in clinical rouhne. Furthermore, therapies targeting new permeken alterations should widen the cases where the prescriphon of targeted therapies is possible: • KRAS mutahon G12C allows the pre-scriphon of adagrasib in the context of a compassionate access authority (AAC) (reimbursement of sotorasib has been refused); • several treatments exist for the sohents with mutaphons resulting in the jump of MET 14 (crizohnib: AAC; tepohnib: MAMM, reimbursement in France during d Note: MAHs are issued by EMA, but France then decides whether or not to refund medicines. The fact that a medicine has a MAH does not mean that it is available and refunded in France. The High Authority of Health (HAS) gives an opinion on the reimbursement and then the Nahonal Health Insurance Fund (CNAM) decides on the refund. In case of reimbursement, the price is then negotiated with the industrialist. This process can be lengthy. Before the MAH or between the MAM and the decision to refund made by the CNAM, there are in some cases early access disposihfs, issued by the Nahonal Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM): compassionate access (AAFC) or early access (APA) and early access authorizations post-AMM.",

      "text": "The deployment of new generation sequencing (NGS) allowed the analysis of multiple molecular alterations constituting potential therapeutic targets. In the case of solid tumour analysis, a minimum list of 16 genes was published by INCa2 for routine use. DNA NGS (DNAseq) is not always sufficient to analyze all required biomarkers, and complementary techniques are deployed in clinical prahc, such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the study of protein expression such as PD-L1 and ALK, or NGS sequencering on RNA (RNAseq) for searching for fusion transcripts. Furthermore, while the search for these molecular anomalies remains conventionally performed on the tumour tissue attached to formol and included in paraffin, an alternative biological source, commonly called \"liquid biopsy\" is increasingly used. This term refers to the isolation of biological material released by the tumor in the bodily fluids, most often this molecular abnormalities can be more likely to be analysis of the blood, but also the chemically-decided liquid, called \"liviasidien\". This analysis can be repeated in the course of the patient's treatments. Thus, the strategy for performing molecular tests is complicated with: • the need to search for biomarkers of a different nature for the same patient and to use several techniques in parallel; • the possibility of using multiplexed techniques, allowing the search for several molecular anomalies simultaneously; • increasing possibility of accessing experimental treatments based on the presence of new targets. 2 Minimum gene lists to be analysed in the context of a diagnostic use of the NGS (February 2016), available for download on cancer.fr Therefore, the choice of the strategy of the tests to be performed must take into account the following issues: • research all biomarker(s) allowing patients to have access to the treatments they could benefit from, including in clinical trials, so as not to lead to loss of chance; • manage the amount of existing tumour tissue to be able to perform all the tests necessary for the therapeutic decision and/or to predict liquid biopsies; • ensure that all the molecular tests required are carried out in the framework of clinical trials in order not to cause loss of luck; • managing the quantity of the available tumour tissue tests in order to ensure that the correctness of the results are made. The purpose of this document is to recommend the tests to be performed and not the treatments to be administered. Treatments are mentioned to explain the interest of the tests, but the list of therapeutic choices for patients is not exhaustive. Furthermore, the access to molecules evolves very quickly and requires real-time follow-up by the practitioner involved. This document also does not contain recommendations on how to carry out the tests but only the techniques to be used when there are several of them for a single biomarker. Tests must be carried out according to the good practices of anatomopathology and of molecular biology in particular, unless these recommendations of molecular tests are relevant to the clinical tests.",

In the case of a negative result, it must be supplemented by an NGS to identify all mutations from EGFR; • searching for fusions of EGGFR can be done by IHC, FISH or RNAseq. If a NGS panel has not been performed at first intent and in anticipation of second-line treatment, it is essential to complete the rapid test with a multiplexed analysis of the NGS type seeking mutations and fusions. The NGS panels used should be able to search, as a minimum: • mutations in the following genes: o EGFR: search for alterations in exons 18-21 (including insertions of l-exon 20), o KRAS: search of mutations into l-Exon 2 (in particular the G12C mutation), o BRAF: searchfor a BRAF V600 mutation, o HER2/ERRB2: searching for mutations within l-xon 20, o MET: researching alterations leading to a leap from l-Xexon 14; • fusions involving the following gene(s): ALK, ROS1, RET, NRK1/2/3; • MET amplification. The delay in rendering the result of these multiplex tests must not exceed 3 calendar weeks. The research may be carried out in one or two molecular cases, the DNA may be investigated on a parallel or sequential basis. • In the case of progression is made on a path of the biops. These tests must be performed on a progressive lesion sample. In cases where biopsy is not possible, the research can be carried out on liquid biopsies. The search for other molecular alterations emerging by large gene panels or sequencing within the framework of the France Médecine Génomique plan can be discussed in SPC and/or molecular staff, according to the local/national organization. • from the second treatment line: For advanced non-spidermoids/metastatic CBNPCs in the absence of EGFR mutation, it is necessary to look for the overexpression of c-MET by IHC and the amplification of MET if this has not been done before.",
