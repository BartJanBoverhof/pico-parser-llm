      "text": "The deployment of the next generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed the analysis of multiple molecular alterations constituting potential therapeutic targets. In the case of solid tumour analysis, a minimum list of 16 genes has been published by INCa2 for routine use. DNA NGS (DNAseq) is not always sufficient to analyze all required biomarkers, and complementary techniques are deployed in clinical prahc, such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the study of protein expression such as PD-L1 and ALK, or NGS sequencering on RNA (RNAseq) for searching for fusion transcripts. Furthermore, while the search for these molecular anomalies remains classically carried out on the tumour tissue-based techniques (i.e., recombinantly fixed to formol and included in paraffine), an alternative biological source, generically called \"liquid biopsy\" is increasingly used. This term refers to the isolation of biological material released by the tumor in the bodily fluids, whereas the search of these molecular abnormalities usually allows for the biologically-based analysis of the process of biological processes, thus allowing for the process to be more than the process a process of the biological process of a process. This is why the choice of the strategy of the tests to be performed must take into account the following issues: • research all biomarkers enabling patients to have access to the treatments they could benefit from, including in clinical trials, so as not to lead to loss of chance; • manage the amount of tumour tissue existing in order to be able to carry out all the tests necessary for therapeutic decision-making and/or to predict liquid biopsies; • ensure that all the necessary molecular tests are carried out within a time compatible with the start of the treatment of the patients; • monitor the quality of the molecular tests carried out taking into consideration the performance of the techniques used. This document presents the conclusions of the group of experts on the test strategy to be put in place in patients with CBNPC for an optimal care strategy at all stages of the disease (considering the data available on the day of writing of the document). It is necessary to make such tests not to make the tests available to the patients. Unless otherwise stated, these test recommendations apply to patients with CBNPC, apart from the smoking patient's epidermoid carcinomas.",
