A recent sub-analysis of this study also showed that the benefit is greater in COPD patients with FEV1/FVC <0.7 ratio, where mortality reduction was observed by 37% (16).

In Western countries, the frequency of the ADC is clearly increasing (>50%), while CS and microcytoma are significantly reduced (29). In recent years, the precise haematological definition of non-small cell lung cancers (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, NSCLC) has become critical thanks to the development of new therapies related to the histotype (29-32). The diagnosis can be based exclusively on conventional morphological criteria observed in hematoxylin-eosin or by specific colorations (e.g. May-Grunwald-Giemsa) adopted in cytological preparations, but the immunohistochemical investigations (IHC) may be found to be poorly different for the definition of NCI in case of non-specific, or otherwise differentiated, but non-types.",

The lobectomy associated with ilo-mediastinic lymphadenectomy represents the standard surgical approach in lung cancer. The anatomical segmentectomy is acceptable only for patients with non-solid lesions with ground glass (Ground Glass Opacities, GGO) or for very early stages (Tis or T1a). In fact, the lesions that present at the TAC as GGO often configure the presence of an adenocarcinoma in situ or minimally invasive. The determination of the prognostic profile of these tumors has allowed to assume the effectiveness of sublobar surgical treatments with very high rates of cure (143). The lobectomies with reconstructive procedures using bronchoplasty (sleeve lobectomy) or plastic of the pulmonary artery are indicated in selected cases and can effectively avoid the pneumonectomy.",

Among these studies it is certainly worth mentioning that in patients with advanced NSCLC, followed by Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston between 2006 and 2009 (463). The aim of the study was to evaluate the addition, to standard oncology assistance, of an early palliative treatment program for patients with new advanced NSCLC diagnosis.

Common approach to all the LGs remains to formulate the clinical question to which the recommendation will be produced following the P.I.C.O.

An indication of this type can only strengthen our approach to the production of recommendations for clinical practice, since the integration between the two systems has always been the proposal of this methodological group. Precisely for this reason, since 2016, AIOM has decided to abandon the evaluation of the evidence according to SIGN to focus on GRADE and to deal little at a time with all the relevant clinical questions with the latter gradually replacing it to SIGN.
