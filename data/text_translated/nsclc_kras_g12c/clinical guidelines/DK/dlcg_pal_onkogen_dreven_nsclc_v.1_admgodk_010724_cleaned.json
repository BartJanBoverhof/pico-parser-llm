      "text": "The treatment of all patients with pulmonary adenocarcinomas is complex and based on the genomic profiling of patients' tumors and/or free tumor DNA in blood (ctDNA). The understanding of the molecular biological mechanisms is developing rapidly after the introduction of next generation sequence (NGS). The development is directed towards a treatment, tailored to the individual gene errors (variants); the EGFR mutation must be treated quite differently from what protein-change gene error (variant) in EGFR gene causes (e.g. EGFR exon 19 del versus EGFR Exon 20 insertion). Because of this deeper understanding of disease biology and the derived even more targeted treatment, the development of new drugs will increasingly be based on studies with fewer patient populations. Our classic assessment of efficacy on the basis of large randomised phase III studies will be challenged. The main purpose of the guideline is to support an evidence-based high and uniform quality cancer interventions across Denmark. The treatment of onkogen-driven NSCLC is in rapid development and many new medicinal products are approved annually by the FDA (fast-track) and often subsequently by EMA. This development must also be part of which calls for an overall Danish effort and monitoring, in close cooperation with the Medical Council (MR). This guideline is an attempt to gather and update the new knowledge and approvals in FDA, EMA and MRI within the field. Patient group Guideline patients are patients with curable stage III-IV NSclC, where genomic tumour profiling at the time of diagnosis has been found the following variants in the genes: EGFR, KRAS (G12C), BRAF (V600E), MET, ERBB2, ALK, RET, ROS1 and NTRK. Patients with onkoken-driven NACLC have generally a better prognosis than the other patients with NSBLCCLC. Oncoke-driven NSCLC may, however, occur in smokers and therefore all patients with adenocarcinomas or NSclC NOS should be cleared with a broad genomic profile, independent of smoking history. In addition, genomic profiling of tumours from patients with squamous cell carcinoma at young age or patients with planocellular carcinoma combined with sparing or negative smoking history should be considered.

      "text": "The treatment decisions should therefore reflect this development. Therefore, it is recommended that patients in progression during TKI have a new genetic profiling on progressive metastasis and that this profile be discussed on a molecular tumor board (if available) or with colleagues in pathological ward. In general, it should be recommended to treat the individual patient for as long as possible with relevant TKIs, also described in ESMO and NCCN guidelines. The way in which progression appears in patients during the TKI treatment has an impact on the choice of treatment. In case of oligoprogress, a biopsy from a prognostic metastase may be considered, determining the next treatment selection. In the case of asymptomatic systemic progression, consideration may be given to treatment with TKI \"beyond progression\" during closer monitoring of disease activity. In line with the ESMO guidelines, it is recommended that genetic profiling be performed both at the time of diagnosis of incurable NSCLC and at progression during targetated therapy. Following a national consultation among pathologists (DaLuPa) with special responsibility for lung cancer, the following consensus (April 2024) has been reached (April 2024). Diagnostics of inecutable NSclC of the type pulmonary adenocarcinoma or NSCLENOS (not crosswise specified) (all patients) (2) Diagnosis of inkurable planocellular carcinoma and never smokes (<15 package years) or age < 50 years. 3) In progression for on-on-coke primary therapy (no otherwise specified) patients (april 2024). The following variants should be studied, in line with the ESMO guidelines, on both diagnostic biopsy and on progression under specially oncogen-driven treatment (see descriptions of resistance mechanisms under each variant's recommendations): 1. EGFR variants (all in exon 18-21 with description of variant) 2. ALK fusions (all variants with descriptions of fusion partners) 3. ALK variants other 4. ROS1 mergers (all variations with description by fusion partner) 5. BRAF V600E 6. NTRK re-arrangements 7. MET exon 14 skipping mutations 8. MET variants others and amplifications 9. RET mergers ( all variants with description for fusion partners). 10. KRAS G12C 11. ERBB2 mutations and amplications Which material Sufficient and enough material is necessary to ensure the possibility of full genetic profiling. This may be the case of the cancerous agents. This is why a potential solution to these challenges is to test circulating cell free tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma, as a supplement to tissues of tumour tissue is due to the tumour tumour tissue tissue to tissue tissue tissue. On the basis of the tumor tumor tissue tissue, the tissue tissue is exposed to the tumors' tissue tissue and the tissue cell tissue tissue remains intact. On a low proportion of tumor cells in the biopsy may induce a delay in the analysis and therefore focus on ensuring sucient material from the start of the study. Biopsies of tumour tissues Finneel aspirates (e.g. EBUS) or histologic biopsies (GNB/endoscopic) with Sucient material for genetic profiling should be used. OBS: be aware of the need for clot material on cytological material for immunohistochemical analysis for PD-L1 can be performed. Pleura fluid / Blood (ctRNA) 1. Pleural fluid Pleurian fluid Pleuar fluid can be used, but be aware that there is sufficient number of tumour cells for genetic profile testing, also RNA in plasma. The detection of ctDNA in plasma is due to the fact that the cancer disease secretes ct DNA into the bloodstream (shedding tumor), but the amount of secreted tumor DNA may vary from tumor to tumor. According to ESMO guidelines, for patients with advanced oncogen-driven NSCLC, there are validated and sufficiently sensitive ctRNA tests that can be used routinely in clinical practice. ct=1 analyses can be usefully used when repeated analyses are needed or when tissue biopsy is not possible or inappropriate. The interpretation of ctsDNA results should be done in dialogue with pathologist and molecular biologist. Analysis of cthDNA is not fully implemented in DK and is therefore not available as standard in several regions. For this reason, lack of findings that variants examined on ct RNA cannot be used to exclude the presence of a variant. Other examples of limitations on cts DNA analyses: 1) Inability to detect phenotypic changes (example transformation to other cancer). 2) Not all NGS panels can identify fusion and copy number changes. The use of multiplex DNA and RNA based platforms (NGS) is recommended for testing for oncogen-driven NSCLC. In the case of sparing tissue material, where the validity of an NGS analysis will be questionable, immunohistochemical or FISH analysis may be used instead for the detection of ALK or ROS1 fusion, but in the event these are positive, the rebiopulation should be carried out with respect to detection of the fusion partner by NGS. In addition, it is important to note that gene deletions and amplifications cannot be detected with sufficient certainty if the tumour percentage of the available tissue material is low. In line with this consideration, the examination for cMET amplification, immunohistochemical examination, which in case of high and strong positivity of the tumor cells should be confirmed by the FISH study for the cMET. For ctDNA TSO500 or Oncomine Lung cfDNA panel, is applied to the centers analys ctose in DK. According to ESMO regulants, validated panels can be used in the maristable practices [tories]. The remaining patients with activating classical EGFR mutations and performance status 0-3 can be offered 1st line treatment with osimertinib (A) Literature and evidence review Ad. Recommendation 2 EGFR mutated NSCLC is seen in approximately 15% of all patients diagnosed with incurable pulmonary adenocarcinoma, the most frequent (classical) EGFR variants are EGFR exon 19 deletion (45%), and EGFR L858R (40%). Treatment for short duration of treatment is continued for systemic progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. Osimertinib is a 3rd generation irreversible EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that selectively inhibits both above EGFR variants. Osimertinib has been studied in a double-blind phase 3, 1st-line study FLAURA (3.4)[1b]. Patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R were randomised, 1:1, between standard TKI (gefitinib or erlotinib) and osimitinib. It was possible for patients with EGF R T790M in the standard arm to cross over to the osimetinib arm at progression. OS (38.6 months vs 31.8 months), PFS (18.9 months vs 10.2 months vs 10.2 months) and median duration of response (DOR) (17.2 months vs 8.5 months) was significantly better for the osimateinib arm. The median time to response was 6.1 weeks (time of first evaluation) and mean duration of responses (DORS vs 8.5 ms 8.5 months). The seen mer effect for osimertinib was similar in all subgroups (age, PD-L1 status (5)[1b], EGFR variant, CNS metastases). The PFS (15.2 months vs. 9.6 months) was significantly longer during osimertinib for patients with CNS metastases. In the AURA 3 study, randomised Phase III (8)[1b], where patients were treated with 2nd line osimitinib after progression of 1.2 generation EGFR TKI was seen an improved CNS ORR (70% versus 31%), CNS PFS (11.7 months versus 5.6 months) and CNS DOR (8.9 months  vs. 5.7 months) compared to chemotherapy (platin plus pemetrexed). FLAURA 2 study investigated Osimertinib in combination with chemotherapy (9)[1b]. Untreated patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R were randomised 1:1 in an open-label phase 3 study between standard osimatertinib versus osimimitinib plus platinum chemotherapy plus pemtrexed. PFS (16,7 months vs 25,5 months) with DOR (15,3 months vs Stable CNS metastases (PFS: 13.8 months vs 24.9 months) and for patients with EGFR L858R variant (PFs: 13.9 months vs. 24.7 months). The preliminary OS data were presented on ASCO 2024: OS for the combination= NR, for osimitinib monotherapy=38.6 months. Adverse reactions grade ≥ 3 were 64% for the compound vs. 27% for osimertinib. SAE (all) was 38% in the combination arm vs. 19% in the osimetinib monapotherapy arm. The most frequent adverse events were bone marrow effects: 71% (co-arm) vs. 24% (osimertimatinib arm). There was no difference in the degree of pneumonia between the two arms (3-4%). The study did not achieve its primary endpoint (1 year PFS rate). The study describes adverse reactions ≥ degree 3: Diare: 2.8 percent, rash 0% and pneumonitis 6%. The Summary of Product Characteristics for osimertinib describes on the basis of the ADURA, FLAURA and AURA3 studies, an increased incidence of ≥ grade 3 adverse events (13% vs 8%)) for patients ≥ 65 years of age. There was no difference in type of adverse reactions. d. Patients with PS ≥ 2 ESMO guidelines recommend EGFR TKI for patients in this patient group based on ORR, the depth of response and based on manageable adverse reactions (13) [5]. This patient group was not included in the FLAura study. There are no 1st line prospective studies investigating the efficacy of osimateinib in this group of patients. ERLOTINIB/ AFATINIB/ GEFITINIB As an alternative to osimertinib, 1-2. generation TKIs: erlotinib or gefitinib is considered (e.g. by non-handlermatable adverse events shown to osimitinib). In a European randomised phase 3 study (14)[1b] compared to chemotherapy (cisplatin plus docetaxel), first line treatment of patients with classical EGFR mutated NSCLC. The most frequent ≥ grade 3 adverse events to erlotinib were rash (13%), diarrhoea (5%), and elevated liver aminotranferase elevation (2%). Gefitinib showed significantly better ORR (73.7 versus 30.7%) and PFS (10.8 months versus 5.4 months) in a Japanese randomised phase three study (15) [1b], compared with chemotherapy, first line therapy, first-line treatment in patients with classic EGFRmuted NSclC. The most frequent grade 3 adverse reactions to aflatinib are rash (14.6%), diarrhoea (5.4%) and stomatitis/mucositis (5.4%). None of the studies has shown improvement in the OS, probably due to a higher number of patients in the chemotherapy arm being subsequently treated with the studied TKIs (17-19) [1b]. A metaanalysis (20) [1a] compared the efficacy and adverse events profiles of erlotinib, gefitinib and apostinib. The analysis was based on 8 randomised studies and 82 cohort studies. Erlotinib and geptinib showed similar data for PFS and ORR with no significant variation in efficacy between ethnicity, line treatment and incidence of cerebral metastases. Aflatinib had the same effect as gefitimatinib and erlotinib,1. line treatment. Gefitib was described with more liver effects, but totally less ≥ 3 adverse events. 3. Patients with ALK translocation and performance status 0-3 can be offered 1st line treatment with ALk-TKI (brigatinib, alectinib or lorlatinib). The most frequent fusion partner is EML4 (85%). The intracranial response rate was 81% for alectinib versus 50% for crizotinib. Updated analysis (23)[1b] after longer follow-up showed median PFS 34.8 months for alicetinib  vs 10.9 months for crizotinib. Intracranial response - as measured in a small group of patients with measurable brain metastases - was 81%) for alectinib and 50% forcrizotimatinib. The most frequently reported adverse events were nausea (15.8 percent with alectaparin versus 49.7 percent with crizothinib), increased alanine transaminase levels (331.1 percent with alectamine versus 17.1 % with crizottinib) and diarrhoea (13.2 percent with anlectinib vs 46.4% with crisotinib). The most frequent adverse events were diarrhoea (52% with brigatinib and 56% for crizotinib), increased creatinine kinase (46% with brigatinib and 17% with crizothinib), cough (35% with Brigatinib, and 20% with crizotinib), hypertension (32% with Brigathinib and 8% with crizzotinib) and nausea 30% for brigathinib and 58% for crizoteinib). The 3-year PFS rate was 43% for brIGATinib and 19% for crizzotinib. Brigatimatinib showed intracranial activity: median intracranial DOR was 33.2 months for brigatainib and 13.8 months for crizontinib (25) [1b]. The study showed: The median PFS for lorlatinib was NR and median PFs for crizotinib was 9.3 months (26) [1b]. A significant intracranial ORR 82% was observed for lorlateinib versus 23% for crizotinib. 3-year PFS was 64% for lorlatinib and 19% for crizonatinib. In patients without brain metastases, one (1 %) in the Lorlatinib group, and 25 (23 %) of the crizottinib group was intracranial progression. The most frequent adverse events during treatment with lorlateinib were hypercholesterolaemia 82.4% (13.9% grade 3), hypergliceridemia 60.7% (13.2% grade 3) and oedema 51.2% (2.4% grade 3), peripheral neuropathy 43.7 % (2.4% degree 3) and cognitive influence 23.1% (1.7% grade 3) (27)[1b]; treatment with statins is recommended at first signs of elevated cholesterol and/or triglycerate levels. Pravastatin or rosuvastatinvastatin should be the first choice based on their lack of CYP.",

      "text": "For EML4-ALK variant 3, ORR for brigatinib is 91% versus 68% for alectinib (23)[1b]. In addition, in approximately 10 percent of patients with other than EML4 fusion partner (e. g. STRN, PLEKHH2, KANK1), response to alectinib (28-30)[4] has only been reported. Additionally, the patient's preferences should also be taken into consideration under alectimatinib variant 3. Unlike other ALK-TKIs, co-mutation in TP53 has less influence on the effect of lorlatinib (32)[1b] in the patient group with EML-4-ALK version 3 and co-existing TP53 mutation is seen in a mPFS in patients with 2xivating. Patients with PS ≥ 2 patients in PS3 were not included in the Phase 3 studies (ALEX, ALTA-1L and CROWN). Spacious real-world data show that these patients also benefit from ALK-TKI, however, the efficacy is probably less than in patients with PS 0-2 (33)[2b]. For patients with PS ≥ 2 recommend ESMO and NCCN guidelines, ALK TKI. It is assessed that data from EGFR studies that have shown high ORR, manageable adverse reactions and improvement of PS can be extrapolated to other oncogenic drivers (13)[5]. Elderly patients Elderly patients over 65 years of age may be treated, according to the ALK/TKI SPCs, without adjustment of dose. 4. Patients with ROS1 translocation and performance status 0-2(3) may be offered 1. line entrectinib, alternative crizotinib (B) Litterature and evidence review Ad. recommendation 4 In patients with ROS1 trans-analysis patients with NSCLinib to patients with a placeboC is considered. The most frequent AEs grade 3-4 were weight gain (8%) and neutropenia (4%). CNS metastasisation In a retrospective study of patients with ROS1 translocated NSCLC on treatment with crizotinib, 36% had brain metastases at the time of diagnosis (35)[4]. For 47% of patients, CNS was the first and only locating for progression. Entrectinib probably had a better effect in CNS than crizothinib (36)[5]. REPOTRECTINIB Repotrectinib is recommended as possible treatment, especially for patients with cerebral metastasis, in ESMO and NCCN Guidelines. Repotrectinib is not EMA approved by the study. ORR was 72% and median DOR 24.7 months mPFS was 19.3 months and mOS 51.4 months. This led to the approval of crizotinib to ROS1 translocated NSCLC. The most frequent AEs grade 3 were hypophosphataemia (15%), neutropenia (9%), transaminase increase (4%) and vomiting (4%). Elderly patients Elderly patients over 65 years of age may be offered treatment According to the Summary of Product Characteristics for entrectinib and crizothinib, treatment can be given without dose adjustment. Patients with PS ≥ 2 For patients with PS≥ 2 recommend ESMO and NCCN guidelines ROS1. Patients with RIGHT Translocation and PS 0-2 are assessed to be available on the first line of platinum-containing chemotherapy (B). Consider self-resistant adverse reactions and improvement of PS can be extrapoled to other oncogenic drivers (13)[5]. The most frequent RET fusion partners were KIF5B (45% of patients) and CCDC6 (10% of patients), 82% versus chemotherapy +/- immunotherapy, 58%. More than one third of patients achieve complete response intracranial. On the basis of the LIBRETTO-431 study, the regional medical committee may be considered for authorisation of the first line Selpercatinib. Adverse reactions The most frequent adverse events of the Selpercateinib were increased AST/ALT, hypertension, diarrhoea, oedema, dry mouth, increased bilirubin and prolonged QTc interval. Severe and life-threatening pneumonitis may occur. The incidence of grade 3 and higher adverse reactions was more frequent for self-percatimatinib than for chemotherapy (70% vs 57%). IMMUNTERAPY MONOTERAPI Immunotherapy monotherapy should be avoided in this patient group. Since the RET variant is rare, limited data are available. The IMMUMEATARGET study is ALK, ROS1 and RET analysed as an overall group and for this group no efficacy of immunotherapy as monotherapy has been observed (39). Elderly patients treatment with self-Percatinib has shown efficacy independent of age and is generally well tolerated in patients ≥ 65 years. The frequency of reported adverse events is higher for increasing age groups; ≥ 65-74 years (58 years ≥ 75. Patients with active BRAF V600E and performance status 0-2 can be offered first line treatment with chemotherapy +/- immunotherapy or immunotherapy monotherapy according to non-oncogenic NSCLC guidelines (B) Literature and evidence review Ad. recommendation 6 Patients with activating BRAFV600E can be provided 1st line treatment by chemotherapy+/- immunotherapy or immunotherapies according to Non-oncogenous NACLC Guidelines (B).",

      "text": "In a retrospective study, data were available from 20 NSCLC patients who had received different types of chemotherapy and achieved a PFS of 4.0 months and an OS of 9.5 months. Twelve of the 20 patients receiving Pemetrexed-based chemotherapy had an ORR of 33.3 % (43)[2b]. In another retrospective study 3 of 11 patients with NSclC treated with chemotherapy achieved a partial response (44)[2 b]. As these data are not head-to-head comparison, these data should be interpreted with caution and can only give a weak idea of what can be achieved with chemotherapy in NSCLEC patients with METex14. Tepotinib or Capmatinib (due to their intracranial effect) may be considered in the first line of patients with cerebral metastases following the approval of regional drug committees (45-48) [2b] VISION is a phase 2 non-reverse treatment with bone marrow in patients. Crizotinib was also considered in line 1 for patients unfit for chemotherapy (see recommendation 16). IMMUNTERAPI MONOTERAPI NSCLC patients with METEX14 appear to respond less to immunotherapy, but the reported response rates are inconsistent (39). According to NCCN guidelines 2024, immunotherapy is not recommended as a general rule, nor for patients with high PD-L1 levels. 8. Patients with activated KRAS G12C and performance status 0-2 can be offered 1st-line chemotherapy +/-immune therapy according to non-oncogen-driven NSclC guidelines. Immunotherapy monotherapy is an option for this patient group. In the retrospective inventory of patients with oncogen drive G12c variant can be provided 1st line chemotherapy plus/immunotherapy according to Non-onkogen Drive NS CLC guidelines . Immunotarget: 271 patients with KRAS mutations included. ORR was found to be 26% and mPFS was 2.5 months for mOS was 13.5 months for Keynote 042: mPFs 12 months for patients with CRAS mutation. 9. Patients with activated EGFR exon20 ins/ ERBB2 (HER2) /NTRK variants and PS 0-2 can be offered 1st line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy (B) Literature and evidence review Ad. Recommendation 9 EGFR Exon 20 inserts Patients with NSCLC and activating EGFR EXON 20 insertion may be offered on the first line treatment of platinum-dubled chemotherapy as recommended in ESMO (13)[5] and NCCN guidelines 2024 (51)[5]. The specific EGFR exon 20 insertion variants: p.V769_D770 insX. (24.6%), p.D777_N771 insx (25.5%) and p.H773_V774 ins X (22.6%) are typically resistant to the classic EGFR TKIs. Platin-based chemotherapy for this type of variant has an effect, but it is limited: ORR 23-29% and PFS 3.4-6.9 mdr. (57)[3a]. There is a great need for new treatment options for this patient group. Variant EGFR p.A763_Y764insFQEA (4-6% of all EGFR Exon 20 ins variants) for a protein beliggend helix region has a similar structure to the classical EGFR variants and is the only description of EGFRexon20insfQEA (46% of each EGFR EXON 20 INS variant). On the basis of the above, it can be considered to offer first line osimertinib to this variant under close response monitoring. ERBB2(HER2) mutation For description of ERBB 2 variants / HER2 see recommendation 18. No one, in EMA, approved HER-directed TKI, antibodies or ADCs, as first line treatment of ERB2 (HER2) mutated / augmented / or for overexpression of HER2 receptor in NSCLC. Therefore, this patient group is treated, according to recommendation for palliative 1st line treatment in patients with non-oncooked pulmonary adenocarcinoma. According to the ESMO consensus report for HER2 NSclC (60)[5] limited efficacy of chemotherapy +/ immunotherapy to this patient population and therefore patients should be offered inclusion in Danish studies if possible. NTRK fusion Patients with NSCLEC and NTRK fusion can be offered 1. line treatment with platinum-dubled chemotherapy as recommended in ESMO guidelines (13) [5]. NTRK mergers were rare (< 0.1% of NSCLC) and therefore limited data are available. There are no data available on the first line NTRK-oriented treatment with entrectinib and larotractinib. Both treatments are approved by EM NTRk merged NSclC, based on basket trial. Entrectinib was studied in the Phases 1 and 2 basket studies ALKA-372, STARTRK-1 and STARTRk-2 and update data from these studies were published in 2022 (61)[2b]. Out of 121 enrolled patients, 22 NSClC. The ORR was 64% with mDOR of 19.9 months and mPFS of 14.9 months. Entrectinib was effectively intracranial with ORR of 63,6% in patients with CNS metastases at baseline (mixed diagnosis). Larotractinib was investigated in NTRG fusioned NScloC at pooled results from 2 phase 1/2 basket intracranial (20 patients) (62)[22b] at baseline. Patients with active other rare EGFR variants and PS 0-2 can be offered 1st-line treatment with osimertinib (B) Literature and evidence review Ad. recommendation 10 Patients with rare EGFr variants can be provided 1st line osimateinib according to ESMO and NCCN guidelines. Aflatinib is also recommended by the two guidelines, but is not available in DK without prior application by the Medicines Agency. The rare EGFER variants represent 10-14% of all EGFR variations. The most frequent of the rare EGFS variants are EGFR exon 20 insertion (5%) (see separate recommendation 9), EGFR Exon 18 G719X, EGFRexon 20 S768I and EGFR EXON 21 L861Q. Cirka 14% of the Rare EGFR variant is co-administered with another concurrent EGFR version (63) without any impact on the efficacy of osimertinib. There are 3 Phase II studies that investigate the efficacy and efficacy of the EGFR patients. The single-arm phase II studies (64, 65) [2b] investigated the efficacy of osimertinib to 17 and 37 patients with EGFR variants: EGFR exon 18 G719X, EGFR EXON 20 S768I and EGFR Exon 21 L861Q. The studies also showed the following efficacy data: ORR 47-50%, PFS 8.2-10.5 months, DOR 8,7-11,2 months, and OS 13.8 months. The UNICERN study is also a phase II (66) [2 b], single- arm study that examined the efficacy for 40 patients with rare EGFR variant with similar effect, ORR 55%, PFSS 9.4 months and DOR 22.7 months. A fourth patient had cerebral metastases: Intra-cranial ORR: 100%. The effect is described depending on the EGFR version: G7-19: PFS 5,1 months and DOR 22,7 months. The post-hoc analysis showed for patients with rare variants (EGFR exon 18 G719X, EGFR exon 20 S768I and EGFR Exon 21 L861Q) ORR 56%-100%, PFS 10.7 months and OS 19.4 months. Patients with activating classical EGFR mutations and performance status 0-2 and systemic progression (after re- biopsy) can be offered 2nd-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy (A) Litteratur and evidence progression Ad. recommendation 11 All patients with EGFR mutated lung cancer will develop resistance to 1st-line patients on the basis of resistance to the disease. Conversely, selected patients may continue to have clinical efficacy of osimertinib despite photodiagnostic progression (treatment beyond progression). ASYMPTOMATIC PROGRESSION As in ESMO and NCCN guidelines it is recommended to continue osimitinib under close monitoring. OLIGOPROGRESSION One fifth of patients experience progression in individual metastases (≤3) during osimertinib -oligo progression According to ESMO or NCCN guidelines, consideration can be given to providing patients with local treatment for oligoprogregating sites under osimateinib. SYSTEMIC PROGRESION Well half of patients with systemic progression experience systemic progression (>3 progression metastases) (69). The resistance mechanisms under osimetinib are many. It is recommended that selected patients (relevant residual life, AT and performance status) with systemic progress experience of a re-map (grediating metastasis) (66). In particular, patients with co-mutations in TP53 and RB1 are at increased risk of this transformation (67)[3a]. The treatment will in this case be carboplatin and etoposide. For histologic transformation to squamous cellular carcinoma, the patient is treated according to usual first line guidelines for this patient group.",

By far the majority of patients with systemic progression should be provided platinum-based chemotherapy. If re-biopsy contains targetable resistance mechanisms, consideration may be given to treating the resistance mechanisms as monotherapy or under continued osimertinib (combination TKI). On the basis of the limited evidence (see below) for efficacy, this treatment cannot be recommended outside clinical trials. The resistance mechanisms under osimitinib are summarised in 3 review articles from 2023 (67-69) and also examined in the AURA 3 study (70)[1b]. The most frequent targetible variants associated with resistance development under osimatetinib are off-target variants, i.e. genetic changes for proteins outside the EGFR signal pathway. In this recommendation, only variants are described in clinical studies. MET amplification as resistance mechanism has been best studied. See also under recommendation 18 (HER2/ERBB2). MET amplification for proteins beyond the EGF signal path. (14 patients with MET amplification): ORR 67% vs 43%, PFS 16.6 months versus 4.2 months and OS 37.3 months vs. 13.1 months The most frequently reported grade 3 or above adverse events were: Diare (8.3%) and amylase/liposis elevation (33.3%). TATTON study (phase 1b study) (72) [3b] studied the effect of the combination osimertinib plus MET inhibitor savolitinib in the same patient population (B1: patients in progression of 3rd generation TKI) and showed ORR of 33%, PFSS of 5.5 months and DOR 9.5 months. Over half of patients experienced grade ≥ 3 adverse events. The most frequent adverse reactions (all degrees) were nausea (52%) and peripheral oedema (36%). Savolitimatinib is not EMA approved. MD Andersson Cancer Center published, in 2023, an overall case report for patients receiving MET directed treatment (crizotinib, capmatinib, savolitinib or tempoinib) were reported in patients with placebo. In this study, acceptable toxicity was retrospectively reported, however, an increased awareness of pneumonitis was reported especially in patients who have previously received immunotherapy. Real-world data of Danish patients (case series) show that the combination of EGFR-TKI with Crizotinib can result in PFS between 3-19 months depending on other molecular co-alterations (74) [4]. The MARIPOSA-2 study (75) [1b] is a phase III, 3-arm study examining the efficacy of amivantamab (bispecific antibody directed against both EGFR and MET) plus lazertinib (EGFR inhibitor) plus platinum chemotherapy.",

Several adverse reactions were seen in the amifantamab arms compared to chemotherapy: SAE (all) 32-52% vs 20%. Adverse reactions ≥ 3: 72-92% vs 48%. The most frequent adverse events were bone marrow effects. An increased risk of VTE was observed for the amivantamb arms 10%-22% vs 5%. Treatment ceased in 10-22% vs 4% of patients. Combination therapy amiquantamab/chemotherapy is not approved. Amivantanamab monotherapy has not been approved by the EMA, for classical EGFR variants or MET variants (limited evidence) and therefore cannot be recommended as second line treatment for the classic EGFR flavors outside controlled trials. c. The study showed no improvement in PFS or OS by combination. Untreated patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R were randomised 1:1 in an open-label phase 3 study between standard osimertinib versus osimitinib plus platinum chemotherapy plus pemetrexed. Osimertinib in combination with chemotherapy 1st line is significantly better for PFS (25.5 months versus 16.7 months) and DOR (25.5 months vs 15.3 months).

An ESMO expert concensus report from 2022 (2) [5] recommends the combination osimertinib plus chemotherapy for patients with extra-cranial progression below osimertinib and concomitant stable asymptomatic cerebral metastases. The combination Osimertinib plus Chemotherapy is not EMA approved. At the DoLG meeting on 11/6 2024, the addition of chemotherapy to osimateinib in association with progression during osimitinib was discussed.

      "text": "immunotherapy in combination with EGFR TKI or sequentially (EGFR TKI after immunotherapy) results in serious adverse reactions, especially interstitial lung disease and liver involvement. Therefore, immunotherapy is not recommended in combination or as monotherapy to EGFR mutated NSCLC as the next line treatment after osimertinib. Immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy in combination, nor as the second line therapy for EGFR Muted NSclC, is available. Immune therapy combined with Chemotherapy is available with chemotherapy in 4 phase III studies investigating the efficacy of chemotherapy combined with PD-L1 inhibitor, 2nd line therapy after progression under EGFR TO: IMpower 150, Orient-31, CheckMate 722 and Keynote-789. No studies have shown a significantly improved ORR, PFS or OS by versus immunotherapy with versus versus placebo. In a subgroup analysis for 124 patients (78 patients, a history of EGFRTKI) with EGFR variants, no difference was found between athezolizumab plus platinum-dublet (AP) versus bevazizumab plus Platinum-dblet (BP). The study did not have power for these subgroup analyses. The combination ABP is recommended for chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy, but not for NCCN guidelines. Orient-31 (78) [1b] is a Chinese phase III, 3-armed study examining the efficacy of VEGF inhibitor plus PD-1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy for chemotherapy alone, but is not recommended by NCCN guideline. The study showed no significant difference in ORR (31% versus 27%), PFS (5.6 months versus 5.4 months) or OS (19.4 months  vs 15.9 months). Keynote-798 (LBA ASCO 2023) [1b] is a phase III, 2-arm study that examined the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with platinum-dubled chemotherapy against platinum-duplicated chemotherapy alone. The study's results were presented on ASCO 2023 for 492 patients. The trial found no significant differences in ORRS, PFS or OSS. The absence of efficacy was independent of PD-L1 status. Immunotherapy combined with EGFR TKI combination EGFR TDI plus immunotherapy has been studied in a series of Phase I/II studies (80-85) [3b]. All studies reported significant adverse events, especially interstitial lung disease/pneumoniatis, hepatic and gastrointestinal failure to therapy. Therefore, it is not recommended to combine immunotherapy with TKIs. Immunotherapy monotherapy for patients with EGFR TKI resistance is generally not recommended due to lack of evidence of efficacy. A Phase II study (86) [2b], studied the efficacy of pembrolizumab to TKI naïve patients with advanced EGFR mutated NSCLC, PD-L1 ≥ 1% (≥ 50 percent in 74% of patients). The study stopped early due to non-response. A randomised phase II study (87) [2b ] examined the effect of nivolumab against platinum-dubled chemotherapy in patients resistant to EGFR TDI. Hundred-two patients were included and the study showed significant improvement of PFS in favor of the chemotherapy arm (PFS 1.7 months (nivo) versus 5.6 months (chemo) independent of PD- L1 status. There was no difference in OS. IMMONOTARGET (39) [2a] study is a retrospective balance of immunotherapy monotherotherapy for patient with patients with locoprabongrabon. In patients with EGFR mutation, 3.5% PD-L1 ≥ 50% were associated with PD- L1 status: PD-l1 ≥ 1%: 2.8 months versus PD-P1< 1%: 1.7 months. Patients with ALK translocation and performance status 0-2(3) and systemic progression (after re-biopsy) may be offered 2rd to 3rd line treatment with lorlatinib or chemotherapy (A/B) Literature and evidence review Ad. Recommendation 12 All patients will in the long term develop resistance to ALK TKI (21) [1a]. The resistance mechanisms are classified according to whether they are due to a change in the ALK gene itself (on-target) or whether they result from a change of genes associated with the signal pathways independent of ALK (off-target), oravous transformation (88)[2b]. By progression of 3rd generation ALK-TKI at the same time, the same reservations should be taken as with progression under EGFR-TOK, see also for market abuse. SYSTEMIC PROGRESSION On-target resistance mechanisms On- target resistance mechanisms arise as both single mutations and as multiple mutations developed simultaneously (compound mutations) in the ALK gene. These acquired mutations are distinct for each ALK-TKI, also within the same generation of ALK‐TKI. Therefore, in selected cases, it can make sense of switching between the same-generation ALK/TKI in relation to resistance development (e.g. between brigatinib and alectinib (2nd generation TKI). However, it is essential to make a new genetic profiling of progressive metastases (alternative ctDNA) to identify resistance variants (21, 91)[1a, 2b]. Lorlatinib was developed to overcome the most frequent ALK resistance variants occurring during 1-2 generation ALKK-TI. On-target resistance mechanisms developed under lorlatinib are often characterised by the presence of multiple mutations (compundum variants) in ALK12. Therefore, patients should be offered inclusion in clinical trials (if available) or platinum-dubled chemotherapy (21)[2a]. at progression below lorlatinib. Off-target resistance mechanisms Good half of patients who develop resistance to 2nd generation ALK-TKI have no novel ALK variants in progression biopsy. Multiple off-target Resistance mechanisms that activate ALK independent signal pathways under ALK -TKI are described. Cases of response are available by adding crizotinib to continued lorlatinib at acquired MET amplification (21, 89)[1a, 2b]. Several studies investigating the effect of combined TKI are on the way. TKI patients may not be recommended outside clinical trials before further evidence is obtained. Histologic transformation Histological transformation Histhological transformation into small cell lung cancer and squamous carcinoma has been reported in both combination TKI. IMMUNTERAPI MONOTERAPI As for patients with EGFR mutations, there is no safe data to support the use of immunotherapy in patients with ALK fusion (92)[2b]. In a retrospective study of 42 incurable patients with NSCLC and ALK translocation who received immunotherapy without prior ALK-TKI, a very short PFS (2.3 months) was shown. In patients who received immune therapy without prior AlK-TI, it was 3.9 months, and in patients who were receiving immunotherapy after an ALK‐TKI it was 1.5 months (93)[2 b]. For most patients in the study there was no effect of immunotherapy monotherapy. REPOTRECTINIB Repotrectinib is a ROS1 directed treatment that is not yet EMA approved. In the phase 2 part of the TRIDENT-1 study, for patients with ROS1, the ORR was not previously treated with ROs1 TKI, 79% and mPFS was 35.7 months (94)[2b]. For patients treated with ROSE TKI previously, ORR 38% and mMFS was 9.0 months Intra-cranial ORR, for the previously treated patients, was 38%. Twenty-nine percent of patients experienced grade ≥ 3 AEs, the most frequent were anaemia (4%) and elevated creatine kinase (4%). The conclusion of the study was that repotrectedinib had an effect on ROS 1 translocated NSCLC independent of prior treatment with RO SOS1 TKI and independent of cerebral metastasisation. 14.

Here, an ORR of 64% and a median DOR of 17.5 months was found in an interim analysis of Phase 3 study LIBRETTO-431, as assessed against platinum- based chemotherapy +/- pembrolizumab in the 1st line in patients with advanced RET fusion activated NSCLC (38)[1b]. The study shows PFS: 24.8 months versus 11.2 months for Selpercatnib versus platinum-borne chemotherapy+/pembolizumab. ORR: 84% (selpercatimatinib) versus 65% (chemotherapy). The intracranial ORR was 82% (sel Percatinib) vs 58% (chemotherapy+/immunotherapy). More than one third of patients achieve complete response, intracranial. The most frequent RETe fusion partners were KIF5B (45% of patients) compared to filgravefafabrifabris alone. The frequency of grade 2+ adverse events was considered provisionally equivalent to selfpercatinib in MR.

Immunotherapy in monotherapy is not recommended as first line, as there is no clinical evidence nor in patients with high PD-L1 (39, 98, 99)[1a,2b]. According to the NCCN Guidelines Version 1,2024, Capmatinib, Crizotinib, or Tepotinib are offered as first line or later (4)[1b]. Crizoninib (FDA breakthrough designation 2018), Capmataparin (Fda 2020 and EMA 2022) and Tepotinib ( FDA 2021 and ema 2022) are not treated by MR and permission can be applied for in the regional medical committee/ department management. Among MET exon14-positive patients treated with Capmatimatinib in GEOMETRY, Phase 2 the study was ORR 41 % for 69 pre-treated patients and 68 % for 28 treatment-naïve patients; DOR was 9.7 months and 12.6 months respectively, Intracranial ORR was 54%, based on 13 patients with cerebral metastases. DOR were 9.7 month and 11.1 months, and PFS was 5.4 months, respectively, for treated patients and treatment naïve subjects (100)[1b ]. Crizotinib in the PROFIL 1001 study showed that 18 NSCLC patients with METEX14 achieved ORR 32%, PFS 7.3 months and OS 20.5 months (102)[2b]. Adverse reactions The VISION study (Tepotinib) reported adverse reactions, grade 3 or above, in 34.8 percent of patients, peripheric oedema was the most common (67.1 %). In the GEOMETRY study (Capmatinib) reported adverse reactions grade 3 and above, 75% of patients with peripheral oedema were the most frequent (54% for previously treated patients and 75% for treatment-naïve patients). (103) MET amplification In patients with met amplification (CNV >10), MET-TKI (103, 104) can be considered. The phase 2 mutated advanced NSCLC, previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy, was studied in the CodeBreaK 100 study (105) [2b].

Patients with activating EGFR exon20 ins/ERBB2 (HER2) / NTRK variant and performance status 0-1 may be considered offered 2nd line treatment according to EMA approved treatment of matched variant (amivantamab / trastuzumab-deruxtecan / entrectinib or larotractinib after approval by Regional Medical Council (A/B/B) Literature and evidence review Ad. Recommendation 18 EGFRexon20 insertion EGFR Exon 20 insertion changes the kinase domain and limits the binding of the usual EGFR TKI (55.56). Overall, EGFR EXon 20 ins is 4-12 % of all EGFR variants. EGFR excellent 20 insertion alters the creatinine domain and reduces the bindings of the habitual EGFR TOR. The group of patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion variants has a lower prognosis than patients with the classic EGFR variants. a. EGFR Exon 20 p.A763_Y764insX Varianten EGFRexon 20 pp.A763_Y764insx (4-6% of all EGFR EXON 20 ins variants) located in the helix region have a similar function to the classic fondR variants and case reports have shown the effect of EGFR TKIer, also osimertinib (58.59) [4]. Against this background, the second line osimateinib for this variant can be considered during close response monitoring if osimertinib is not used in the first line. b. Other EGFR exit 20 insertions variants For patients with other EGFR examon 20 inns variants one can consider application for single-patient permission in the regional medicine committee for amiquantamab after progression on plan-dubled chemotherapy. Amifantamab is approved in EMA and recommended as second line treatment after platin-dive antivirabilities in both the reserve. The study showed 40%, PFS 8.3 months and DOR 11.1 months. The most common grade ≥ 3 adverse events (35%) was hypokalaemia / diarrhoea / neutropenia / pulmonary embolism. The PAPILLOON study is a randomised phase III study, 1st line treatment that examines the efficacy of the combination of amivanamab plus platinum-dubled chemotherapy for chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced EGFR exon 20 induction mutated NSCLCopeni. Crossing to amiquantamab monotherapy by progression was shown to be significantly improved (see section 4.4). The most frequent ≥ degree 3 adverse events were neutropenia (33%) and rash 11%. High dose osimertinib (exon 20 variants p.(A763-L777)) is a phase II study that examines the effect of high dose osimitinib (160 mg) 2- 3rd line to 25 patients with EGFR exon 20 ins (exone 20 variants pp. ((A763-L77/7)). The study demonstrated limited efficacy: ORR 28%, mPFS 6.8 months and mOS 15.2 months. Adverse reactions were compared to usual dose osumertinib. ERBB2(HER2) mutation For patients with mutations in the ERBB 2 gene, application for single-patent treatment after the platinum-duble chemotherapy in both trasuzumab-deruxtecan (T-Dxd) after progression on plan-double chemotherapy can be considered. The ERBB2 variant consists of 1) ERBB 2 mutations (1-3%), 2) ERBB2, amplification (2-22%) or 3) HER2 receptor overexpression (8-23%). These three groups of variants rarely occur together and HER2 overexpress is not associated with the ERBB2. Therefore, there is much evidence that separate molecular biological mechanisms exist behind superior 3 groups of variations and are therefore likely to have to be treated differently (60). ERBB2-mutations (1%) and ERBB2) amplifications (2%) are well known mechanisms of resistance during treatment with EGFR TKI in patients with EGFS mutated NSCLC. On the basis of sparsome evidence, this recommendation will only undergo treatment options for patients with ERBB1 mutation and briefly affect the treatment of patients with Erb2 augmentation. ErBB2 mutation Varians are most frequently developing in the intracellular part of the patient population. It is therefore important that the development of new phase II treatments is focused on the blood brain barrier and that patients are screened / monitored for development of cerebral metastases. HER2 directed antibodies Two newer phase II studies have examined the efficacy of HER2 double antibody blockade (traszumab plus perzumab) (111, 112) [2b] for patients with HER2 mutated NSCLC. One study examined the effect of HER2, double blockade in patients with ERBB2 mutation or amplification and no additional treatment options. 28 patients were included and the study showed responses (defined as PR plus SD>16 weeks) of 11%. 45 patients and the trial showed ORR 29%, DOR 11 months and PFS 6,8 months than well known for docetaxel monotherapy (OR 7-10%) and PFSS 2,3 months of evidence (less evidence ≥ 3 years) were included. The antibody is bound to the protein internalised antibody and the associated chemotherapy is released inside the cell. In this way, chemotherapy targets the cells expressing the protein in which the antibody used is directed. Traszumab-deruxtecan (T-Dxd) T-DXd for patients with HER2 mutated NSCLC has been studied in Destiny-Lung 01 and 02, Phase II, studies. In the Destiny- Lung 01 study (113) [2b], 91 patients with ERBB2 muted NSclC were included without further treatment (heavy treated). The study showed: ORR 55%, DOR 9.3 months, PFS 8.2 months and OS 17;8 months. The adverse reactions ≥ 3 were seen in 46% of patients. Two patients died from interstitial lung disease. Destininy-Lungs 02 studies [2b ] examined the efficacy and adverse reactions under two doses of TRR-2. The number of patients who developed ≥ 3 degree adverse events was 38.6%. Interstitial lung disease was seen in 12.9% of patients (≥ 3, An effect was also seen, however, less, in patients with HER2 overexpression; ORR 24.5% and PFS 5.4 months Traszumab emtansine (T-DM1) There was also limited evidence of T-DM1 in subjects with NSCLC. A phase II basket study (114)[2b] studied T-DM1 in previously treated patients with ERBB2 mutated and/or amplified NSclC. 49 patients were included. ORR was 50% and 55% for ERBB2, mutated, and augmented NS. PFS was 5 months respectively. Six patients had previously received EGFR TKI based on EGFR mutation plus ERBB2. The ZENITH20 studies (116-118)[2b] investigated the efficacy of poziotinib in previously treated and non-pre-treated patients with ERBB2 exon 20 induction NSCLC. The studies showed ORR 27% - 39%, DOR 5.5 months and PFS 5.5 months respectively. Exon 20 insertion variant: G778_P780dupGSP appeared to have a better effect in the first line study (ORR 71%) (116)[1b]. NTRK fusion Patients with NTRK fusion may be offered entrectinib or larotractinib in the second line after progression of platinum-containing chemotherapy after approval in the regional drug council. Since NTRCHK fusions are rare are entrectimatinib and larotinib studied in basket trials including few patients with NSclC. Entrectinib Entrecinib is studied in Phase 1 and 2 studies in Phase 2 years. Of these, 59.1% had brain metastases at baseline. ORR was 64% with DOR of 19.9 months and PFS of 14.9 months. The most frequent adverse reactions were taste changes (35.2%), diarrhoea (31.1%), fatigue (27,5%) and weight gain Larotrectinib Larotractinib was studied in NTRK-fused NSCLC by pooled results from 2 phase 1/2 basket trials (20 patients) (62)[2a]. ORR was 73%, DOR was 33.9 months, PFS 35.4 months and OS 40.7 months 10/20 patients had cerebral metastasis at baseline, and in these patients the intracranial ORR 63%. Larotractinib was generally well tolerated and most adverse events were Grade 1-2. In addition, treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy +/- immunotherapy (D) Literature and evidence review Ad. recommendation 19 There are no studies on the management of progression during osimertinib in patients with the other rare variants. In general, the effect of osimitinib in rare EGFR variants is limited in relation to the treatment of the classical EGFR variant. Therefore, it should be considered to change therapy at progression, regardless of the type of progression, to platinum-dubled chemotherapy or platinum-duplicated chemotherapy plus immunotherapy according to ESMO and NCCN guidelines. Monotherapy immunotherapy is not recommended as a rule, see under Recommendation 11. Patient values and preferences No significant variation in patients' preferences is expected as the recommended medicinal products have a better effect and less adverse effects than chemotherapy. Rationale recommendations: \"should be used when the recommendation reflects MR treatment guidance.\" A few recommendations deal with MRI non-approved medications.",

Literary review All references published by the search strings have been reviewed by the authors and sorted on the abstract pre-defined patient group and the level of evidence. The ESMO guideline reference lists were also reviewed to ensure that this guideline, which contained the ESMO guidelines, has not been the subject of major disagreements within the group. The Guideline describes the existing consensus on treatment choices for the onkogen drive NSCLC in Denmark. The guideline group has discussed the guideline at a 2-day international and efte at several virtual meetings. The approval guideline has been reviewed by the Chief Medical Officer Marianne Knap, the Cancer Department, AUH Professional approval: The guideline is technically approved by the DOLG Guideline Committee. Administrative approval: 1 July 2024. The cooperation includes experimental protocols, teaching, travel and participation in meetings of experts in different contexts and with various pharmaceutical companies. It is the President's view and assessment that the above cooperation relations do not affect the directional work. Plan for updating the guideline will be updated once a year. The update will take place at the beginning of 2025 in cooperation between the above members of the group. Version of the guideline template is prepared in version 9.3 of the template.",

Parts of the guideline recommend treatments that have not yet been assessed in MRI.

Doctors need to be informed about the use of the standard form of medicine. Through the 7th principle, doctors have the option of offering non-MR-approved treatment which the doctor considers to be the best for the individual patient. The use of expensive hospital medicine must often be approved by the medical committee of the region to obtain reimbursement of the cost. The department managers have often set a maximum amount as a limit for when the costs are paid by the department and the regional medicine committee are therefore not to be claimed for reimbursement. The regions have each formulated a guide for the exercise of the 7rd principle (available on the regional website: Ask clinical pharmacological section if any. Stepvis's overall procedure for these applications is completed). 4. In the application, emphasis must be placed on why this particular patient should be offered the treatment (effect data / no additional treatment/smaller side effect) / CNS metastases with better chance of efficacy / comorbities which are needed to improve the quality of the medicine. The medical committees of the regions typically meet once a week (may vary between regions) 6.

The programs are often open during the period from one study have shown promising results until they are marketed in each country (often in connection with approval of EMA). If the patient is included, the company often covers the cost of the patient's medications until it is marketed. Stepwise superior procedure for these applications 1. Contact to the pharmaceutical firm: The pre-approval access programs (PAAs) are described on the websites of the pharmaceutical firms. Here, the application process is also described and links to relevant contact persons. 2. Overall description of the patients (after acceptance from patient) according to the study's inclusion criteria are sent to the company's contact person. 3. The company approves the drug agency's website. At the same time, an application is sent to the Danish Medicines Agency (LMS) for the dispensation of the medicinal product to the patient via the form on the LMS website (LMs response time is very short, within 1-2 days). It is a very affordable task. 7. If the application is approved by the pharmaceutical company, a contract must be signed with the pharmaceutical firm and your department management. The contract should be discussed with the region's lawyers. The region often has a fixed-track for these contracts.) 8. Contact the hospital's pharmacy which must be responsible for the reception and handling of the medicine 9. Complete a treatment form in consultation with pharmaceutical company and pharmacy 10. The regions have often drawn up a form of written consent to be signed by the patient and the treating doctor. 11.
