      "text": "The treatment of this patient group therefore requires an extremely heterogeneous and biologically unstable cancer with many different treatment options. The group of patients constitutes approximately 60 percent of all patients with pulmonary adenocarcinomas. The treatment options are complex and based on the genomic profiling of patients' tumors and/or free tumor DNA in blood (ctDNA). The understanding of the molecular biology mechanisms is developing rapidly after the introduction of next generation sequence (NGS). The development is directed towards a treatment tailored to the individual gene errors (variants); the EGFR mutation must be treated quite differently from the protein-change gene error (variant) in EGFR gene (e.g. EGFR exon 19 del versus EGFR exon 20 insertion). Because of this deeper understanding of the biology of the disease and the derived even more targeted treatment, the development of new drugs will increasingly be based on studies with fewer patient populations. Our classic assessment of the effect on the basis of large randomised phase III studies will be challenged.",

      "text": "Introduction Oncogen-driven NSCLC must be considered as a disease in constant molecular development in the individual patient. The treatment decisions should therefore reflect this development. Therefore, it is recommended that patients in progression during TKI have a new genetic profiling on progressive metastasis and that this profile should be discussed on a molecular tumor board (if available) or with colleagues in pathological ward. Generally, it is recommended to treat the individual patient for as long as possible with relevant TKIs, also described in ESMO and NCCN guidelines. The way the progression appears in patients during TKI treatment has an impact on the choice of treatment. In the case of oligoprogress, a localisation of the metastatic sites under continued TKI may be considered. In the case of asymptomatic systemic progression, consideration may be given to treatment with TKI \"beyond progression\" during closer monitoring of disease activity. In case of symptomatic systemic progression, a biopsy from a prognosing metastasis may be considered decisive for the next treatment selection.",

Furthermore, in approximately 10 percent of patients with other than EML4 fusion partner (e.g. STRN, PLEKH2, KANK1), response to alectinib (28-30)[4] has only been reported. In addition, the patient's preferences should also be taken into account under alectinib variant 3. Unlike other ALK-TKIs, co-mutation in TP53 has less influence on the effect of lorlatinib (32)[1b].

In a retrospective study, data were available from 20 NSCLC patients who had received different types of chemotherapy and achieved a PFS of 4.0 months and an OS of 9.5 months. Twelve of the 20 patients who received Pemetrexed-based chemotherapy had an ORR of 33.3 % (43)[2b]. In another retrospective study, 3 of 11 patients with NSCLC treated with chemotherapy achieved a partial response (44)[2b]. As these data are not head-to-head comparisons, they should be interpreted with caution and can only give a weak idea of what can be achieved with chemotherapy in NSCLC patients with METex14. Tepotinib or Capmatinib (due to their intracranial effect) can be considered in the first line of patients with cerebral metastasis after the approval of regional drug committees (45-48) [2b] VISION is a phase 2 non-treatment patients, including metaranised study 56.",
