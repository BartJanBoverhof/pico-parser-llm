      "text": "This is also the case for patients with severe liver disease, which is an extremely heterogenic and biologically unstable cancer disease with many different treatment options. The group of patients constitutes approximately 60 percent of all patients with pulmonary adenocarcinomas. The treatment options are complex and based on the genomic profiling of patients' tumors and/or free tumor DNA in blood (ctDNA). The understanding of the molecular biology mechanisms is in rapid development following the introduction of next generation sequence (NGS). The development is towards a treatment, tailored to the individual gene bugs (variants); the EGFR mutation must be treated quite differently from what protein-change gene error (variant) in EGFR gene results (e.g. EGFR exon 19 del versus EGFR Exon 20 induction). Because of this deeper understanding of disease biology and the derived even more targeted treatment, the development of new medicinal products will increasingly be based on studies with fewer patient populations. Our classic assessment of efficacy on the basis of large randomised phase III studies will be developed. Oncoke-driven NSCLC may, however, occur in smokers and therefore all patients with adenocarcinomas or NSclC NOS should be cleared with a broad genomic profile, independent of smoking history. In addition, genomic profiling of tumours from patients with squamous cell carcinoma at young age or patients with planocellular carcinoma combined with sparing or negative smoking history should be considered.

      "text": "The treatment decision should therefore reflect this development. Therefore, it is recommended that patients in progression under TKI have a new genetic profiling on progressive metastasis and that this profile is preferably discussed on a molecular tumor board (if available) or with colleagues in pathological ward. Generally, it's recommended to treat the individual patient for as long as possible with relevant TKIs, also described in ESMO and NCCN guidelines. The way the progression appears in patients during TKI treatment is relevant to the selection of treatment. In case of symptomatic systemic progression, a biopsy from a prognostic metastasis may be considered for the next treatment choice. In the case of asymptomatic systemic progression one can be considered to treat with TKI \"beyond progression\" during closer monitoring of disease activity. For example, if you are looking for a hard case, you will need a hard one, but you will also need a good one. If you have a hard-case case, then you will have a good case. At the same time you will be able to get a good risk for the case, and you will get a better case. If the case is a good idea, you can get a higher risk for your case, if the case has to be tested. If there is a risk for you, you should have a better risk for yourself. If this is the case you will find that you will not be able, you may need a better chance of getting a better job. If your case is not a good solution, you might need to get an alternative. For example, if there is no evidence of the risk or risk of injury, the risk and risk of loss should be considered. If the risk of damage or damage to the liver is not established, then the risk/ risk of death should be taken into account. If a risk or damage is detected, then it should be determined that the risk should be assessed. If there is a risk of non-compliance with the benefit or benefit of the benefit/ benefit, then a risk/ benefit/ risk analysis should be carried out. If an injury or risk assessment is made, then an analysis should also be made of the potential of the injury or damage caused by the risk to the patient. If it is possible to determine whether the risk is due to the risk (i.e. if the risk factor is not observed) or the risk for the risk. The rest of the time (slightly observed) of the stock (swelling) of placebo versus placebo , is usually represented by EGFR exon 20 induction variants. The rare EGFR variants have variable efficacy of EGFR corrected treatment (2), see recommendation 9-10 and recommendation OSIMERTINIB a. Patients with activated classical EGFR variant (EGFR exon 19 deletion and EGFR L858R) are offered first line treatment with osimertinib. The treatment continues to systemic progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. Osimertinib is a 3rd generation irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that selectively inhibits both of the above EGFR variations. Osimmitinib has been studied in a double-blind phase 3, first line study FLAURA (3.)[1b] Patients with EGFR Exon 19 division or L858,R were randomised, 1:1, between standard TKI (gefitinib or erlotinib) and osimatetinib. The interim OS data were presented on ASCO 2024: OS for the combination= NR, for osimateinib monotherapy=38.6 months) and for patients with EGFR L858R were significantly better (PFS: 13.9 months vs. The study describes adverse reactions ≥ grade 3 (3% vs 8%) for patients ≥ 65 years of age. This patient group was not included in the FLAURA study. There are no 1st-line prospective studies to examine the efficacy of osimertinib in this patient group. ERLOTIN/ AFATINIB/ GEFITS is not recommended for patients in this group of patients based on ORR, depth of response and based on manageable adverse reactions (13) [5]. The study has not shown any significant improvement in the OS, however, due to a larger number of patients in the chemotherapy arm subsequently developing with the studied TKIs (17-19) [1b]. A metaanalysis (20) [1a] compared the efficacy and adverse events profiles of erlotinib, gefitinib and aflatinib. The analysis was based on 8 randomised studies and 82 cohort studies. Erlotinib and eractinib showed similar data for PFS and ORR with no significant variation in efficacy between ethnicity, line treatment and incidence of cerebral metastases. Apostinib had the same effect as gefitamine and erlotafia,1 line treatment. Gefitib was described with more liver impact but totally less ≥ 3 adverse reactions. 3. Patients with ALK translocation and performance status 0.3 can be seen in 4-6% of all patients with Trudexa. The most common adverse reactions were diarrhoea (52% with brigatinib and 56% for crizotinib), elevated creatinine (0.7% with alectinib and 3.3% with crizo tinib).",

Unlike other ALK-TKI patients, co-mutation in TP53 has less influence on the effect of lorlatinib (32) [2b] is particularly associated with significantly longer PFS in patients with eML4-ALS variant 3. In contrast to other ALQ-TKIs, a mPFS patient has a treatment with tweaking. For patients with cerebral metastases, Entrectinib is likely to have a better effect in CNS than crizotinib (36)[4]. REPOTRECTINIB Repotrecinib is recommended as possible treatment, especially for patients with cerebral metastasies, in ESMO and NCCN guidelines. Repotrectinib is not approved. See also under the recommendation 13. CRIZOTINIB In an updated analysis of Phase 1 study PROFILE 1001 (37)[2b], the efficacy of crizotinib to ROS1 translocated NSCLC patients was investigated. ORR was 72% and median DOR 24.7 mdr. MPFS was 19.3 mdR and mOS 51.4 mDr. The most common risk-free treatment for patients with risk-based RRS and risk-mitigation regimens are: the most common treatment for SELRO and NCCN guidelines. Based on the LIBRETTO-431 study, consideration may be given to applying the regional drug committee for permission to 1st line self-percatinib. Adverse reactions The most frequent adverse events with SELPERcatinib were elevated AST/ALT, hypertension, diarrhoea, oedema, dry mouth, elevated bilirubin and prolonged QTc interval. Severe and life-threatening pneumonitis may occur. Since the RET variant is rare, data are available.

Twelve of the 20 patients who received Pemetrexed-based chemotherapy had an ORR of 33.3 % (43)[2b]. In another retrospective trial, 3 of 11 patients with NSclC treated with chemotherapy achieved a partial response (44)[2c]. Since these data are not head-to-head comparison, they should be interpreted with caution and may only give a weak idea of what can be achieved with chemotherapy in NSCRC patients with METex14. The risk-free treatment of the risk-benefit analysis is similar to that of the benefit-risk assessment.The risk-risk analysis is based on the following principles: (i) the risk of loss of risk, (ii) the severity of the disease, (iii) the lack of risk (iv) the absence of risk-related effects; (v) the need for a risk-mitigation approach; (vi) the reduction of risk of injury to the patient; (vii) the risks associated with the risk assessment; (iv), the risk reduction in risk-weighted exposure of the patient to the benefit of the individual patient; and (v). In the NCCN guidelines 2024, NTRK-treated treatment with entrectinib and larotractinib is not available. Both treatments are approved by EM NTRK merged NSCLC, based on basket trials. Entrectinib was studied in Phases 1 and 2 basket studies ALKA-372, STARTRK-1 and STARTRk-2 and update data from these studies were published in 2022 (61)[2b]. Out of 121 enrolled patients, 22 NSclC.

The following efficacy data were presented in the studies: ORR 47-50%, PFS 8.2-10.5 months, DOR 8.7-1.2 months and OS 13.8 months. UNICERN study is also a Phase II (66) [2b], single-arm study which examined the efficacy of osimertinib to 40 patients with rare EGFR variants with similar effect, ORR 55%, PF S.5, PFS 9.4 months and DOR 22.7 months. One fourth of the patients had cerebral metastases: PFS 9.4 months. A fifth of patients experience progression in single metastases (≤ 3) under osimertinib-oligo progression According to ESMO and NCCN guidelines, patients may be considered to receive local treatment against oligoprogregating sites under osimitinib. SYSTEMIC PROGRESSION A good half of patients who progress during osimertinib experience systemic progression (>3 progression metastases) (69). The resistance mechanisms of osimetinib are many. It is also recommended that selected patients (relevant residual life, AT and performance status) with systemic progression receive a re-biopsy (the programmering mutations) to rule out transformation to other histology (SCLC or planocellullar carcinoma). Biopsy should also be analysed with a broad NGS panel to investigate for acquired targetable resistance mutations. a.

      "text": "Patients with acquired resistance variants should be offered the inclusion in post-EGFR-TKI protocols, if possible. The majority of patients with systemic progression should be provided with platinum based chemotherapy. If re-biopsy contains targetable resistance mechanisms, consideration may be given to treating the resistance mechanisms as monotherapy or under continued osimertinib (combination TKI). Based on the limited evidence (see below) for efficacy, this treatment cannot be recommended outside clinical trials. The resistance mechanisms under osimatetinib are summarised in 3 review articles from 2023 (67-69) and further studied in the AURA 3 study (70)[1b]. The most frequent targetable variants associated with resistance development under osimetinib are off-target variants, i. e. genetic changes for proteins outside EGFR signal pathway. In this recommendation, only variants are described in clinical studies. MET amplification as resistance mechanism is best studied. See also under recommendation 18 (HER2/ERBB2). Real-world data of Danish patients (case series) show that the combination of EGFR-TKI with Crizotinib can result in PFS between 3-19 months depending on other molecular co-alterations (74) [4].

Immunotherapy for patients with EGFR mutated disease Currently there is no sure evidence that the combination of chemotherapy plus immunotherapy, 2nd-line treatment after EGFR TKI is better than chemotherapy alone. Therefore, immunotherapy in combination or as monotherapy for EGFR Mutated NSCLC is not recommended as the next line treatment for osimertinib. Immune Therapy combined with chemotherapy is available 4 Phase III studies examining the efficacy of chemotherapy in conjunction with PD-L1 inhibitor, 2th-line therapy after progression under EGFR TOMI: IMpower 150, Orient-31, CheckMate 722 and Keynote-789. The results of the study were presented on ASCO 2023 for 492 patients. The study found no significant difference in ORR, PFS or OS. The lack of efficacy was independent of PD-L1 status. Immunotherapy combined with EGFR TKI Combination EGFR TOI plus immunotherapy has been studied in a number of Phase I/II studies (80-85) [3b]. Therefore, it is not recommended to combine immunotherapy with TKI immunotherapy monotherapy for patients with EGF R TKI resistance is generally not recommended due to lack of evidence for efficacy. One phase II study 86 [2dr. The risk-free risk-based approach is based on whether they are due to a change in the ALK gene (on-target) or whether they result from a change of genes associated with the signal pathways independent of ALK (off-target), or histologic transformation (88)[2b]. In the case of progression of the 3rd generation ALK-TKI, lorlatinib, the same reservations as for progression under EGFR-TCI, should be taken into consideration. SYSTEMIC PROGRESSION On-target resistance mechanisms On-stage resistance mechanisms arise as both single-mutations and as multiple mutations developed at the same time (compound mutations) in the AlKK. These acquired mutations are distinct for each ALK‐TKI also within the same generation of ALk-TKI. Therefore, in selected cases, it can make sense to change between the same generations. Histologically speaking, the Histologic study of Histology has been performed with non-celled lung cancer and squamous autocarcinoma has been described during treatment with both lorlatinib, alectinib and brigatinib, although rarely seen.For patients with EGFR mutations, there is no safe data to support the use of immunotherapy in patients with ALK fusion (92)[2b]. In a retrospective study of 42 incurable patients with NSCLC and ALK translocation who received immunotherapy without prior ALK-TKI, a very short PFS (2.3 mdr.) was shown in patients receiving immunotherapy with no prior ALk-TKI and in patients treated with ROK-THI.",

Recommendation 15 Patients with active BRAF v600E previously treated by platinum-based chemotherapy +/- immunotherapy, can be provided with dabrefenib +/ - immunotherapy. Alternatively, encorafenib+ binimitinib, after validation of department management/regional drug selection. Dabrafenib/Trametinib The efficacy of dabraphenib plus Trametinib in BRAFV600E patients mutated NSCLC patients who received prior minimum 1st line therapy, were studied in a Phase 2 study (kohorte B) (40). The results from Phase 2 treated patients were 9.7 months and 11.1 months in 28 treatment-naïve patients; DOR was 5.4 months and 9.7 month, respectively, for treated patients and 12.6 months of treatment-niaïve Patients (100 years of treatment) were 54%, based on 13 patients with cerebral metastases. In the Phase 3 study CodeBreaK 200 patients with advanced NSCLC and KRAS G12C mutation were previously treated with platinum based chemotherapy and immunotherapy randomised to sotorasib or docetaxel (106)[1b]. ORR was 28.1% and DOR 8.6 months in favour of soorasib vs 13.2% and 6.8 months respectively for docetaxel. PFS was significantly increased for sotorasib 5.6 months vs 4.5 months for docexole. There was no significant difference between OS (10.6 months vs 11.3 months vs 11.3 months for sotorasib and docetaxel respectively). This may be due to the fact that the study did not have the strength to examine OS and that 34% of patients in the docetaxel arm received KRA's G12 C directed treatment afterwards. Side effects The adverse event profile was more favorable for sooraseib. A763_Y764insX (46% of all EGFR exon 20 ins variants) located in the helix region has a similar function as the classic EGFR variants and case reports have shown efficacy of EGFR TKIer, also osimertinib (58, 59) [4]. On this basis, consideration can be given to 2nd line osimateinib for this variant during close response monitoring, if osimitinib is not used in 1st line. b. Other EGFR Exon 20 insertions variants For patients with the other EGFRexon 20 Ins variants, one can consider application for single-patient permission in both ESMO and NCCN patients guidelines.

The adverse drug grade ≥ 3: 64%, most frequently neutropenia (33%) and diarrhoea (13%). HER2 receptor double-blockade has limited evidence of efficacy and should only be offered in clinical trials if at all. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) ADCs are antibodies directed to a surface protein (receptor) which is often overexpressed on cancer cells. The antibody (HER2 directed) is linked to further treatment (deruxtecan or emtansine). The studies showed a limited effect. The ZENITH20 studies (116-118)[2b] investigated the efficacy of poziotinib in previously treated and non-previously treated patients with ERBB2 exon 20 induction NSCLC. The studies revealed ORR 27% - 39%, DOR 5.5 months and PFS 5.5 months respectively. Exon 20 insertion variant: G778_P780dupGSP looked like a better effect in the 1st line study (ORR 71%) (116)[26b]. In addition, there are no studies on the management of progression under osimertinib to patients with the other rare variants. Therefore, it should be considered that the effect of osimpinib to the rare EGFR variants is limited in relation to the treatment of the classical EGFR flavors. Monotherapy immunotherapy is not recommended as a rule, see under Recommendation 11. Patient values and preferences There is no expected great variation in patients' preferences as the recommended medicinal products have a better effect and less adverse effects than chemotherapy. Rationale recommendations can only be obtained by prior approval in the regions' medicine committees. In DOLG there is a difference in drug committees' assessments across the regions.",

The Secretariat for Clinical Guidelines in the field of Cancer has made an administrative approval of the content. Further information on clinical guidelines in the area of cancer can be found in: The guideline is targeted clinical working health professionals in the Danish healthcare sector and contains systematically prepared statements that can be used as decision support for the specific clinical situation that is crucial to the decision on appropriate and correct health care provision in specific clinical situations. There is no guarantee of successful treatment results, even if health professionals follow the recommendations. In some cases, the guidelines are not legally binding and it will always be the scientific judgement in the specific medical situation that determines the appropriate and proper health provision.
