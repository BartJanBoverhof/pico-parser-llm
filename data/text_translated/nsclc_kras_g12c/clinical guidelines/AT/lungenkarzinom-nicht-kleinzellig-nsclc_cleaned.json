Screening asymptomatic risk persons by means of a low-dose computer tomogra- phy can detect lung carcinoma in early stages and reduce lung cancer mortality in smokers and to an even greater extent in smokers, but has not yet been implemented as an early detection program in the German-speaking countries. Lung carcinoma is a prime example of the development of modern oncology. Until recently, in two main diagnoses (small cell and non-small cell lung carcinoma), the lung carcinoma is today divided into numerous biologically different entities with their own treatment concepts. The prognosis of the patient and patients (Pat.) is often combined with the stage, the molecular subtype, the histology, the gender, the general condition and the comorbidity.",

Molecular analyses increasingly lead to a diversification of the so far histologically shaped subdivisions. They show different pathogenetic pathways, e.g. between smokers and non-smokers, but also within the histological subgroups. For some of the central oncogeneous Trei- bermutations, targeted drugs are available. The interaction with the immune system is also relevant for the spread of the tumour cells.",

Overall, smoking, in particular in active form but also as passive smoking, is by far the most important risk factor. These include all forms of inhaled tobacco consumption, including water whistles (shisha). The interaction of smoking with other exogenous or endogenous risk factors is not conclusively clarified, with reference to a over-additive effect, e.g. as an occupational disease is lung cancer in Germany by arsenic, asbestos, cadmium, cadmium, carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide.",

Increased consumption of fruit and vegetables reduces the risk of lung cancer, especially among smokers. Randomized studies in lung cancer risk persons do not have a positive preventive effect for the intake of β-carotene, various forms of retinoids, vitamin E, folic acid, tea extracts, selenium, N-acetylcysteine, acetylsalicylic acid, metformin, celecoxib, inhaled steroids and other substances [135].

The calculations of the median time between first, imagingly detectable changes and the clinical diagnosis of lung cancer (sojourn time) vary greatly and lie for computer tomography between 1.38 and 3.86 years [34]. In the German-speaking European area no measures for targeted early detection of lung cancer have been implemented so far. The mesothelioma screening programs of the SUVA (Swiss Accident Insurance Institute) for persons with asbestos contact and the German legal accident insurance in occupationally exposed risk persons also detect per sons with lung cancer. Previous approaches to the use of X-rays of the thorax or the sputumcytology had no significant influence on the reduction of mortality. Early detection by means of low dose computer tomography (CT) of the thorax increased the detection rate of lung cancer in a risk population.",

With the entry into force of the BMUV legal regulation on 1 July 2024, early lung cancer detection for risk persons by means of low-dose CT examination in Germany is in principle permitted – under the conditions set out in the legal regulation. The exact implementation provisions and in particular the conditions of reimbursement are currently laid down by the G-BA. The combination with an offer for smoking cessation is planned.

The risk of developing lung carcinoma is approximately 2-7 times higher in the HIV positive population than in the general population [152]. The median age of disease is 45 years, and is significantly lower than in HIV-negative patients [16]. More than half of the patients have stage III or IV of the disease at the time of diagnosis. Histologically, most of them are adenocarcinoma, followed by squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and small cell lung carcinoma. HIV-typical histopathies do not occur at the time of diagnosis. Most patients with HIV-associated lung carcinoma should be expected to receive HAART. This should be continued without the possibility of treatment with HAART.",

They can be alleviated by targeted rehabilitation measures in the somatic and psychosocial areas. Pat. should be informed about the possibilities of outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation measures as well as other claims arising from the social law at an early stage. Regarding the rehabilitation clinic, the wishes of Pat. should be taken into account (§9 SGB IX). Nevertheless, a recommendation for a clinic with an oncological focus should be given in order to ensure an optimal rehabilitation success.",

In patients with lung cancer, the value of an intensive, structured follow-up care with respect to an extension of the survival time is not assured. After curative therapy, the goal of the follow-up care is also the early diagnosis of a second tumor. In patients with recidiv or a second carcinoma, there is a curative potential. In these patients, the follow-up care interval can be reduced to 6-8 weeks [117]. Recommendations for conventional, structured follow-up after therapy in curative intention are summarised in Table 12.

In the expert consensus, the S3 guideline recommends the reduction of the three-month to shorter, 6-8-week intervals [117]. Data from prospective studies on the optimal follow-up interval when using the current therapy options are not yet available. Promising, new options for Pat. in the palliative situation are the personalized monitoring of the patient and the disease progression by means of web-based instruments. In a French study, Pat. were randomized in advanced stages without disease progression between a weekly, web-based self-assessment and a standardized 3- and 6-month CT control. Pat. in the experimental arm had a significantly longer, median survival (HR 0.32; median 7 months) [28]. Current data from the USA support these results. The patient's satisfaction of video-received patients was not advanced at the time of the patient's consultation.",
