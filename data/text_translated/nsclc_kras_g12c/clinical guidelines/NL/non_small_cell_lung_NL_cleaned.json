More information about lung cancer can be found on cancer. The initiative for this directive comes from the Dutch Association of Doctors for Longzie Tuberculosis (NVALT).The directive is part of the cluster Longoncology modular approach The directive has been drawn up by a multidisciplinary committee with representatives from among others d lung doctors, surgeons, pathologists, radiotherapists, oncologists, thorax surgeons and nuclear medicine radiologists and nurses and nurses involved.Long cancer The Netherlands is involved as a patient organisation in the development of the directive. et- eincel.

In 2012 it was diagnosed in 6,947 men and 4,924 women lung cancer. The total number of patients with lung cancer increased between 2000 and 2019 by 53% from 8,959 to 13,792. In men, the increase in this period was 16% and lung carcinoma is still the main cause of death due to cancer (25%). In women, this is more than doubled in the same period and lung cancer has now been responsible for 21% of the total cancer mortality. In 2011-2017 the 1-year survival of all patients with NS CLC 48%; the 5-year survival rate is 22%. In the first case, chemoradiotherapy and sometimes surgery is possible; in the latter case, systemic treatment is used. In oligometastases, local therapy can be added. Part of the potentially resectable patients is not eligible for surgical treatment due to co-morbidity, limited functional reserve and poor performance status because the risk of death or permanent disability is considered too high [Damhuis 1996(1; Janssen-Heijnen 1998(4)]. There are only small shifts in the distribution of stages of disease, including through diagnostic progress and the new stage classification of NSCLC (see module TNM Classification). Pathogenesis Various factors contribute to the development of lung carcinoma. These are smoking [Molina 2008(7)], chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) [Collins 2007(6), asbestos exposure, air pollution such as fine particulate matter (fine particles) with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 (PM) or even 2.5 micrometers, and genetic factors [Molic 2008((8)]. According to a large European study, the lung carcinoma risk is associated with air pollution (HR 1.22; 95% CI., 1.03-1.45) per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM . That risk is lower than the risk of smoking for which the relative risk is 23.3 and 12.7 for current male and female smokers respectively [Raaschou-Nielsen 2013(9) . However, the overall risk from air pollution is high, given that everyone is exposed to it. The risk from lung cancer in the Netherlands is 80 to 85% related to smoking and at least 8% related to fine dust, especially in the adenocarcinomas [WHO 2009; Beelen 2014(5) ]. Approximately 10% of smokers develop lung cancer during their lifetime. Smoking and non-smoking related lung cancer are distinguished disease images with a different range of DNA mutations; these diseases need different treatments. Recommendation Lung Carcinoma screening is advised in high-risk groups, by centres that have a low-dose CT and specific software. In addition, there must be knowledge and competence for screening. Stop smoking is an integral part of screening. Considerations There are strong indications that with better definition of the risk profile of a nodus additional diagnostics can be limited. Also, there are indications from the NELSON trial that fewer follow-up diagnostics are required than in the NLST trial. That means that the cost effectiveness will be improved and the radiation load will decrease. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual screening with a low dose CT for age category 55 - 80 years with 30 pack years of years of being and smoking or have stopped smoking in the past 15 years. Screening should be stopped if 15 years of non-smoking or if there is a health problem where life expectancy is limited. In any screening of smokers, it was important to pay close attention at the same time to smoking cessation. This approach would increase the cost-effectiveness of screening by 20 - 45% [Villanti Screening of nodules with a low-dose CT requires expertise in volume measurements. Support Conclusions There are indications that screening with low-dosing CT reduces mortality due to lung cancer. NLST 2011(3) Summary literature Although some scientific associations recommend lung cancer screening in high-risk groups (with non-small cell lung cancer mainly smokers and ex-smokers who stopped smoking ≤10 years ago), there are still uncertainties as to the value of these recommendations for clinical practice. The recommendation is based in particular on the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) by 53.454 participants, which showed a decrease in lung cancer specific mortality by 20% through application of low-dose CT with a well-trained staff [NSLT 2011(4). In the context of a population survey on lung carcinoma, the Dutch-Leuven lung cancer Screening Research (NELSON) is conducted. In this randomised study, the nodule volume is measured with a low-dose CT; in both arms the advice is given to stop smoking. Participants are positive if the nodule volume >500mm (diameter approximately 9.8mm) is or the volume doubling time (VDT) < 400 days. These stricter requirements lead to a positive screen at 485 (6%) of the 7582 participants after which it is determined at 200 (2.6%) participants lung carcinoma. The positive predictive value of the screening is 40.6% and 1.2% of all scans are error-positive. Over a period of more than 5 years, the risk of determining lung carcinoma by screening is different and depending on the outcome of the first scan, 1% risk after a negative scan, 5.7% after a positive result. In other American analyses it appears that the number of patients with higher stages has increased by 0.1 years, while the expected cost saving was € 61.-. An American study finds lower costs associated with selective use of FDG-PET in patients with normal mediastinal lymph nodes and a T1-tumour on CT (33). In other US analyses, the number to increase since the introduction of F DG-PET is also increased by 0,1 years, whereas the expected costs of cost reduction was €61.-, whereas a US study associated with a selective use for patients with a normal mediastinal lymphatic gland and a CT (33) has been shown to be higher. A new modularity in the urbanisation of NSCLC has been found in the same order as the FDG-PET (35). However, more research is needed to determine the location of this modality in lung cancer. Since there is often an indication for both CT and FDG PET in patients with NSCLEC, it is efficient to combine an FDG PET with a CT with diagnostic quality in one session. Whether this is feasible depends on local conditions, such as the logistics surrounding access to the F DG-PET-CT, the access times to a CT alone, the quality of the CT present in the FDD-PET device, the possibility of contrast application and the availability of integrated radiological and nuclear medicine assessment. If preferred, the FDC-PET should result in an integrated nuclear radiology report. Underbuilding Conclusions FDG-PET is more sensitive to detecting mediastinal lymph node metastases than a CT. Level 1: A1 Gould 2003, (12) Silvestri 2007, (13) Ung 2007, (14) Dwamena 1999; (11) A2 Pieterman 2000. (9) The FDG PET has a greater susceptibility to demonstrating mediastinal metastasis (>95%) with a lower specificity (about 78%) if the FDG PET positive glands on the CT are also enlarged. Level1: A1 Gould 2003; (12) A2 Yang 2008. (18) The F DG-PET-CT stadiate patients with an NSCLC more accurate than with an FDG PET alone.

(27) Summary literature FDG-PET FDG is a glucose analogue, for which malignant cells have an increased affinity.The radiation load of an FDG PET is about 19 microSievert/Megabecquerel.Because of increasing sensitivity of the detectors, the amount of FDG administered has been reduced to approx. 200-400 MBq in recent years and the radiation load at this dose is 4-7 mSv. Anno 2010 has been replaced by combined PET-CT devices, with both PET and CT being performed in one session. In the same session, a so-called low-dose CT is produced (ray load approx. 1-3 mSf) used for the required weakening correction of the FDG PET images and for the determination of the anatomical localizations with increased metabolic activity. From a generous amount of systematic literature reviews, meta-analyses, diagnostic accuracy studies, scenario analysis studies and outcome studies (including some new randomised studies). (1) (2) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (10). The picture that emerges from this confirms that the FDG-PET is more sensitive for thestading of the mediastinal than the CT. Qualitative meta-analysises from 1999 of Dwamena (11)14 and 2003 of Gould (12) were confirmed in 2007 by Silvestri (13) and by Ung (14). The sensitivity of FDG‐PET for the detection of mediastinal lymph node metastases is 75-85%, and the specificity of 75-90%. For the CT of the antimicrobialum is 50-75% in a specificity of F DG-PET-CT for mediastinal metastase (15) (17) Studies show that FDG -PET is combined with a better diagnostic quality than an FDG PE-T with only a lower rate. However, a qualitatively good primary diagnostic accuracy study with FDG-PET-CT compared the performance of the FDG‐PET component of FDG PET-CT with CT alone (18). A total sensitivity for mediastinal metastases of 92% was measured with a specificity of 84%, at the level of individual mediastinal lymph nodes. For CT alone, 74% and 59% were found. For the distinction between N0 or N1 versus N2 disease, the sensitivity of F DG-PET -CT is 72%, specificity 89%. For CT alone this is 52% and 73%. With mediastinaloscopy and -tomy as a golden standard, 80% of patients with FDC-PET CT-CT have been properly staged (CT 56%), 7% have been understated (CT 26%) and 13% oversted (CT 18%). The combination of the FDG-PET and CT component, however, leads to better diagnostic quality. Cerfolio has found that the F DG-PET-CT is a better predictor for Stage I and II than FDG -PET alone (Stage I: 52 versus 33% correct predictions; in Stage II this is 70 versus 36%) (15). Probably for the T-stage and certainly for the N-status, the FDC-PET CT improves diagnostics compared to the FDF-PET alone. Meanwhile, the results of three randomized studies comparing with FDG PET-CT with conventional stadification without FDG PET have been found in two of these randomised studies which have shown that the fDG-PT-CT reduces the number of unnecessary thoracotomys (19) (20), just like that in a study from the FDO-PET era alone (21). The diagnostic quality of the FDG-PET-CT further improves if the data from the diagnostic contrast CT are combined with the F DG-PET data. As is well known, the FDC-PET can give false negative results in small dimensions of metastases (< 6-8 mm) or in small metastatic foci in larger lymph nodes. Error-positive results occur in inflammation or infection in glands (sarcoidosis, tuberculosis etc.). Although also the density distribution in tumours or lymph node metastasis plays a role in the CT, the assessment on metastatics is still mainly based on size. Therefore, the CT can provide both error-negative results in lymph nodes ≤ 10 mm and error-positive in glands > 10 mm. In the study of Yang with FDG -PET- CT, an extensive analysis of asymptomatic glands was performed in which of all individual glands was available a FDG PET-CT and histology (18). These data are based on individual lymph nodes and not on the patient's TNM data. From the data it can be calculated that if on the CT there are no enlarged mediastinal glands and the FDG-PET is positive (metabole activity shows), 56% of the lymph nodes show a metastasis, and if FDG -PET is negative then only in 3% there is metastasic. If the CT shows enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, and the fDG-PET is positive too, then the probability of metastase is 75%. If FDG‐PET is not small cell lung carcinoma negative in enlarged mediastinal lymphatic glands on the CT then the likelihood of metastatic is 11%. These data correspond fairly to the older data from the meta-analysis of Gould 2(3). In summary, the negative predictive value of the FDG-PET-CT for the mediastinal is therefore 85-95%.FDG-PET for metastases at a distance In addition to the value for stadting the mediastinal, the F DG-PET is also suitable for detecting distance metastasis (25). Newer literature confirms the previous conclusion that the FDC-PET CT detects unexpected distance metstatics in 10-20% of patients (13). This percentage is higher in patients with higher stages. Lardinois has found 110 abnormalities outside the thorax in 350 patients (16). In 21% this is a solitary deviation of 54% related to lung cancer and 46% related to another malignancy, benign and premalign colon polyps, Warthin's salival gland tumours, granulomas, hyperplastic thyroid nodi, inflammation or benign diseases. The accuracy of the fDG-PT to show adrenal metastas is 100% but this concerns deviations > 15 mm (5). Although error positivity is rare, a biopsy is performed to confirm it. This is true for any solitary metastatic lesion. For detecting brain metastases, the FDG-PET and the F DG-PET-CT is not appropriate due to the high background activity of brain tissue; the MRI is the research of choice here. The FDG‐PET is suitable for detecting skeletal metastasis in which sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value and accuracy are all > 90% (5). This exceeds the diagnostic performance of a skeleton scintigraphy. For demonstrating brain and liver metastase, FDG -PET has no added value over the respective MRI and three-phase CT. Furthermore, the MR is more sensitive than the CT for demonstrating bone marrow metastass. CT is suitable to demonstrate skeleta metastasi enlargement (frature threat). In selective cases, the MR can be used to differentiate small liver lesions. Solitarian lung nodus In practice, the fDG-PT-CT also uses a long hair for assessing the purpose of solitar. This probability can be calculated on the basis of clinical and radiological factors (Wish criteria: age patient, smoking, size, location in upper lobe and spiculation on CT (26)).A stadiuming indication could be a discordant result of FDG-PET and CT.In the current FDG‐PET-CT era, the combination of the FDG PET and CT led to a sensitivity for detecting a small pulmonary malignancy of more than 95% and a specificity of 89% (27). Also in Dutch research, the combination of the wishes criteria with FDG PET led to the highest diagnostic value (28).The negative predictive value of an FDG PET is low as on a CT a small solitary pulmonary need (< 1 cm) is seen; however, the positive predictive value for a small lesion is again high. FDG-PET is recommended to remotely exclude metastases prior to intentional curative treatment. It is preferable to use a post-contrast MRI when screening for brain metastasis. The sensitivity of a post contrast MRI can be increased by using a double dose contrast or, if available, by using the MTC technique. For logistical reasons, also, it can be chosen for post-Contrast CT, preferably with a double-dose contrast. The clinical value of newer MRI techniques is not yet clear, but perfusion and diffusion MRI may contribute to the differentiation between therapy effects and actual progression (see the brainmetastases Directive). Considerations There are few data on the value of individual risk factors in relation to performed diagnostic tests. Furthermore, the criteria for test positivity of the various studies in the literature vary. hoarseness, a vena cava superior syndrome and specific complaints such as bone pain, neurological symptoms and symptoms, hepatomegaly and increased alkaline phosphatase, calcium, gamma-GT and AST. Level 2: A2 Beckles 2003; (2) B Silvestri 1995, (1) Hillers 1994, (3) Toloza 2003; (20) C Canadian Lung Oncology Group 2001 (6). In an intended curative treatment, visual diagnostics to distance metastases to skeletal, liver, adrenal or brain with FDG-PET and/or MRI of the brain are required. Level 1: A2 Pietermann 2000 (21) Summary literature At presentation, approximately one third of patients with NSCLC symptoms have remote metastass. Where organ-specific symptoms and findings often show signs of dissemination, it is otherwise known to be associated with nonspecific factors that are associated with an increased risk of non-small pulmonary carcinoma, such as anaemia and weight loss (1). If liver and adrenal glands have been examined in the initial CT, they are therefore separate studies of bone and brain metastases (2).The yield in a population without risk factors is low (in squamous cell carcinomas <5%, in adenocarcinoma slightly higher). Meta-analyses suggest a negative predictive value of the total dissemination study of at least 90% (3) (4). However, the precision of this estimate suffers from the variation in the quality of the gold standard and patient groups studied. In a Canadian randomised study, patients with no clinical indication of extrathoracic metastase have been investigated whether an algorithm with CT-thorax followed by mediastinalscopy is more unnecessary than when skeletal scans, CT of brain, liver, and adrenals have been added (6). More extrathoral metastass were found in the intensively screened group (7% versus 3%; p=0.04), but no significant difference in open-close operations, incomplete resections and relapses after resection (relative risk: Verification of results of dissemination studies Since no test has a sufficiently low error positivity, it is almost always necessary to establish the nature of abnormalities found. This makes it clear that the disadvantage of felineroutine dissemination studies in each patient': except for costs, this inevitably generates delay and morbidity due to the additional tests (with relatively high error positiveness in low advance probability) (8). Also when stratified application of dissemination studies, tissue verification of observed abnormalities remains necessary. Nevertheless, there is a number of basic principles. In a patient with thoracic pathology suspected and the diagnosis is not clear will be required, a CT of the thorax/ upper abdomen with contrast (note to contra-indications such as renal impairments). In a patients who may be eligible for a surgical, chemotherapy or stereotactical treatment an FDG PET/diagnotic CT is indicated as the first imaging study. Several studies show that there is too little dissimination research in this group, especially when considering combination treatments (8). A skeletal scan is only made if there is a high suspicion of bone metastases (e.g. hypercalcaemia), because a bone scan is cheaper than an FDG-PET. An enlarged adrenal gland in standard CT-study is more benign than malignant. Especially adenomas can give typical images on CT and MRI due to their high fat content (showable by respectively density measurement - without intravenous contrast - and hydroxyphenylchemical shift-imaging'). These findings are not considered to be small cell lung carcinoma quantitatively expressed; however, the criteria for test positivity vary in the literature. However, it is often necessary to provide a puncture or biopsy to provide certainty. The same applies to liver abnormalities where image-forming research is not considered conclusive (9). For typification of brain abnormalities, FDG-PET (15) (16) (17) has no value as a result of the high physiological FDG uptake in the brain (14). There is not much direct comparative study between skeletal scintigraphy and FDG -PET (15). Usually, the studies in which the tests in a number of tumour types have been examined, including tumors that are notoriously poor can accumulate FDG (prostatic, mammacarcinoma). The results suggest a much better specificity of FDG PET in a slightly variable sensitivity. FDG PET is in favour of osteoblastic osteoblasts. The literature on liver metastases is largely based on experience in colorectal tumours, which have an adequate affinity for FDG as well as lung cancer in general. The data suggest that FDG‐PET has no added value when screening for liver metstatics (than with a lesser status of the art' CT) (18). References 1 - Silvestri GA, Littenberg B, Colice GL.

Initiating question Which laboratory research should be done in patients who have evidence of pulmonary carcinoma? Recommendation All patients with evidence of lung cancer should have a limited laboratory examination of at least haemoglobin, calcium, albumin, sodium, lactate-dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase. More extensive laboratory research is carried out to estimate organ functions before treatment. Considerations Laboratory research is conducted not due to urbanisation purposes, but in particular for differential diagnostic reasons and as preparation for treatment. Due to logistical reasons, it is possible to carry out practically different determinations. All available guideline documents state that serum calcium concentration and alkaline phosphatase are important in detecting skeletal metastases. Sensitivity does not appear to be high: only with extensive skeleton metastasis there are increased levels of alkaline phosphatase and calcium. The liver function tests for liver metastase are even more valid. All other laboratory parameters, including tumour markers, have no value. The studies of different biomarkers are of different quality and often not validated (3). Elevated serum calcium concentrations can also be a sign of paraneoplastic syndrome. Laboratory tests do make sense as therapeutic or prognostic considerations. In chemotherapy, the function of the bone marrow, kidney and liver is important. Reduced serum concentrations of sodium, albumin and haemoglobin and elevated lactate hydrogenase values have a negative significance. Finally, the characteristic of Non-small cell lung carcinoma is that the concentration in serum changes as the tumour volume increases or decreases. This means that an increased value for a R0 resection has a little predictive value, but a postoperative persistent increased value means a high risk of short survival (National Academy Clinical Biochemistry. Laboratory Practical Guidelines 2003). In short, tumor markers have little to no value for diagnostics and in specific situations and for follow-up light a limited value.

In patients over 80 years of age without major comorbidity and in good condition, a resection as a treatment modality should also be considered, if physician and patient consider the surgical risk acceptable. Cardiovascular risk factors Preoperatively, a cardiologist, an intensive care medical or anesthesiologists should assess the perioperative risk and advise on the perisurgical policy in the case of intended pulmonary surgery and (suspecting) a heart disease. Lung function study If the forced-expiration volume in one second (FEV) and the diffusion capacity (TLCO) are both > 80% and there is no unexpected dyspnoea d'effort, the surgery risk is not considered to be increased. If these criteria are not met, then the calculation method (perfusion with left-right ratio and lobectomy supplemented with the segments) should be used to calculate the post-operative function on the basis of the substance. In patients with an increased operating risk, alternatives such as a more limited resection or chemo- and/or radiotherapy or stereotactical radiotherapy should be considered against surgery with increased risk. Considerations Lung function studies Various studies have shown a link between TLCO and perioperative risk. In addition to this provision, the FEV is included as a standard test in the recommendations. In the more recent literature, the trend is not small cell lung cancer to use absolute lung function values as a limit value, but the percentage of predicted value (%pred). In case of impaired lung function (FEV and/ or TL CO < 80% of predicted) the predicted postoperative lung function should be calculated with the calculation method (quantitative perfusion method). In the event of doubt, if the exercise tolerance appears much better or much worse than is expected on the basis of lung function, or in other situations where there is an increased risk, the forecast postoperative pulmonary function (FEV ppo and TLco ppo) should be evaluated with the maximum accuracy. Underbuilding Conclusions Age Over 70 years, the perisurgical risk for lung surgery has been increased even more.

However, literature and an internationally accepted directive on the assessment of the cardiac risk for non-cardiac surgery (including lung surgery) has been found to be able to make recommendations based on these guidelines. C. Lung function study There were sufficient data available for a risk assessment of perioperative mortality as a function of age and pulmonary function parameters forced-expiration volume in one second (FEV), diffusion capacity (TLCO) and maximum oxygen intake (VO max). For other lung function parameters and for blood gas values at rest or during effort, there are no or insufficient indications for an influence on the operating risk in the literature. For other factors that may affect the operating risks, such as diet, decanoate performance' status and other co-morbidity, no literature was found specifically for lung surgery. For these factors, no extrapolation has been attempted from the general surgical literature. In other studies, a slightly higher mortality rate is often found (2) (3). Recent Dutch studies show a 30-day surgical mortality rate of 7.5% in patients over 75 years of age (5). This increased risk in elderly people is probably due mainly to higher co-morbidity. Among other data from the Flemish cancer registration, the incidence of surgery has been increased especially in right-sided pneumonectomy: at all ages 10.6% and over 70 years 17.8% versus 3.9 and 8.1% respectively post-operative mortality rate for left-sided pneumonia (3). For patients over 80 years old, lung surgery, especially lobectomy and smaller resections in relatively small studies described a perioperative mortality level of 4-B. Cardiovascular risk factors There is no Dutch directive for preoperative cardiovascular evaluation. There are few specific data for the estimation of cardiovascular risk in lung surgery. The estimated postoperative ejection rate is the best measure for estimation of the cardiac residual function. C. Lung function study Figure 1: Flow diagram for the determination of peroperative risk for lung surgery, by means of lung function analysis. FEV = forced expiration volume in one second TLCO = difussion capacity VO max = maximum oxygen uptake The calculation method means that the relative functional contributions of the right and left lung wo are calculated using the perfusion scan, in lobectomy the functional contribution of the remaining lobe is calculated by dividing the number of remaining segments by the total of segments. Use of the flow schedule is recommended to evaluate the perioperative risk. Older studies have shown that there is no increased operating risk if the FEV is for a n orders ben) numerous Not small cell lung carcinoma pneumonectomy is greater than 2 l (for a lobecctomy: > 1.5 l) (12). However, in recent studies a FEV above 80% of the predicted value and a normal TL CO are found to be safe In patients with impaired lung function in different studies with a tL-cell function of FEV and FEV can be obtained from the TL. This ppo value can also be calculated by means of the segments method (16) (17), quantitative ventilation scan (18) (19), or quantitative CT (20). However, in most cases, the calculation method is used for the calculation of the FEV ppo and TLCO ppo: the relative functional contribution of the right and left lung is calculated by the perfusion scan, and in (bi)lobectomy, the functional contribution from the remaining lobes is calculated using the segments methodology (the number of remaining segments divided by the total number of segments). In this case, most studies show that if the FEVA ppo is > 40% and the TL CO ppo > 40%, there is no increased risk for resection (14) (16) (21) (22) (22) (22) (24). If FEV ppo is < 30% or if both the Fev ppo as the TlCO ppos is < 40%, the surgery risk is increased in 1 1st examination (14) (16) (22) (25) (27) (27). However, in two other studies involving patients with a mean FEV ppo of 31% and 24% respectively of the predicted value, good results (no increased perioperative mortality) of lobectomy of a poorly perfused lobe and pulmonary volume reduction surgery combined with resection of suspicious nodules (29) (30) were described. In patients with an FEV ppo < 40%, a TLCO ppo < 40% or unexpected dyspnoea d'effort can be attempted by means of an exercise test to estimate the peri-operative risk. Although a number of studies show that the number of stairs that a patient may experience is associated with the perisurgical risk, in most studies a bicycle test is used to measure the VO max. In a VO maximum > 20 ml/min/kg there is no increased risk of lung surgery (pneumonectomy or smaller resections) (31) (32). In that study, also two patients with a good FEV (2.5-3 l) and such poor VO max. Bolliger et al. have calculated a VO Max ppo using VOmax 2 2 2 and lung perfusion scan (14). In this study, there was no perioperative mortality at a FO max ppo > 10 ml/min/kg and a high mortality at VO maximum ppo < 10 ml /min/ kg. Not all studies found a relationship between VO Maximum and peri surgical mortality/morbidity (14). Although in most studies the VO-max is expressed in ml/ min/kg, it is also argued that the predicted value of the FOmax should be included in the calculation, since in the former one would not be taken into account under- or overweight, gender and age. In these studies it is suggested to maintain a Vo max ppos of 35% of the predicted limit value. It is wise to decide in advance what degree of parenchymresection seems justified; is also a bilobectomy or pneumonectomy functionally possible? The high mortality of a right pneumonecctomy after pretreatment should be explicitly addressed in the recitals. If the risk is increased, the team of treatment workers should decide whether this risk is considered acceptable, or whether they should prefer alternatives such as a more limited resection or chemo- and/or radiotherapy. After explaining the nature and risk of the operation to the patient, the latter should be asked whether they agree to the proposed treatment.

Which lymphatic studies are necessary for adequate urbanization? Version 2011 An important part of the contemporary city is based on the determination of the N-statusation in patients with NSchol. The microscopic examination routinely includes an HE (haematoxyline eosin)-colored coupe. In 20-40%, sufficient tissue or tumor cells should be submitted for adequate pathology and mutation analysis. Stage I patients, with a N0 status, show a local recurrence or metastases in the follow-up; •under-staging •in this subgroup appears to be a real problem [Gu 2002(2)]. Using more sensitive techniques including additional series of cross-sections colored with HE and additional immunohistochemistry and/or (part of) lymph gland using molecular techniques, looking at the expression of specific (epithelial) mRNA of metastatic tumour cells, more (occulte) metastass are detected. In the main studies examining the presence of tumour cells in the hilarious and/or mediastinal lymph nodes of patients with a NSCLC with these sensitive techniques [Liptay 2002(3); Gu 2002(2); Izbicki 1996(4); Maruyama 2000(5); Kawano 2002(6); Osaki 2002(7); Oosterhuis 2001(8); Chen 1993(9); Dobashi 1997(10); Hashimoto 2000(11); Sioris 2000(12); Nicholson 1997(13); Osaki 2002,(7), Marchevsky 2003(22); Nosotti 2005(15); Melfi 2008(16), as mentioned in the Directive 2004], there was an average of 38.5% (range 0-77,8%)  piece-staging. In the recent literature, the serial throughs with HE in combination with an immunology of 17% and 22, with respect to which it was not possible to compare their specific properties with the micro-sens. In some studies, a correlation with a significant effect on recurrence or survival is described [ Nosotti 2005(15); Yasumoto 2003(17) ], a part does not show correlation, and some does not display any outcome data. Although studies indicate that additional techniques contribute to the detection of occult metastases, the clinical significance of these occult metastatics is not yet fully crystallized [Nosotti 2005-[15); Marchevsky 2003(14); Nicholson 1997(25; 13); Osaki 2002(7); Saintigny 2005(18); Wang 2005(19); Effenberger 2007(20); Rena 2007(21); Melfi 2008(16); Saintigney 2005(17); Marchevsky 2010(22). 2. What is the importance of Entertainment in the treatment choice? Version 2011 In the past, the distinction between SCLC and NSCLC in the operative assessment was sufficient for a treatment with o.a systemic therapy. It should be noted that NSCLC is not a small cell lung cancer diagnosis, but a collective name for squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and large cell lung carcinoma. Since biopsies with haematoxyline eosinic staining (HE) are more difficult to distinguish between adenocarcoma and squamose cell carcinoma than in resections (20-40%), a recent Dutch study shows that a panel of additional colors on biopsys allows a better differentiation between adeno- and squamsel cell differentiation: slime colouring, cytokeratine 7 and TTF1 colouring helps for adenodifferentiation, and p63 for squame cell differentiation [Thunises 2011(24)]. A uniform coloring pattern is present and helpful [Nicholson 2010(25); Khayata 2009(26] In the case of cytokerate 7 and CTF1 colouration is preferred for endodifferation. In 5-20% of the cases, this is not unique (double negative or double positive) then NSCLC-NOS (not otherwise specified) is mentioned in the conclusion. This additional panel limits a group of squamous cell carcinomas in which the risk of an EGFR/CRAS mutation is very low. Additional version 2015 Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) without convincing differentiation is called on biopsies NSCLEC not otherwise specified (NS CLC-NOS). In order to distinguish between adenocarcinoma or squamonic cell carcinoma, colorings are performed (TTF1, mucine and p40/p63). If one of the adenomarkers is positive, the diagnosis NSCOLC is preferred for adenocarccinoma. If p40 or p63 (difus strongly coloring), the diagnosis of NSclC is favorite for plaque cell carcinoma [Nicholson 2010(25), Bishop 2012(74), Mukhopadhyay 2011(83), Nonaka 2012(86(Pebass].

Baseline question What is the intraoperative assessment of type resection and irresectability per tumor status? Recommendation In operable patients with a NSCLC whose growth is limited to one lobe, a lobectomy with systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection is the treatment of choice. Patients with such limited lung function that a lobectomy is not possible - if surgery is considered - are eligible for a segment resection or possibly wigexcision, if the tumor can be fully reset. Stereotactic radiotherapy should be considered (for argumentation see further in the guideline). If a lung tumor grows through a lobes in a adjacent lobe in principle, alobectomy with a wigregectomy from the adjacent lobes is performed. If it is a central tumor, a tumor is chosen for bilectomy, if it is considered for growth of pneumoc. a conventional lobectomy is not possible, it is recommended that a lung tumor be placed in the direction of the thorax wall if there is doubt as to whether the tumor is growing due to the pleura parietalis, directly chosen for the lung function of the patient's pneumonectomy' take away from the affected part of the chest wall. If peroperatively it appears that a tumor grows to the intrapericardial area of the pulmonary artery, it may often be possible to carry out a pneumonecctomy. If a peroperative lung tumour is found to extend to or in the main carina, which makes a conventional pneumoneectomy impossible, then an attempt is made to obtain a spinal sleeve-lobectomy. If peroperatively it appears that a lung tumor grows to the spine or substantially into the left atrium, it is only rarely resectable. If persurgery shows that a pulmonary tumour is growing to the truncus pulmonalis or through the entire wall of the aorta or has led to pleuritis carcinomamatosa, then there is irresectibility. This may also apply to growth in the oesophagus pulmonalis. If more tumors appear in one lobe (T3), a lobectomy is performed. If multiple tumors occur in different lobes (T4), a primary resection is an option. Considerations 1. T1-T2-tumors, limited to parenchym If the tumor can be completely resected by means of a resection that is more limited than lobecctomy in patients who are pulmonary compromised, then the N1-status cannot give rise to the resection further. According to the working group, the percentage of \"sleeve' resections carried out by surgeons varies considerably.This indicates that it is not always possible to determine whether a \"sloeve\" resection belongs to the possibilities. 3. The growth of tumor pleura parietalis and thorax wall The dilemma during the procedure often consists of whether the tumor growth is limited to the pleura perietalis or extends further to the chest wall.The strategy can be to always start an extrapleural resection.If freezer coupe research shows further expansion, a thorac wall resection can still be carried out.Although not everyone shows that this tumor spill is the prognosis, it is generally assumed that it involves a large resection area, which cannot be investigated in its totality with freezer coupe research. In addition, it causes a tumor cells in this way. For the decision during the procedure, this is of little importance, because in most cases there is no technical problem and these structures can easily be involved in the resection. 5. T4 tumors For all T4 tumours, it is important that large interventions are involved in which the expertise and experience of the operator play an important role and the concept of the irresectable is determined by the skill of the surgeon. Often, preoperatively, it can be an estimate of the difficulty level. This form of lung surgery should take place in a centre. In open thorax, it often requires a lot of preparation work in large and/or nearby tumors before a complete resection can be properly assessed. It is incorrect to qualify a tumor based on volatile inspection as an irresectable. Underbuilding Conclusions In patients with a T1N0 or T2N0-NSCLC, a lobectomy offers the best prognosis and therefore the lowest chance of local recurrence. In patients with a T1N0 or T2N0-NSCLC, however, there is preferably a segment resection or possibly a wigexcision, provided that the resection is complete. Level 2: B Erret 1985, (2) Pastorino 1991, (13) Weissberg 1993, (4) Landreneau 1997, (7) Jeremic 2002. (61) In a lung tumor that is based on a lobe and has grown in a adjacent lobe, a lobectomy with a wigeexcision probably gives the same results as a pneumonectomy. In this consideration, the postoperative morbidity and mortality of a coronarysleeve'-resection are less than a pneumoncectomy, while the 5-year survival is comparable. Level 3: C Okada 1999, (62) Ginsberg 1983, (14) Alexiou 2003. (15) The postoperative malformations and mortality rate of a pneumonesleve' resection are lower than a pneumonia. Level 3: C Vogt-Moykopf 1983, (32) Read 1993, (33) Rendina 1999. (35) In the case of growth of a lung tumor by the pleura parietalis, the resection is extended by taking the pleural parietalis (an extrapleural resection). In the event of growth by the thorax wall, the affected part of the thoral wall is included in the lung resection. There are indications that a separate resection (first extrapleular and then thorac wall) worsens the prognosis. The 5-year survival varies from 16 to 56% if the recession is complete and the lymph nodes are not affected. Level 3:C Ratto 1991, (36) Shah 1994, (38) Pitz 1996, (64) Downey 1999, (39) Elia 2001, (41) Magdeleinat Tumoren that grows through to the pericard and diaphragm, its resectable with an acceptable survival. (T3) or in different lobes (T4 on the same side, different M1a) and there is no pleuritis carcinomatosa (M1a), it is still possible to resection. Level 3: C Detterbeck 2001, (58) Battafarno 2002. (65) If a T4 status peroperative is established, based on growth in the aortic wall, the vena cava superior, the atrium, the intrapericardial area of the pulmonalis, the spine, the mediastinal, or up to the trachea, a complete resection can be performed in highly selected cases. The 5-year survival varies in those cases between 14 and 42%. Level 3 C Tsuchiya 1994, (53) Mathisen 1991, (51) Tsuchija 1990, (52) Roviaro 2001, (66) Dartevelle 1997, (54) The Meester 1989, (56) Detterbeck 2001, (67) Grunenwald 2002. (57) If T4-spiration is determined by the patient's growth rate, then Tsuchiya 1994 (53). Due to growth by the oesophagus is considered to be irresectable, but there is no literature supporting this. Level 3: C Detterbeck 2001. (58) Summary of literature T1-T2-tumors In an article, Ginsberg et al. described a prospectively randomised study on behalf of the Lung Cancer Study Group in 1995, comparing the results of a lobectomy with those of a smaller resection (1) in 247 patients with a T1N0 tumour. A lobecctomy was found to cause 75% less local relapses (6.4% versus 17.2%), and, moreover, died in the group with a lower resection, 50% more patients on the bronchocarcinoma. The 5 year survival was 44% in a small resection against 65% after a lobectomy. Although in 1996 by Rubenstein et already. corrections to this article were described 41% increase in the total number of patients who died and 47% in the number of cancers reduced respectively. Landreneau et al. published in 1997 a study comparing 102 patients with an open wigre section with 117 similar patients undergoing lobectomy (7). The 5-year survival of patients with open wigress section was 58%, of patients suffering from VATS wedge section 65% and of patients undergoing a lobecctomy 70%. Their results therefore confirmed the outcome of the study of the Lung Cancer Study Group (LCSG). In Japan, a number of studies were conducted in the 1990s in which tumours < 2 cm were treated with a segment resection (8) (9) (10). In one of the studies, high 5-year prevalence rates were found: 82% and 89%. In a recent survey, lung cancer-related survival was 91%. In the LCSG study, the progressive understanding of sublobary resection (11). However, anatomical segment resection appears to be a more appropriate procedure than a wigresection. Pending the outcome of ongoing studies (CALGB 140503, JCOG 0804 and JCOGA 0802), it is recommended that a considered multidisciplinary advice is given for each individual patient, referring to the above considerations. A more limited resection than a lobectomy may also be indicated in patients with a highly postoperative mortality or morbidity risk, usually based on limited lung function. The 5-year survival of T1-T2 tumors after a segment or wigressection in patients who have a compromised lung function ranges from 42 to 69% (2) (12) (13). There are no comparative studies comparing this patient population with deliberate curative radiotherapy. Tumor growth to another lobe, bronchostium or arteria pulmonalis if tumour tissue grows from one lobe to another or there is through growth at the height of the ostium of the bronchus or in the a pulmonalis. In a survey carried out in 1983, which examined by the Lung Cancer Study Group 2200 resections, mortality after pneumonectomy was 6.2% and after a lobectomy 2.9% (14). In a recent study involving 485 patients similar percentages were found (15). The postoperative mortality after a pneumonecctomy was 8% and following a lobectomy 2.4%. There was one small study known for the results of a pneumonictomy or a loboectomy with partial resection from the other lobe in the growth of a tumor from one lobe to another (16).1 In 19 patients no difference in 5-year survival was found. Also in growth central of the ostium of the bronchus and/or in the arteria pulmonalis there is an attempt to prevent pneumoneectomy. In these cases, it is investigated whether a seve' lobecctomy can be performed. 26) (27) (28) (29) (30). \"Sleeve\" resections appear to be more likely to give a local recurrence than a pneumonectomy, but the long-term results are better. In addition, the quality of life is better and its sleeve resection is also more cost-effective. Series show that 5-8% of the total number of interventions is eligible for a fluorophenylsleeves' lobectomy (31). If growth in the pulmonalis artery does not allow a simple lobeectomy, then a resection of this artery can be done, whether or not in combination with a decanoatesleve' resection from the bronchus (record double sleeve). Vogt-Moykopf et al. published the first large series with 37 angioplastic interventions (32). They reported a high postoperative mortality rate of 17% in a double sleeve. Later, good results were reported in small series (33). In fact, there is only one group that published much about it (35). In a series of 52 patients with a reconstruction of the pulmonary artery, no increased morbidity and mortality were found. The 5-year survival was 38.3% for the whole group. Table 1 'Sleeve' resection and pneumonectomy. The 5-year survival was 38.3% for the whole group. Table 1 'Sleeve' resection and pneumonectomy.

The numbers swum between 16% and 56% if the glands have not been affected (N0) and the resection has been complete (36) (37) (3 Controversial or tumor-tolerative spill' which occurs in a separate resection (longparenchym and thoracic wall is prognostic. Most authors stress that in doubt about extraplural enlargement the tumur should primarily be chosen for physique and block' taking along the acquired thorex wall (36), (39) (41) (42). The diaphragm defect is primarily closed or with the help of a marlex prosthesis (44) (45). Also a resection of a part of the pericardium is simple (46). Regrowth by the mediastinal is always considered prognostically poor, because the percentage of N2 attack is high (47). Evaluation in a recent study shows a prognosis similar to that of patients with tumors with thoraxwandinvasion (45) T4 tumors Prognosis of patients who have T4 tumours is poor and treatment should be performed in consultation with a center. A treatment has been taken from the Chest supplement of January 2003 (48). Experiences in a Dutch hospital confirm that careful selection is important because the postoperative hospital mortality (19.1%) is more recent literature on sequential chemotherapy shows that patients with a cT4N0M0 is shown to have a 2 year survival of 74%. Generally accepted is that the results in experienced hands are good, but at the same time that it is a major procedure. A carinare section is performed almost exclusively on the right side. On the left side the procedure can be performed in two tempi. Regrowth of the tumor in the large vessels does not always mean that the tumour is irresectable. In the (49) resection of the left atrium it is mostly about tumor enlargement along the v. pulmonalis. Resection of a v. cava superior is technically possible with a reasonable 5-year survival (53) (54). The vena cava can be simply clamped off and reconstruction takes place with a prosthesis or, if a lateral resection has been performed, with primary reconstruction. During clamping the arterial pressure should be maintained at level. When growth in the aortica consists of the majority of patients whose growth is limited to the adventitia. The growth of the tumor in the oesophagus is generally considered to be unsectable. There is no literature that supports this view. It is generally accepted that a pleuritis carcinomatosa is irresectable. More tumors in a lobe are included in the current 7th TNM classification among the T3 tumors. During the procedure it is often not possible to distinguish between multiple synchronous lung tumours and intrapulmonary metastases. In both cases, the prognosis after a complete resection with N0 status is reasonable to good and therefore apply, for the peroperative strategy, the principles as previously described for individual tumours (58). In the case of atelectase or pneumonia of the whole lung, it is necessary to assess whether a sleve' resection is possible in order to avoid pneumonectomy. In the case of atelectase or pneumonia of the entire lung, it is necessary to assess whether a feline sleeve resection is possible to avoid pneumonectomy.

The lung is also fully inspected and palpated in order to determine the T-status. The diagnosis NSCLC is preferably preoperative. If this is not possible, rapid diagnostics should be available during the operation by means of a freeze-coupe examination. The study preferably takes place on as limited a lung resection as possible (segment or wigexcision). In case of a central tumor a needle biopsy can be performed. If malignancy can then be established, extension of the lung recession occurs during the same procedure. Vriescoupe examination of the bronchus resection plane is important for the intraoperative determination of residual tumour tissue. Different use of terms may lead to differences in morphological interpretation. Therefore, it is recommended to use uniform terms for tumor localization in the bronchus resection area. Four locations are distinguished: A bronchial mucosal tumor is also indicated whether there is a carcinoma in situ, which can also spread within the basal membrane of seromukous glands. A microscopic tumor residue at the site of the bronchus resection plane results in statistically significantly less survival and statistically significantly greater chance of recurrence, both locally and remotely (3) (4) (10) (11) (12) (13). In one of the studies referred to, a positive bronchus surface was an independent prognostic factor (p=0.04) (14). In some studies, differences in rates of survival and recurrence were found that were not statistically significant, probably partly based on insufficient statistical data and incomplete data (6). The risk of complications of the anastomosis in bronchoplastic procedures is also statistically significantly higher in the presence of a positive bronchus cut (14). In most studies, it is recommended to perform intraoperative freeze coupe examination of the bronchus resection plane and to extend the resection in case of a negative Non-small cell lung cancer sneezing surface, so that a complete resection can be performed (4) (9) (10) (12) (15) (5). (R0: no tumour tissue left in the resurgent surfaces; R1: microscopic tumour tissue remaining; R2: macroscopic residual tumour tissue missing) However, if no freezer coupe study has been performed and there is evidence that residual tumour tissues are present at the site of the bronchus resection area, reoperation is recommended in patients at stage I and II (3) (12) (9) (9). A re-intentity gives an increased risk of mortality and complications (17). The sensitivity of freeze-coupe study 94% in a specific 90% (21).Several large series show that the percentage of false-positive results in freezer-coope study was less than 1 and the rate of error-negative results less than 2.5 (see Table 3) (21) (22) (23) (25) (26) (27) (28).The accuracy stated in a systematic review of 16 studies is about 95% (29), and it appears to be increased by simultaneous cytological examination in the form of dep- or scrape preparations (30) (33)).These figures are also applicable to freeze-cupe analysis of lymph nodes. In a recent study on the reliability of the freeze-choupe survey of the bronchresection surface, 1.5% were found to be error-positive and 1.9% false-negative findings (20). Clinical stading does not provide a completely reliable prediction of the presence of mediastinal lymph node metastases. The final status of the N1 and N2 lymphoid glands should therefore be determined on the basis of the enzymatic examination of the intrapulmonary,hilary and mediastinal lymph nodes removed during surgery. The probability of metastasis in a mediastinal lymph gland depends on the T-status, the monoclonal type of tumour, the location of the primary tumour and of the mediastinal lymph Node and also on the presence and location of metstatics in N1-lymph nodes (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34). Standard component of the Intraoperative evaluation of N status is the dissection of all N1 stations on which a tumour drains. The lymph nodes of station 12 (lobair) are included with the lobectomy preparation. The lymphatic glands of stations 11 (interlobary) and 10 (hilary) are usually separated. This implies that non-small cell lung cancer research during surgery should also be available for the determination of lymph nodes. Intraoperative evaluation of N status by mediastinal lymph node sampling' or dissection is also a standard part of the surgical treatment of NSCLC (35). The lack of standardisation and uniform terminology for feline sampling', systematic  terribly lymphatic lymph nod sampling' and complete mammal lymph nog dissection and in design curative mediastinal lymph gland dissection hinders comparison of research results. The different options related to intraoperative assessment of mediastinal lymph nodes and the definitions of these methods are presented in the table below. In the description and comparison of the literature, the definitions given in Table 4 are used and derived from the literature (36). Despite this variation of intraoperative options in the literature it is recommended to perform a systematic lymph noggy dissection. If no intraoperative evaluation is made of Enterostatic lymph nodes, the tumour metastas positive N2-lymphes are missed in approximately 10% of patients with NC, and are derived from their perceptology. A study of 95 patients undergoing pulmonary resection due to NSCLC, which compared the intraoperative visual and palpatory findings of 287 mediastinal lymph nodes with the enzymatic findings, showed that the sensitivity of inspection and pallation was 71% and the specificity 94%. In 9 of the 95 patients, the assessment of lymph node stations was error negative (39). In a retrospective comparative study, systematic mediastinal lymph nodular sampling' and complete mediastinal lymph Node dissection 2.7 times as much (95% CI: 1.2-6.3) N2 disease was diagnosed with baseline intraoperative findings (40) The absence of lymphatic node metastases in N1 stations does not imply that evaluation of the mediastinal lymph glands is unnecessary. In about 30% of patients with positive N2 glands are not metastasic in the N1 glands. In recent years, however, there has become more known about the location of sampling versus dissection of mediastinal lymph nodes.One of the baseline questions was focused on this and presented below. 3. Pleural lavage Several studies show that the outcome of the lavage of the pleural cavity prior to removal of lymph nodes and lung resection has predictive value for the prognosis of patients with NSCLC (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51). Two plausible explanations for tumour cells in the pleura cavity have been described: exfoliation of tumor cells in tumors with invasion of the pleuravisceralis (46), (47), (52), and lymphogenic spread of tumour cells (47). (49). After opening the thorax, 300 ml of physiological-salt solution lavage takes place during one minute, before manipulation of the lung occurs. A positive lavage is described as a result of this diagnostic procedure. However, survival is better than in patients with pleural effusion based on pleuritis carcinoma (50). The study of Hillerdal et al. found a difference in 3 year survival, which was not statistically significant: 64% in negative cytology rash Not small cell lung carcinoma versus 41% in positive (53). It is conceivable that the statistical phosphonate power' of this study was insufficient to show a significant difference. An overview of the studies is given in the annex (see Table 5) (46) (52) (48) (51) (50).

Recommendation Consider the application of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immune therapy in patients without specific aberrations of the tumor genome (see KNT list) with a resectable* stage II and III ** and PD-L1 TPS positive NSCLC. *Because there is no formal definition of what is a resectable NS CLC, the technical resectability of the lung oncological MDO should be assessed by experienced lung surgeons, in doubt one should consult a center with specific expertise in the patient's lung surgery complexity) ** (please note, the Checkmate 816 study has performed inclusions based on stadification according to the TNM 7th edition, the guideline module used in the current version of the 8th edition; this results in some tumours with a larger T-descriptor being given a higher stage). In patients with increased tumour PD-L1 expression, this is only compensated for in PD- L1 ≥50% and stage III without N2 involvement or stage III based on unforeseen N2. Adjuvant chemotherapy prior to adjuvant atezolizumab is mandatory for this indication. Consider pembrolizumab in patients regardless of tumour PD - L1 expression.* * If available as compensated care in the Netherlands) Considerations Advantages and disadvantages known from literature Neoadjuvanted immune therapy with chemotherapy The neoadjuvant use of immune therapy (nivolumab) with chemotherapy may result in longer overall survival, event-free survival and response, when compared to neoadjurant chemotherapy alone. There may be no (or hardly noticeable) clinically relevant difference in quality of life between groups. Neoadjivante chemoimmune therapy with adjuvant immunotherapy (peritive treatment) Neoadjovant immune treatment (pembrolizumab or nivolumab), in combination with chemother therapy, in total survival, and non-adjuval therapy alone therapy. Adjuvant immune therapy (pembrolizumab or atezolizumab) with or without prior chemotherapy may result in better disease-free survival than placebo/best supportive care with or excluding prior chemotherapy. For overall survival, it is uncertain whether there is a positive effect. Adjuvant immune therapy may give more side effects. The effect on quality of life is unknown. General considerations The expected benefits are greatest for the neoadjuvanting/perioperative use of immune therapy in combination with chemotherapy. Furthermore, the subgroups with a higher stage and positive PD-L1 TPS seem to have more advantage (see Professional perspective). The added toxicity is not negligible: the selection (autoimmune history, among others) and information of the patient on the risk of specific adverse reactions is essential in this. Evidence of the literature The working group concludes that the probative power of literature is very low. The inclusion criteria for patients with EGFR and ALK mutations were variable and there was no clear definition of what resectable stage III NSCLC means. The current studies all apply a form of platinum-doublet chemotherapy as a control-arm treatment for NSClC patients at all stages, from IB to IIIC. This is not necessarily in line with standard practice, where patients in the previous stages are first operated. For advanced stages, ranging from IIIA to IIIB, there is no consensus on the best control-poor treatment. In neoadjuvant chemoimmune therapy there is a real risk that patients will not undergo scheduled surgery due to side effects of treatment. Various studies show that a significant proportion of patients are ultimately not operated, often due to disease progression or treatment-related complications. A clinically very relevant demand is the role of adjuvant immune therapy after neoadjivantous chemotherapy and surgery. The present studies do not answer this question. Testing for EGFR and ALK mutations prior to surgery is becoming increasingly important for matching neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatments. In patients with an oncogenic driver the added value of immune therapy in the (neo)adjuvant setting has not been proven, on the contrary, it may complicate any subsequent treatment with a TKI. The ADAURA and ALINA studies show that these patients may benefit from adjuvanted targeted TKIs. Similarly, testing for PD-L1 for the operation is of great importance. The current studies have shown in the subgroup analyses that patients with PD- L1 negative tumors have very little benefit from adding immune therapy. Subgroup analyses also show that patients who have lower stages of NSCLC, such as stage I, have less benefit from the discussed treatment strategies. It was also shown that both the OS and EFS benefit for the entire study population were driven mainly by the PD-l1 positive subgroups. In line with these reasons, the use of neoad Juvante chemo-niumab (Checkmate) has also shown the use in the lower stages in NSCLEC for patients in the treatment strategies discussed. This resulted in an approval by the FDA for this specific patient group. However, the EMA has only approved the treatment of patients in stage II-III with a PD-L1 expression of at least 50%. Remarkably, the KEYNOTE-091 study showed that there was an advantage of adjuvant pembrolizumab for the entire study population, regardless of the stage and without specific selection based on PD- L1 expression. The FDA and EMA have granted an approval for this indication. Except for patients with negative PD-l1 expression, one should be reluctant to employ neoadjuvant or adjuvant immune therapy in patients with tumour DNA aberrations associated with reduced efficacy of immune therapy. Examples of this type of unfavorable tumour mutation are STK11 or KEAP1 mutations and low tumour progression (see also below). The Non-small cell lung carcinoma Clinically Necessary Targets (KNT) list provides an overview of targets with consequences for treatment. In October 2023, the ESMO Congress presented the update of some of the above mentioned studies but also interesting new studies. However, these data were not included in the current guidance recommendations since they were published after the formulation of the search question: CheckMate-77T, a randomised phase 3 study, compared the effectiveness of neoadjuvant Non- small cell lung cancer nivolumab + chemotherapy followed by resection and adjuvant nivol1/2001, with placebo + chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant placebo. Patients were randomised 1:1 to the nivolfuran or placebo arm. The primary endpoint of the study was EFS, with secondary endpoints pCR and major pathological response (MPR). The interim analysis showed a significantly improved EFS in the ni volumab group of 0.58 and placebo. The subgroup analysis of both the pCR and the EFS showed that the benefit for the entire study population was mainly seen in the PD-L1 positive subgroup. Despite the intensified treatment regimen, the surgical and treatment-related adverse reactions remained similar between the two groups (Cascone, 2023). Of the KEYNOTE-671 study, an update of the co-primary endpoint OS was presented with a median follow-up time of 36.6 months. The EFS also improved in the pembro arm, with a HR of 0.72 (95% CI 0.56-0.93; P = 0.00517) and a median OS not yet achieved compared to 52.4 months in the placebo arm. EFS was also improved within the pembro arm (HR 0.59 [95% CI 0.48-0.72]. The subgroup analysis of both the OS and the EFS showed that the benefit for the entire study population was mainly driven by the PD-L1 positive subgroups. Patient perspective From the patient perspective, there are no additional considerations on top of the analysis of the benefits and disadvantages and the professional perspective of the working group. Acceptance, feasibility, implementation Each patient with a potentially resectable non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) should be discussed during a multidisciplinary consultation (MDO). In this context, careful consideration of the risks and benefits of neoadjuvant chemoimmune therapy should be made to determine the most appropriate treatment strategy. If in doubt, a centre with specific expertise in the patient's lung surgery complexity should be consulted. Neoadjuvant chemo-immune therapy is recommended especially for patients in stage II and III. Specifically, this treatment can be strongly recommended for patients with positive PD- L1 expression (TPS >1%). Costs The cost-effectiveness study of Das (2023) evaluated atezolizumab versus best supportive care (according to American commercial payer perspective).Atezolituzumab provided 1.045 extra quality-adjusted life years (QALY) at an incremental cost of $48.956, which resulted in an incremental Not small cell lung cancer cost-efficiency ratio of $46.859/QALY. Das (2023) concluded that at a willingness threshold of $150,000/QAly and an incremental costs-effectiveness ratio of$46. 859/QALy atezolozumab is cost-effective compared to best supportive Care. At this time, no cost-benefit study was conducted within the Dutch health care system. The high cost of treatment should be weighed against the expected quality of survival gains.In 2024, an overview of cost estimates of new adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment based on the NSCLC incidence in the Netherlands (Houda, 2024). Underbuiling Background In the current situation, patients with an early stage of NSCOL, treated with an additional treatment is discussed in preferenced case. After resection, additional adjuvanted platinum-doublet chemotherapy is discussed with the patient at pathological stage IIA-IIIA (TNM 8). With the results of a number of studies using neo-adjuvant, adjuvant and perioperative immune therapy, more treatment options will become available within the early stage NSCLC in the near future. This makes a guideline module on this subject desirable for the Dutch situation.

Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy plus adjuvant immunotherapy (perioperative treatment) Description of studies The double-blind KEYNOTE-671 trial (Wakeelee 2023) included patients with resectable stage II, IIIA or IIIB (N2 internship) NSCLC (8th TNM classification). A total of 797 patients were randomized to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg) (4 cycles) (n=397) with cisplatin-based chemotherapy or placebo with cisplatin-based chemistry (n=400), followed by surgical resection and adjuvant pembrozumab therapy (200 mg). (n =397) with cisflatin-based chemotherapy and placebo. The primary endpoints were event-free survival and overall survival. The NADIM-II trial (Provencio 2023) is an open-label RCT conducted at 21 hospitals in Spain. Patients with previously untreatable resistance stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC (8th TNM classification) and no known EGFR/ALK alters were considered eligible. A total of 86 patients were randomized to receive nivolumab (360 mg) plus platinum-based chemotherapy (3 cycles) (n=57) or chemotherapy alone (n=29), followed by surgery. The primary endpoint was a pathological complete response. Table 5.

(Felip, 2021; Felip, 2023) was an open-label, global trial conducted in Australia, Europe, Canada, Asia, Russian Federation, and the United States. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival. The IMpower010 results presented at the ASCO 2023 were not systematically worked out, as the peerreviewed article was not published yet at the moment of writing this module (October 2023). The PEARLS / KEYNOTE-091 trial (O.J.Brien 2022) was a triple-blinded (patients, healthcare professionals, outcome assistants) RCT and conducted among centers in Australia, Europe, Canada, Asia, Russian Federation, and the United States. A total of 1177 patients with completely regulated stage IB-IIIA NSCLC (7th TNM classification) was randomized to receive adjuvant pembrolizumab (up to 18 cycles) (n=587). Adjuvant chemotherapy was not recommended. They had no role in data collection. No other plausible sources of a risk of bias were encountered. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival. Both trials reported on overall survival, disease- free survival and adverse events, but not on quality of life (Table 6). Table 6. Both trials reported on overall survival, disease-free survival and adverse events, but not on quality of life (Table 6). Table 6.

The interim analysis of Felip (2021) showed that overall survival between groups was similar with 97/507 (19%) deaths in the adjuvant atezolizumab group and 90/498 (18%) deaths in the best supportive care group (HR: 1.07, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.42) (Felip 2021). The interim assessment of Fe Lip (2023) also showed a similar overall survival among groups with 127/507 (25%) deaths in an adjuvant atesolizumab Group and 124/498 (24.9%) death in the most supportive care Group (HR): 0.995, 95% C: 0.78 to 1.28) (Felipop Also in the PEARL / KEYNONOTE trial (as) was overt. trial medium overall survival (and 95% CI) was not reached in either group and an HR 0.87 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.15) was reported (O.J.Brien 2022). Disease-free survival Both trials showed a better disease-free surveillance in the adjuvant immunotherapy group compared to control, although this difference might not be clinically relevant (HR>0.6). The IMpower010 trial showed less disease recurrence in the adjunct atezolizumab group (187/507, 37%) compared to the best supportive care group (212/498, 43%) (HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.77 to 0.99) (Felip 2021). group compared to 42.0 months (95% CI 31.3 to not reached) (HR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.91) (O.J.Brien 2022). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events Among patients treated with adjuvant atezolizumab, 22% (108/495) experienced grade 3 or four adverse events compared to 12% (57/495) in the best supportive care group (Felip 2021). The atezolizumab-related adverse event events remained unchanged in the analysis by Felip 2023. The medium follow-up duration of ~32 months was ineffective to report the incidence of chronic immune adverse events (see also the comment by Remon 2022). Adverse events led to treatment interruption in 115 (20%) patients in the immunotherapy group. Immune-mediated adverse events and infusion reactions occured in 226 (39%) of 580 patients in a pembrolizumab group, with 84 (37%) of them requiring steroids (see also the comment by Gangulu 2022). Quality of life No data on quality of life was reported in either of the studies. Level of evidence of the literature The level of evidence for all outcomes started at  same level, as the included studies were RCTs. The level Of evidence regarding the outcome was overall survival was downgraded by three levels because of incidence data, wide confidence intervals that included both a clinically relevant difference and relevance. The level of evidence regarding the outcome of disease-free survival was downgraded by two levels because of wide confidence intervals that include both a clinically relevant difference and no clinically relevant difference (serious imprecision, one level) and potential publication bias (one level). The level of evidence could not be graded for the outcome quality of life, as it was not reported in the included studies. Search and select A systematic review of the literature was performed to answer the following question: What are the effects of neoadjuvant or adjuvant immunotherapy in patients with early-stage (I to IIIA) pathologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)? P: patients with premature-stage I to III A) pathologically confirmed NSCLC; I: neoadjurant or adjuvant (or both) immunotherapy with or without other treatment; C: neoadaptive treatment other than immunotherapy or another immunotherapy regime; O: overall survival, disease-free survival, even efficacy (or Both) immunotreatment with or Without other treatment. regime ; O: overall survival, disease-free survival, event-free surveillance, response rate (MPR/pCR), adverse events, quality of life. Relevant outcome measures The guideline development group considered overall survival as a critical outcome measure for decision making, whereas disease/event-free Survival, response rates, adverse events and quality of Life were considered as important outcome measures for decisionmaking. A priori, the working group did not define the outcomes listed above but used the definitions used in the studies. The working group defined the following minimal clinically (patient) important differences. For these definitions, the PASKWIL criteria for adjuvant treatment were used where possible, since there are no specific criteria for neoadjuvant therapy): Overall survival: >5% difference between the groups or >3% difference and HR <0.7, at least three years of medium follow-up time Disease-free survival: HR <0.6 Event-free surveillance: not described by PASKWIL) Response rate (for neoadjurant treatment): major pathological response (MPR), pathological complete response (pCR) Adverse events: absolute difference <5% for valid quality of life instruments Search and select (Methods) The systematic review published by Wang (2022) was used to retrieve relevant RCTs. Wang searched PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase with relevant search terms until November 2021. The detailed search strategy is detailed in the supplemental methods (Wang, 2022). Four of the 52 included studies were considered eligible (NEOSTAR, CheckMate 816, IMpower010, PEARLS/KEYNOTE-091). On the 24th of February 2023, we performed a systematic search for systemic reviews and RCT's about early non-small cell cancer and immunotherapy in the databases Embase.com and Ovid/Medline. The search resulting in 223 unique hits and we screened publications published the search of Wang (2022). The search results in 104 unique extra hits. This search yielded five additional RCTs (KEYNOTE-671, NADIM-II, TD-FOREKNOW, NeoCOAST, NCT03110978). An overview of all excluded and ongoing trials was added as a supplement. Results published in abstracts are described in the considerations, waiting peer-reviewed publication. One publication was added to the body of evidence (Felip 2022), because it was considered to be a unique contribution for assessing the effect of neoadjuvant immunotherapy. This conference abstract described No small cell lung cancer quality of life data of the CheckMate 816 trial not mentioned elsewhere. Important study characteristics and results of all studies are listed in the evidence tables. The assessment of the risk of bias is summerized in the risks of bias tables. Not all described treatments were available in the Netherlands for patients with early-stage (stage I to III) NSCLC at the time of developing this guideline module (October 2023). The analysis of outcomes below is restricted to the studies with relevant available treatments (CHECKMATE-816, KEYNOTE-671, NADIM-II, PEARLS / KEYNOTE-091 and IMpower010).

Recommendation Consider treatment with osimertinib in patients with an Ex19del or L858R mutation in EGFR at a stage IB-IIIA (TNM 8) after curative resection possibly after adjuvanted chemotherapy (compliant module OsimertinibAdjuvant chemotherapy at stage IA-III A). This is regardless of age. Discuss with the patient concerned the benefits, disadvantages and risks of both osimertinib and chemotherapy. Considerations Advantages known from the literature At this time, for the Dutch situation, only treatment with Osimirtinib is relevant for NSCLC patients with stage IB -IIIA and an EGFR mutation (ex19del of L858,R) after full adjuvant chemotherapy is considered. After 24 months, 89% of patients were alive and disease-free in the osimertinib group, while this was 52% in the placebo group (Wu, 2022). Based on the study of Majem (2022), we conclude that there may be no or hardly any clinically relevant difference in quality of life between the groups. What is not studied directly in the PICO but is relevant for the patient group to be treated, is to what extent it is advisable to give chemotherapy prior to osimertinib. In this study there is no significant difference between the event-free survival (EFS) with and without adjuvant chemotherapy. This could be a reason not to give any chemotherapy at stage IA-IIIA. On the other hand, a survival benefit is seen from 87 versus 80% after 5 years. However, this does not allow for differences in stages of disease. Some patients may have to deal with paronychia, diarrhea, dry skin, pruritus. Part of the patients (about 10%) will not be able to follow the complete 3 years of treatment due to side effects. Evidence of the literature The working group concludes that the evidence for the effect of adjuvant treatment in the Netherlands for patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma after complete resection with a (TKI sensitive) gene change is still low, mainly because of the combination of some methodological Non-small Cell lung carcinoma limitations in the ADAURA study, imprecision (for example, the outcome measures total survival and toxicity) and indirectness (no evidence for other medicines available in the UK and/or other gene changes). Professional perspective From the survival data, it is also shown that patients treated with osimertinib had a survival benefit compared to placebo.Although osimimentinib could also be given in the event of disease progression, it appears that after an early survival benefit. Patient perspective From the patient perspective, there are no additional considerations on top of the analysis of the benefits and disadvantages and the professional perspective of the working group. Acceptance, feasibility, implementation The working group considers osimertinib as an acceptable intervention for all those involved that can be implemented. Osimertini can be given within the regular care. However, standard testing should be carried out on EGFR in the adjuvant setting. This may not be done everywhere. The guideline module on this subject is developed mid-2024, because the working party expects that there will be more known about other relevant tests in the adjunct setting. Costs Zhou (2022) investigated the cost effectiveness of osimertinib as adjunctive treatment for NSCLC patients with stage IB-IIIA and an EGFR mutation. This study showed that patients in the osimirtinib group 1.46 more Quality-adjusted Life Years (8.45 QALY compared to 6,99 QALy) compared to the placebo group with a lower in incremental cost ($ 39962,99). At this time, no cost-effectiveness study has been conducted within the Dutch healthcare system. The high cost of treatment should be weighed against the expected quality of survival gain. The Zorginstituut (ZIN) published the Package Advice for ADAURA. The Package Advice of ZorgInstituut Nederland (link to advice) investigated the cost-efficiency of adjuvant treatment with osimertinib after complete tumour resection in adults with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer with tumours with EGFR mutations in the Netherlands. Zorg Instituut Netherlands concluded that adjunctive treatment with Osimertinib is cost-effective compared to active follow; the incremental cost- effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 14,884 euro per QALY compared to the relevant reference value of 50,000 euro per qALY. Underbuilding Background In patients who have undergone a full resection of a non-minor lung cancer (stage I-III) is discussed in the MDOS. It is important to note that the studies are generally conducted under 5th-7th edition of TNM. The advice will be based on the 8th edition (IB to IIIA) pathological confirmed EGFR+ NSCLC * Currently, osimertinib is the only available treatment in the Netherlands within the adjuvant setting for patients with a completely adjusted, early-stage (I to III) pathologic confirmed NSCLEC harbouring a common EGFR-mutation Osimirtinib may increase 5-year overall survival (85%) when compared to placebo (73%). Source: (Wu, 2020; Herbst, 2023) QoL may not be substantially different with adjuvant osimertinib when compared to placebo. Low GRADE Sources: (Majem, 2022) The evidence suggestions that osimertinib results in more patients (9 more per 100 treated patients) with adverse events grade 3 or higher when matched to placebo. Low GRADE Sources (Wh, 2020); Herbst; 2023) Other adjuvant treatment No evidence is available regarding the effect of other adjuvant treatments available in the Netherlands or treatments for other associates or fusions. or adjuvant icotinib versus observation Non small cell lung carcinoma in patients with EGFR proportional positive absorbed stage IB NSCLC (7th TNM classification).

Results Osimertinib for EGFR+ NSCLC Currently, osimertLib is the only available treatment in the Netherlands within the adjuvant setting for patients with a completely resected, early-stage (I to III) pathological confirmed NS CLC harbouring a common EGFR mutation. Therefore, the analysis of outcomes below is restricted to osimirtinib. Overall survival Results from the ADAURA trial were married at the time of the analysis of Wu 2022 and could the reference not be considered in their system. with stage II to IIIA disease was 59.9 months (range: 0 to 82) in the osimertinib group and 56.2 months ( range 1 to 86) in The placebo group. The 5-year overall survival was 85% (95% CI: 79% to 89%) in theosimertinib group, and 73% (95%CI: 66 to 78), in the placebo group (HR 0.49; 95.03% CI: 0.33 to 0.73). In the osimerttinib treated group there was no significant OS difference between those who received adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.16 (95%CI 0.10.26) and those who did not (HR 0.23 (95%CI0.13-0.40)). HR-QOL was measured using the Short Form-36 (SF-36). Baseline physical/mental component summary (PCS/MCS) scores were comparable between osimertinib and placebo (range: 46-47) and maintained to week 96, with no clinically meanful differences between arms; difference in adjusted least squares (LS) mean -1.18 (95% CI - 2.02 to -0.34) and -1.34 (95% CI-2.40 to -0.28), for PCS and MCS, respectfully. No differences exceeding 10 points were reported for any of the scales. to disease recurrence (determined by computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, pathological disease on biopsy, or both) or death from any cause. In the primary analysis, the median disease-free survival was not achieved in the osimertinib group (95% CI 38.8 to could not be calculated) and 19.6 months (95% CI 16.6 to 24.5) in the placebo group. In The osimertinib group 37/339 (11%) patients had disease remission or died, compared with 159/343 (46%) patients in the placebo group. The percentage of patients who were alive and Not small cell lung cancer disease free at 24 months was 89% (95% CI 85% to 92%) in The osimartinib Group, compared to 52% (95% CI 46% to 92%). The median DFS was 65.8 months (95% CI 61.7 to could not be calculated) in the osimertinib group and 28.1 months (95%CI 22.1 to 35.0) in the placebo group. In the osimertinib group 94/339 (28%) patients had disease response or died, compared with 211/343 (62%) patients in the placebo group. The percentage of patients who were alive and disease free at 48 months was 73% (95% CI 67% to 78%) in the Osimertini group, compared to 38% (95% CI 32% to HR was 0.27 to 0.34. Toxicity Wu (2020) reported the outcome adverse events grade 3 or higher and serious adverse events. In the primary analysis, 68/339 (20%) (95% CI 16% to 24%) patients in the osimertinib group reported adverse events of grade ≥3, compared with 46/343 (13%) (95% CI 10% to 17%) patients at the placebo group (RR 1.50; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.11). This result indications that among patients who received osimertinib an additional 7 (95% CI 1 to 12) patients per 100 treated patients experienced adverse eventsgrade 3 or above. Serious adverse events were reported in 54/339 patients (166%) (95% CI, 12% to 20%) in the Osimertini group and in 42/343 patients (12%). 23) patients reported adverse events of grade ≥3, compared with 48/343 (14%) patients in the placebo group (RR 1.68; 95% CI 1.21 to 2.32). The most common were diarrhea (n = 9, 3%), stomatitis (n= 6, 2%), pneumonia (n=1, 1%) and QTc prolongation (n=0, 1%), in the osimertinib group, which were also reported in one (<1%), zero, four (1%), and one (< 1%) patient in the placebo group (John, 2023). Among patients who receive osimartinib an additional 9 (95% CI 1 to 12) patients per 100 treated patients experienced adverse events grade 3 or higher. of evidence of the literature The evidence was derived from an RCT, therefore the level of evidence for all outcomes started at  same level. The level of experience regarding the outcome overall survival was downgraded by two levels because of serious study limitations (-1 level for risk of bias, because of incomplete information about random Not small cell lung cancer generation and allocation concealment and loss to follow-up) and imprecision (confidence interval crossing the boundary of clinical decision making, i.e. HR 0.7). The level of evidence regarding the outcome of measurement disease-free survival was downgraded by two levels because of serious study limitations (-1 level for risk of bias, because of incomplete information about random sequence generation and allocation concealment and loss to follow-up) and impact (few events, optimal information size not met). Therefore, the level of evidence was graded as low. Search and select Search and choose A systematic review of the literature was formulated to answer the following question: Following a complete resistance, which adjuvant treatment should be given to patients with early-stage (stage I-III) lung cancer with a targetable gene alteration? P: patients with complete resected, early-state (I to III) pathologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a targeted gene alterance; I: adjuvant treatment specific for EGFR, ALK, RET, ROS1, BRAF, WITH alterations; C: chemotherapy or placebo; O: overall survival, disease-free survival, response rate, adverse events, quality of life. as critical outcome measures for decision making. A priori, the working group did not define the outcome measures listed above but used the definitions used in the studies. The working group defined the following minimal clinically (patient) important differences (using the PASKWIL criteria 2023 for adjuvant treatment where possible): • Overall survival (OS): >5% difference between the groups or >3% difference and HR <0.7, at least three years of medium follow-up time • Disease-free survival (DFS): HR <0.6 • Quality of life (QoL): A minimally important difference of 10 points on quality-quality-quality - equivalent to any other instrument. on other quality of life instruments. • Toxicity (adverse events grade ≥3): statistically significant difference between the groups. Search and select (Methods) The systematic review published by Zhao (2022) was used as the basis for this literature summary. This systematic review included patients with completely adjusted, early-stage (stage I to III) pathological confirmed NSCLC; Phase 2/3 RCTs comparing adjuvant EGFR-TKIs with chemotherapy or placebo; primary endpoints such as OS or DSF were reported; safety and adverse events (AEs) or chemotherapy were evaluated in these trials. The systematic literature search performed by Zhao (2022) resulted in 3483 hits. Based on title and abstract screening, 32 studies were initially selected. After reading the full text and through assessment of the studies, 23 studies were excluded (no RCTs, no outcome of interest and inefficient information after reviewing the full Text), and nine RCT's were included (Tada, 2021; He, 2021, Wu, 2020; Zhong, 2018, 2021; Yue, 2018; Kelly, 2015; Feng, 2015: Li, 2013; Gosss, 2013). An overview of all the included RCTS in the systemic review can be found in table 1. On the 27th of January 2023, we performed a systematic search for systemic reviews and RCT about NSCLC and complement therapy for patients with EGK, ALK, BROX and subsequent database. From this yield a recent publication of quality of life data from the ADAURA trial was found (Majem, 2022). No studies were found for other variants. On the 5th of June 2023, we performed an update of the systematic search for RCTs in the same databases. The search resulted in 28 additional unique hits. From this achieved recent publications of OS, DFS and safety/QoL data from The ADAURE trial were found (Herbst, 2023; Tsuboi, 2024; John, 2023). Moreover, one additional RCT was included (Ou, 2023) In this updated search, no studies were founded for other associates. Results A total of studies were included in the analysis of the literature for EGFR+ NSCLC in addition setting. The study was included in Gos (2013) was not included in this study. Furthermore, not all described treatments were available in the Netherlands at the moment of developing this guideline module. The assessment of the risk of bias is summerized in the risks of bias tables. The important study characteristics and results are summerized into the evidence tables.

J Thorac Oncol. 2023 May Initial question What is the site of adjuvanted immune therapy after chemoradiotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma stage III? Recommendation Treat the following patients with durvalumab preferably within 6 weeks of completion of competing chemoradiotherapy for 12 months: with stage III irresectable non-fine cell lung cancer regardless of PD-L1 status and; who are in good condition (WHO performance status 0 to 1 after completion of chemorradiotherapy) and; do not show disease progression upon completion of competitor chemo-radiotherapy on a CT with intravenous contamination of the thorax and upper abdomen and; there was no contra-indication for immunotherapy. Treat patients with Stage III non-minor lung cancer with tecemotide after competitor chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled PACIFIC study, survival was improved by durvalumab.After 2 years, 66.3% of patients in thedurvalumab group were still alive compared to 55.6 % in the placebo group. This is an absolute difference of 10.7% with a hazard ratio of 0.68 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.85). The PACIFIC study included patients with each PD-L1 expression as well as with an unknown PD- L1 status. No clinically relevant differences in adverse reactions between durvallumab and placebo were found. The START study found no clinically relevant difference in median survival between tecemotide and control (i.e. median survival 25.8 and 22.4 months), with a HR for death of 0.89 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.03).The START trial was prematurely interrupted due to the occurrence of tempalitis in another study in multiple myeloma patients. Durvalumab did not appear to have a negative effect on QoL compared to placebo. These results were not yet published at the time of writing of this directive. Evidence is on average for outcome measures of survival, progression-free survival, response rate and safety (adverse effects and toxicity) for the comparison durvalumab versus placebo after competing chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This means that it is likely that durvallumab after competitor chemotherapy, radiotherapy results in increased survival, progressive survival and response rate (follow-up 2 years), while the adverse reactions were comparable. The probative force is low for outcome survival for the tecemotide versus placebo comparison after competing Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy and very low for the outcome side effects.This means that new studies may show different effects. Values and preferences of patients (and possibly their caregivers) Treatment with adjuvant immunotherapy can take place in centres that meet the criteria for pallitive immunotherapy, resulting in optimal results for survival, side effects and quality. The average incremental cost per patient is €145.932 for durvalumab and €72.393 for active tracking.The average incremental costs per patient are €73.539 compared to the cost of active tracking .Quality of life The effects of the treatments are expressed in terms of quality of life-adjusted years of life (QALY) and life-years gained (LYG).Durvalumab results in 5.05 QALY per patient and 2.99 QAL Y in active monitoring .The overall average health gain is therefore 2.06 QALy per patient compared to active monitoring. Due to the use of durvallumab, the average number of LYG 6.12 is insufficient; in active tracking this is 3.65 . The incremental effect for LY G is therefore 2,47. Durvalumab is therefore cost-effective. Admissibility for the other relevant stakeholders There is insufficient knowledge of the outcomes of patients treated with sequential radiotherapy , or with a performance score of 2. In the PACIFIC study, a CT scan of the thorax and upper abdomen was required after competing chemotherapy and radiotherapy to rule out disease progression. Because durvalumab should start within 6 weeks of the last radiotherapy, it is desirable to schedule the CT scan within 3 weeks and by preference as soon as possible after the end of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy often causes multiple changes in the lungs and tumor and/or irradiated glands that are difficult to interpret. Therefore, abnormalities in the chest have been proven to be post-radiotherapy findings. Additional studies are only rarely necessary. The CT scans of thorac and upper abdominal are performed with intravenous contrast, unless there are contra-indications. This CT scan is an additional study that needs to be carried out and where sufficient capacity on the radiology department is required. In preclinical studies were found to work with radiotherapy the best if both are given together or if the PD-(L) 1 inhibitor is given as quickly as possible. That patients who receiveddurvalumab within 2 weeks of the end of radiation therapy had a better survival than when durvalumab was administered later is not evidence, but has a biological rational. Supportive therapy during and after the competitor chemotherapy and radiotherapy should be optimally done, thus maximizing the likelihood that patients will be in good general condition (WHO performance status 0-1), so that they can get durvallumab. Recommendation 1 Rationale/ balance between the arguments for and against the intervention of 12 months of durvlumab within 6 weeks of competing chemotherapy, and radiotreatment in patients in good condition (WTO performance status 0-1) and without disease progression with a stage III NSCLC (regardless of PD-L1 status) probably results in a clinically relevant gain in survival, progression-free survival and a good response rate (follow-up 2 years), while the group considers that this treatment to be recommended. Recommendation 2 Radal/ balance of the arguments before and against intervention Due to the lack of evidence of a high level of the study due to a higher level of efficacy and to the subsequent treatment of another treatment is not considered to be consistent with clinical efficacy. For most patients in good general condition and with good organ function, competitive chemotherapy and radiotherapy is the first choice (Postmus, 2017).Because the best 5-year survival in the best ranges is only about 35%, there is a lot of interest in treatments that can improve the prognosis. Preclinically, there are strong arguments for synergy or additive effect between immunotherapy and radiation therapy (Formenti, 2018; Ngwa, 2018). Therefore, it is logical to combine competing chemoradiotherapy with immunotherapy in patients with stage III NSCLC. Conclusions Adjuvant durvalumab versus placebo Adjuvant duvalumab after competitor chemotherapy therapy results in a higherchance of Moderate overall survival compared to placebo in patients in stage III non-small cell cancer GRADE Sources: (Antonia, 2018) Adjuvalumab following competitor chemoradiotherapy results in an increased survival free survival compared with non-stage.

GRADE Sources: (Butts, 2014; Mitchells, 2015) Cause of a slack of data, it was not possible to compare progress free survival, response rate and quality of life of adjuvant tecemotide with placebo in diseases with GRADE advanced non-arrow cell lung Cancer. We are uncertain about the safety (adverse events and toxicity) or adjuvant tecemotide Very low after chemoradiotherapy in patients With advanced non‐small cell cancer. Both studies included patients of multiple hospitals across different countries. Two articles (Antonia, 2017; Antonia, 2018) reported outcomes at different follow-up moments of the PACIFIC study. Outcomes of 476 patients receivingdurvalumab were compared with 237 patients receiving placebo. Included patients had received at least two cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy competitorly with defining radiation therapy. The overall medium follow- up was 25.2 months (Antonia, 2018). Including patients had received at least two cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy (given sequentially or competitorly) with radiation. At the time of the clinical holding, 1182 of the planned 1322 patients were randomly assigned. A modified intention-to-treat population was designed for the primary analysis by prospectively excluding patients randomly assigned within the 6 months preceding the clinical hold. This approach was based on the assessment that a minimum of eight weekly doses and two 6-weekly doses (correcting to about 6 months of treatment) were needed for tecemotide to induce an immunotherapeutic effect on survival. As a result, the sample size was adjusted and 274 excluded patients were replaced. Both studies were designed and fulfilled by the pharmaceutical industry and represented of the funders See table 1 and evidence tables for details of the studies. Results Durvalumab versus placebo 1. Overall survival (critical outcome) The PACIFIC study (Antonia, 2017; Antonia, 2018) compared 476 patients receiving darvalumab with 237 patients receiving placebo. The overall survival (OS) at 24 months was 66.3% (95% CI 61.7 to 70.4) in thedurvalumab group and 55.6% (95% CI 48.9 to 61.8) in the placebo group (two-sided P=0.005). The hazard ratio for death was 0.68 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.85 favoring durationumab. the 187 (39.6%) died in thedurvalumab group versus 41 of the 105 (39%) in the placebo group (HR for death 0.92 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.34)). The hazard ratio for disease progression or death was 0.51 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.63) favoringdurvalumab. PD-L1 subgroups The progression-free survival benefit with durvalumab was observed irrespective of PD- L1 expression before chemoradiotherapy (HR 0.59 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.82) for a PD-l1 expression level of < 25% and 0.41) (95% CI 0.26 to 0.65) for a pc-L2 expression level or ≥ 25%) at the time of the first data cut-off point with a median follow-up of 14.5 months. 3. Response rate Patients receiving durationumab had a higher clinical response compared to patients receiving placebo in the PACIFIC study. The objective response was 30.0% (95% CI 25.8 to 34.5) in the durability group versus 17.8%. not reached in thedurvalumab group at a median follow-up time of 25.2 months and 18.4 months (95% CI 6.7 to 24.5) in the placebo group. 4. Quality of life The PACIFIC-study did not publish data on the quality of life yet. 5. Safety (adverse events and toxicity) Adverse events of any cause and grade occured in 460 (96.8%) patients in the durationumab group versus 222 (94.9%) in the placebo group (RR1.02 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.06)). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events of each occasion occured at 145 (30.5%) patients in this durationumab Group versus 61 (26.1%) in the placement group (rr 1.17 (95% CI 0.11 to 1.51)). Grade 5 adverse events of every occasion (4 Treatment related adverse events were only reported at the first data cut-off point with a median follow-up of 14.5 months. Treatment related adverse events of any grade occured in 322 (67.8%) patients in thedurvalumab group versus 125 (53.4%) in the placebo group (RR 1.27 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.45)). Treatment related grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 56 (11.8%) patient in the duvalumab Group versus 10 (4.4% in the placebo group (TR 2.76 (95% CI 1.43 to 5.31)). Level of evidence compared to placebo There are four levels of evidence: high, moderate, low, and very low. RCTs start at a high level of evidence. The level of quality of evidence for the outpatient and overfall was overflow from 1 to level. survival and toxicity was downgraded with 1 level from high to moderate because of imprecision of results (total number of patients < 2000 per group). The level of quality of evidence for the outcome of progress free survival and response rate was downgraded with 1 degree to moderate because of impact of outcomes (total figure of patients less 2000 per Group). As the included study did not report data on the quality of life, it was possible to assess the level of evidence. Tecemotide versus placebo 1. Overall survival (critical outcome) The START study (Butts, 2014; Mitchells, 2014) compares patient recovery tecemamido were compared with 507 patients receiving placebo. The hazard ratio for death was 0.89 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.03). Subgroup analyses A pre-specified subgroup analysis showed different hazard ratios between competitor chemoradiotherapy versus placebo (HR 0.81 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.98)) (median OS 30.8 versus 20.6 months) and sequential chemotherapy vs placebo (hr 1.04 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.31), p=0.38) (medial OS 19.4 versus 24.6 months).",

Safety (adverse events and toxicity) In March, 2010, clinical trials of tecemotide, including the START-trial, were put on hold for growth and treatment after a case of encephalitis occured in a phase 2 trial of tecemotide for multiple myeloma. Secondary investigations of this patient, an overall safety analysis of the use of teciemotide in non-small-cell cancer and introduction of safety measures by protocol among led to the clinical holding being lifted in June, 2010. Adverse events of any cause and graded in 938. (91.6%) patients in the teceMotide group versus 432. (90.6%) in the placebo group (RR) (RR 0.93 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.08)) Treatment related adverse events of any grade occurred in 353 (34%) patients in the tecemotide group versus 129 (27%) in the placebo group (RR 1.27 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.51)).

References Initial question What is the site of immunotherapy or a combination of immuno therapy and chemotherapy in the first line (primary treatment) of patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. Recommendation The following recommendations apply to patients with non-curative treatment NSClC, performance score 0-1, no contra-indications for immunotherapy and without molecular abbreviation for which a targeted therapy is available (see module  accomplished) Treatment metastatic NSCLEC with rare mutation . Treat patients with PD-L1 ≥50% primary with pembrolizumab monotherapy independent of monoclonal subtype. and a PD-L1 <50% preferably primarily with platinumumpemetrexed pembrolizumab or carboplatin-paclitaxel-bevacizumab-atezolizumab. Plaveisel cell carcinoma Consider, in the subgroup of patients with squamous cell NSCLC with PD- L1 ≥50% treatment with carboplatinpaclitaxel-pembroli002. In all above cases, consider patients with Squamous Cell Carcinoma with PD L1 <500% preferably with carboplatinpaclitec-pebbroli1/2006. In the patient's case, consider whether there is actual treatment wish and also consider the possibility of non-tumour-oriented treatment. Consider chemotherapy treatment in patients with ECOG performance score of 2 or contra-indications for immunotherapy. Pros and cons of the intervention and quality of evidence The preferential treatment of metastatic NSCLC as first line treatment is determined by the combination of both patient characteristics and tumour characteristics. If patient has a good Non-small cell lung carcinoma performance status (ECOG PS ≤1), asymptomatic or treated stable brain metastases for which no dexamethasone with a dose equivalent of >10mg prednisone, no predictive mutation in EGFR, ALK, BRAF ROS1, and no other hard contra-indications for immunotherapy should be considered immunotherapy as monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy as an option for first line therapy. In addition, there are a number of mutations and gene fusions/rearrangements such as BRAF-V600E, ROS1 and RET for which highly effective TKI things are available and where the effect of immunotherapy is less well investigated. In such a centre of expertise there should be discussed about the treatment of first preference and if necessary reference. However, in the case of a PD-L1 TPS ≥50%, independent of histology, a clinically relevant survival benefit of pembrolizumab monotherapy treatment compared to chemotherapy alone has been demonstrated. In addition, the non-squamous cell carcinomas showed an advantage in terms of progression free survival for some combinations of chemotherapy with immunotherapy alone versus chemotherapy, in this case platinum-pemetrexed-pembrolituzumab versus platinum-pembrelizumab versus flatinumpemetrexed placebo and for carboplatin-paclitaxel-bevacizumab-atezolizumab  vs carboplatin -paclizumab-bvacizumab-placebo. There is also likely an advantage with overall survival for these combination of chemotherapy with chemotherapy only, but these data are not yet mature at the time of development of the directive and the evidence is low. However, after the search, the results of the keynote 407 study (Paz-Ares, 2018) were published. In this study, chemotherapy (carboplatin + paclitax cell or nab-paclitaxel) was compared with placebo compared to the same chemotherapy with pembrolizumab. A clinically relevant benefit was seen in relation to overall survival for the pembrilizumab combination group (HR for death 0.64; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85). This is particularly true for subgroups with PD-L1 TPS <1% and 1-49%. For the subgroup with PD -L1TPS ≥50%, the benefit for overall survival is not significant. For progression free survival, a clinically relevant advantage was seen for all PD- L1 subgroups in the group treated with the pembrozumab combination (HR of progression or death 0.56; 95% CI 0,45 to 0.70). However, in case of a non-plaveise cell NSCLC treatment with a combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapy in Non-small cell lung carcinoma is the preferred principle provided that the conditions mentioned in the first paragraph are met. For this, the combination of carbo- or cisplatinum with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab or the combination carboplatin, paclizumab, bevacizumab and atezolizumab are available. It is difficult to state which of these combinations is most effective since there is no head-to-head comparison. If there is a PD-L1 TPS from 1 to 49% at a squaveiscellig NS CLC there was at the time of cutting down from the literature search for this directive no evidence of any significant added value of immunotherapy as well as the standard treatment has been published with the above. However, the working group considers that treatment with carboplatin plus paclitaxel combined with pembrolizumab should be the preferred treatment for this group of patients with a squamous cell NSCLC. Even if there is a PD-L1 TPS <1%, tumour histology is important. For the non-palveisel cell NsCLC, the Keynote-189 study (Ghandi, 2018) did not show a significant benefit in terms of progression free survival (HR for progression or death 0.57 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.05), but for overall survival (HR for death 0.59 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.92). In the IMpower150 study (Socinski, 2018), the group with negative PD- L1 expression on both tumour cells and immune cells was considered a statistically significant benefit for the group treated with the atezolizumab combination versus the placebo combination, which was not treated with either. Nevertheless, the working group considers that even in this subgroup of treatment with a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy is in principle preferable provided the conditions mentioned in the first paragraph are met. One of the reasons for this is the limited reliability of the used biomarker PD-L1 TPS. It is known that in a significant number of patients the diagnosis NSCLC is made on very small biopsies of 2mm or less. In one study this number was 14.6% (Bigras, 2018). In this study these very small biopsys were compared to the preparations obtained after resection. This was also concluded on the basis of a statistical model that up to 35% of these very minor biopsys included misclassification of PD- L1 TPDS category (<1%, 1-49% or ≥50%). This concerned both an overestimate and an underestimate of the actual rate of PD - L1 expression. Part of the patients in the subgroup of a biopsy PD-l1 negative tumour will therefore have a tumour with some degree of PD-1 expression. For patients receiving more than half of the first-line chemotherapy no longer due to a form of tumor-oriented second-line treatment and therefore not to the potential benefits of immunotherapy (Davies, 2017; Lazzari, 2017). Nevertheless, the evidence for adding immunotherapy to treatment in this patient category is limited and chemotherapy treatment alone is certainly also a good option to discuss with patient. For the squamous NSCLC with a PD-L1 TPS <1% there was no evidence of a clinical added value of adding immunotherapeutic in any form to the standard chemotherapy therapy treatment at the time of cutting off the literature search for this directive. Also here, the results of the keynote 407 study (Paz-Ares, 2018) could no longer be included in the systematic analysis. On the basis of the above-mentioned arguments, the group of patients with a squaveiselcellig NSCLEC should be treated with the combination carboplatin plus pembrollizumab. For the treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with a non-curable NSCLC and a PD-L1 TPS ≥50%, the probative moderate is known. The same applies to patients with non-squamous NSClC independent of PD- L1 expression. For all other described treatment combinations, the GRADE scores for probative force are low to very low. In the group of patients with PCD-1 TPS &amp; 50%, there is no direct comparison between treatment leading to the best outcome. There is no immediate comparison of pembrelizumab monotherapy with either immunotherapy chemotherapy combination and these combinations are also not directly compared. On the basis of toxicity profile and financial impact, the working group prefers treatment with tembrolizumab montherapy. In specific cases and in consultation with the patient it can be deviated from one of the combinations with immunotherapy-chemotherapy. The optimal treatment duration with immunotherapeutic agents in NSCLC is not known. In both the keynote 189 and keynote 407 studies, the maintenance phase with pembrolizumab was 2 years. In the IMpower 150 study, patients in the maintenance stage with atezolizumab/bevacizumab were treated for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. There was no investigation of whether shorter or longer treatment (in the case of keynote studies) would be equally effective or better. Immunotherapy has a specific toxicity profile. For the management of immunotherapy-related toxicity, the working group refers to the ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline Management of Toxicities from Immunotherapy. An ECOG performance score ≥2, important and active autoimmune diseases, chronic use of immunosuppressant with a dose equivalent of >10mg prednisone/day and untreated or symptomatic non-small lung carcinoma brain metastasis golden as an exclusion criterion for the inclusive trial of these patients is not available on either therapy. An ECOG performance score of 2 or higher was an exclusion criterion in all studies with immunotherapy or immunochemotherapy for this line of treatment. Partly preliminary data from studies in the second-line setting, including the checkmate 153 and checkmate 171 studies (Popat, 2017; Spigel, 2017), do not show any significant survival benefit for immunotherapy in this subgroup of patients. In these patients there is therefore no place for first-line treatment with immunotherapeutic or immunotherapy chemotherapy combination. The working group considers that chemotherapy treatment should be considered and/or discussed in patients with an ECOG Performance score of 2. The working party considers that in an ECEG performance rating of 3 or 4 best supportive care treatment is preferable. Also patients with underlying autoimmune disease were excluded in most cases from the trials with immunotreatment or combination of immunotherapy as first-stage treatment. The working group considers that it is necessary for these patients to be individually weighed on the basis of characteristics of the patient, tumor and nature of the autoimmune disease. Values and preferences of patients (and possibly their caregivers) Patients and their associations of interests would like to be treated by experts in the field of lung cancer, for example by pulmonary oncologists. They indicate that they have a great interest in clearly understandable information to them about the expected effects and the expected side effects and burden of treatment, so that they can participate adequately in decision-making. In addition, they indicate that accessibility and proximity of good longoncological care for patients in all regions is important. This applies to greater extent for elderly and patients in less condition. Costs (meaning) Immunotherapeutics are significantly more expensive than regular chemotherapy. However, the exact price level of these drugs is not understandable because these means are initially placed in lock. This opinion is shared by the patient association. An adequate predictive PD-L1 test is necessary for a good choice of optimal treatment. The cost of this test is significantly higher than diagnostic immune histochemistry. This test is not conducted small cell lung carcinoma in all patients with NSCLC who may be eligible for treatment with immunotherapy. In its total, this involves a significant increase in the costs of pathological diagnostics. To this end, sufficient budget should be made available. To optimise the cost effectiveness of immunotherapeutics in current practice are both the prescribing of a fixed dose independent of body weight, as well as an extension of the dosing interval. In this case, the pharmacological exposure at a fixed dosage appears to be no less than at a dosage based on body weight and may lead to a reduction of costs, inter alia through less waste of medication (Hendrikx, 2017; Freshwater, 2017). The working group expects that there will also be an irrevocable social debate on what price level is morally socially responsible and the ethical consequences that this entails.At present, additional quality criteria for prescribing immunotherapy apply.These criteria also serve to ensure the quality of care in the use of these medications.This assurance takes place inter alia by organising the care within a (regional) network, where at least 1 immunotherapy centre is represented.From the patient's perspective of availability of care, it is necessary to create more centres where immunotherapy for the first-line treatment of NSCLC can be given, so that the additional requirements relating to registration in the existing centres are not strictly limited to what contributes to improving the safety and quality of health care.Haalability and implementation For the implementation of immunotherapy in the primary treatment of the NS CLC is on the short term of the extension of the treatment capacity at all levels required by the working group, it considers that it is not possible to consider the additional requirement for registration regarding immunotherapy to be strictly limited. This requires an extension and improvement of the organisation within the treating hospitals, but also an increasing level of organization within the current region's debt and networks, and perhaps also at national level. Proper care at the right place is essential in order to achieve this. In the longer term, the impact of the costs of immunotherapy and the associated pathological diagnostics in the oncological care in general will have to be prevented from implementing these resources. In this context, it is important that consideration is given to a structural and acceptable solution for all parties concerned in the long term. The current registration obligations associated with the authorisation to apply treatment with immunotherapeutics may also slow down the further implementation of these medications and it is therefore necessary to minimise this burden. The current registration obligations associated with the authorisation to apply immunotherapeutic therapy may also delay the further implementation of these medications and it is therefore necessary to minimise this burden. Rationale/ balance between the arguments for and against intervention On the basis of the available randomised data with moderate to low probative power, for specific patient groups with a non curative treatmentable NSCLC there is an advantage of pembrolizumab alone treatment, a combination of platinum-pemetrexed-pembrolizumab, a mix of carboplatin-paclitaxel-bevacizumab-atezolizumab or a combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel pembrilizumab compared to platinum-doublet chemotherapy or platinum-Doublet chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab. For pembrelizumab monotherapy, this benefit is seen in the patient group with a tumour PD-LPS ≥5-50%. This benefit is independent of IUPAC. For the combination carboplatin-paclitaxel-bevacizumab-atezolizumab has not been shown to have a benefit in progression-free survival in patients with non-plaveisel cell NSCLC in all PD-L1 TPS subgroups. The BOM combination has not yet been given an opinion on this combination. For the carboplatin-paclitaxel-pembrolizumab combination, an advantage for overall survival has been demonstrated in the subgroups with PD- L1 Tps <1% and 1-49% and an advantage regarding progression- free survival for all PD - L1 subgroups, thus also the subgroup with PD -L1TPS ≥50%. For this combination, a positive advice has been issued by the BOM Committee. Data on quality of life in this treatment are not available. It is highly likely that the toxicity of treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy is lower than the treatment with the mentioned chemo-immunotherapy combinations. In addition, there is lower cost. Available data is vulnerable to bias and obtained in a selected patient group with very good performance, without (symptomatic) brain metastases or active autoimmune disease and in almost all trials included patients with tumours with an activating EGFR mutation and ALK translocation. Only in the Socinski study, a small number of patients with an active EGFR change and ALk translocation are included in whom no treatment with a TKI was available anymore. Rational/ balance between arguments for and against intervention For patients with a non-curative NSCLC and an ECOG performance score ≥2 or active car-immune diseases is available which shows that treatment with immunotherapy as a secondary treatment. No comment can be made on the site of immunotherapy in patients with non-curative NSCLC and an ECOG performance score of 2 or active autoimmune diseases.Underbuilding Background The current standard first line treatment for patients with metastatic NSClC without treatable oncogenic driver mutation is, according to the 2011 NS CLC platinum-doublet chemotherapy.Now there are new developments in immunotherapy, which show that immunotherapy may be superior to platinum-Doublet chemotherapy in tumours with a PD-L1 expression >50%. In current care practice, these patients are already treated standard with pembrolizumab. Other patients may also benefit from immunotherapy treatment.

Reference: (Socinski, 2018) Summary literature Description studies A total of 9 articles of 8 studies were considered suitable to be included in this literature summary comparing different therapies. Two articles (Brahmer, 2017; Reck, 2016) reported different outcomes of the KEYNOTE- 024 study. The included studies assessed the following immunotherapys; pembrolizumab (3 studies with a total of 1,047 patients), Ipilimumab (2 studies with an overall of 1,160 patients), Nivolumab (2 trials with a Total of 2,280 patients); atezolizumab (1 study with a totally 1,200 patients of whom 800 patients are used for their literature. See table 1 and evidence tables for details of the studies. All studies included patients of multiple hospitals across different countries. The length of follow-up varied between a median of 4.2 months and 24 months. Only patients with a baseline ECOG performance status score 0 or 1 were included.

Reck (2016) included only patients with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of 50% or greater. The percentage of patients alive at 6 months was 80.2% in the pembrolizumab group versus 72.4% in the chemotherapy group. The median overall survival was not achieved in either group. 10.3 months in the pembrolizumab versus 6.0 months in a chemotherapy group in patients with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of 50% or greater. The pooled HR for progression or death was 0.50 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.68), meaning that patients in the fembrolizumab group had a higher chance of progression free survival compared to patients in a chemistry group. 3. Response rate Reck (2016) reported the response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours in a total of 305 patients. The response rate was 44.8% in the tembrolituzumab group versus 27.8% in The chemotherapy Group (RR 1.61; 95% CI 1.18 to 2.20). health status (GHS) / quality-of-life (QOL) score (scale from 0 (wurst imaginable health) to 100 (best imagintable health).Leastsquares mean baseline-to-week-15 change in QLQ-C30 GHS/QOL score was 6.9 (95% CI 3.3 to 10.6) for pembrolizumab and - 0.9 (95% CI -4.8 to 3.0) for chemotherapy (difference in least-squares means 7.8 (95% CI 2.9 to 12.8), meaning that patients treated with pembrelizumab had a clinically meanful improvement of health related quality of life compared to those treated with chemotherapy. 5. Safety (adverse events and toxicity) Reck (2016) reported the adverse events in a total of 304 patients. 73.4% of the patients in the pembroient. 21.4% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 20.7% of the sufferers in the chemotherapy group (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.67 to 3.75). Grade 3, 4, or 5 treatmentrelated adverse events occured in 26.6% of the patient in the tembrolizumab group versus 43.3% in the Chemotherapy Group (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.37 to 2.51). Furthermore, a difference in type of adverse events in both treatment arms was observed. In the chemotherapy arm haematologic adverse events as well as nausea and vomiting were seen more frequently than in the fembrolizumab arm. RCTs start at a high level of evidence. The level of quality of evidence for the outcome overall survival was downgraded with 1 level from high to moderate because of imprecision (overlap with the border of clinical survival and total number of patients <2000 per group). The levelof quality of experience for the outcomes free survival and response rate was downgraded with 1 Level from highto moderate because of impact of results (total number of patient <2000 by group). as slack of blinding (risk of bias) and imprecision (overlap with the border of clinical relationship and total number of patients <2000 per group). Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy (platinum-pemetrexed) versus placebo with chemotherapy (platinumpemetrexed). The median overall survival was not reached in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 11.3 months in the chemotherapy group. In the study of Langer (2016), 13 (22%) of 60 patients in the tembrolizumab plus Chemotherapy group and 14 (22%) or 63 patients in a chemotherapy Group had died at the time of data cutoff (median follow-up 10.6 months (IQR 8.2 to 13.3). Patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group had a higher chance of overall survival compared to patients in the chemotherapy group (Figure 1). Figure 1 Overall survival pembrelizumab with chemotherapy versus chemootherapy Z: p-value of overall effect; df: degrees of freedom; 2I: statistical heterogeneity; CI: confidence interval Ghandi (2018) reported that the benefit of the pembrolizumab combination regarding overall survival was observed in all subgroups of PD-L1 tumour proportion score, but the benefit was higher for those with a higher PD- L1 TPS (for Tumour Proposition Score); for those using a PD-l1 tumor proposition score of less 1% the 12-month overall survival rate was 61.7% vs. with a PD-L1 TPS of 50% or greater the 12-month overall survival rate was 73.0% versus 48.1%; HR 0.42 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.68). Langer (2016) did not report results for PD- L1 subgroups. 2. Progression free survival Two studies (Gandi, 2018; Langer, 2016) reported the progression free survival in a total of 739 patients. Ghandi (2018) reported a median progression free survival of 8.8 months in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group versus 4.9 months in the chemotherapy group. In the study of Langer (2016), the median progressionfree survival was 13.0 month in the Pembrolizumab plus chemistry therapy group verse 4.9 months in a chemotherapy grouping. the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group had a higher chance of progress free survival compared to patients in the chemotherapy group (figure 2). Figure 2 Progression free survival (HR for progression or death) pembrelizumab with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy Z: p-value of overall effect; df: degrees of freedom; I2: statistical heterogeneity; CI: confidence interval Ghandi (2018) reported the HR for progression-free survival for different subgroups of PD-L1 tumour proportion score. The HR was 0.75 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.05) for patients with a PD- L1 tumour proposition score of less 1% (median 6.1 months versus 5.1 months), HR 0.54 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.90) for patient score. Response rate Two studies (Ghandi, 2018; Langer, 2016) reported the response rate according in a total of 701 patients. The response rate was 48.5% in the pembrolizumab group plus chemotherapy versus 21.7% in the chemotherapy group (RR 2.27; 95% CI 1.76 to 2.93) (Figure 3). Figure 3 Response rate pembrelizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy Z: p-value of overall effect; df: degrees of freedom; 2I: statistical heterogeneity; CI: confidence interval Ghandi (2018) reported a higher response rate in the phenbrolizumab combination group than in the Chemotherapy group across all categories of PD-L1 tumor proportion score, with the greatest between-group difference in patients with a tumour progression score of 50% or greater (61.4% vs. In patients with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of less than 1% was 32.3% versus 14.3% and in patients with an score of 1 to 49% 48.4% versus 20.7%. In the study of Langer (2016), 12 or 21 patients who had a PD -L1 tumour proportion score (less than 1% achieved a response rate 57%) in the pembrolizumab combination group versus three of 23 patients (response rate 13%) in a chemotherapy alone group. Five (26%) of 19 patients who did a tumour contribution score of one to 49% and 16 (80%) or 20 patients who owned a score of 50% or greater achieved an objective response in the PMbrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus 9 of 23 subjects who had A score of 1.9%) and 6 of 17 patients who scored a score or 50% or greater. Quality of life Ghandi (2018) and Langer (2016) did not report on quality of life. 5. Safety (adverse events and toxicity) Two studies comparing pembrolizumab with chemotherapy reported adverse events (Ghandi, 2018; Langer, 2016) in a total of 728 patients. Langer (2016) reported the number of adverse events per grade, meaning that patients could have more than 1 adverse event in figure 4. Gandi (2018) reported adverse Events in a Total of 606 patients. 99.6% (404 of the 405) of the patients in the pembrelizumab plus chemotherapy versus 99.0% (200 of the 202) of those patients in a chemotherapy group had adverse Events (RR 1.1%). Patients in the pembrolizumab group plus chemotherapy versus 65.8% (n=133) in the chemotherapy group (RR1.02; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.15). In 6.7% (n=27) of the patients in the tembrolizumab group + chemotherapy vs. 5.9% (n=2) in the Chemotherapy group the adverse event led to death. 99% adverse events occured in the fembroli1/2006 combination group versus 97% in the chemistry group (rr=1.01; 95%CI 0.99 to 1.02). 63.6% grade 3, 4, or 5 treatment-related adverse events experienced in the PMbroli002 combination group vs. 56.4% in thechemotherapy group [RR] 1.14; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.63) (Ghandi, 2018; Langer, 2016); see figurary 4. combination group versus 56.4% in the chemotherapy group (RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.63) (Ghandi, 2018; Langer, 2016), see figure 4.

Lynce 2012) assessed the effect of a competitor ipilimumab regimen with carboplatin/paclitaxel a phased ipilymumab regimens with carboplatin/paccitaxel and carboplatin / paclitaxel alone and included both squamous and nonsquamous NSclC patients. Govindan (2017) only included squamous NSClC patients who were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive carboplatin and paclinavir plus blinded ipilimpumab 10mg/kg or placebo every three weeks on a phase-in. The patients with stable disease or better after induction treatment treated with their the percentage alive at 1 year, which was 54% in the ipilimumab group versus 53% in the chemotherapy group and respectively 24% and 18% after 2 years. In the study of Lynch (2012), the median survival was 9.7 months in the competitor ipilinumab group, 12.2 months in The phased ipilimpumab group and 8.3 months inthe chemotherapy group. The pooled HR for death was 0.91 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.06), favoring ipilymumab (figure 5) but the difference was not statistically significant.

Progression-free survival Two studies comparing ipilumumab plus chemistry versus chemistry Z: Govindan (2017) reported a median progression free survival of 5.6 months in both groups. In the study of Lynch (2012), the median progressionfree survival was 5.5 months in the competitor ipilimumab group, 5.7 months in the phased ipilinumab group and 4.6 months in The chemotherapy group. The pooled HR for progression or death was 0.84 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.96), favoring ipilimumab (figure 6).

Quality of life None of the included studies comparing ipilimpumab plus chemistry treated with chemotherapy reported on quality of life. 5. Safety (adverse events and toxicity) Two studies comparing Ipilim TARGET plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy treated adverse events (Govindan, 2017; Lynch, 2012) in a total of 952 patients.

Patients could have more than one adverse event thus the number Of events was higher than the total number of patients. Grade 3, 4, or 5 treatment-related adverse events occured in approximately 54.2% of the patients in the ipilimumab group versus 41.3% in the chemotherapy group (RR 1.1.8; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.56) (Govindan, 2017; Lynn, 2012), see figure 8. comparison ipilimumab with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy There are four levels of evidence: high, moderate, low, and very low. RCTs start at a high level of evidence. The level of quality of evidence for the outcome overall survival was downgraded with 2 levels from high to low because of limitations in the study design such as unclear allocation concealment, slack of blinding, violation of the intent to treat analysis and the involvement of the pharmaceutical industry (risk of bias) and imprecision (confidence interval crossing through hold for no difference). analysis and the involvement of the pharmaceutical industry (risk of bias) and imprecision (confidence interval crossing threat for no difference).

Nivolumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy 1. Overall survival (critical outcome) One study compared nivolumab with chemotherapy and reported on overall survival (Carbone, 2017). 541 patients with squamous and non-squamous NSCLC, an ECOG performance status score of 0 to 1 and a PD-L1 TPS ≥1% were randomly assigned to receive nivolovir or chemotherapy [6]. The paper reported on overall survival in the group of patients with a PD -L1TPS ≥5% (n=223). This was comparable with all random patients (median survival 13.3 months versus 13.8 months HR 1.07 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.33)). In an exploration and not pre-specified subgroup analysis involving patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 50% or more, the HR for death was 0.90 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.29). 2. Progression free survival Two studies comparing nivolumab with chemotherapy reported progress free survival (Carbone, 2017; Hellmann, 2018) in a total of 573 patients. Hellman (2018) reported a median progression free survival in patients with Tumour Mutational Burden (TMB) ≥10 Mutations/Mb and ≥1% Tumour PD- L1 Expression (patents with a P.L1 expression level of <1% were not eligible to repeat in the The median progression free survival was 4.2 months in the nivolumab group versus 5.6 months in a chemotherapy group. In the study of Carbone (2017), the median progressionfree survival in patients with a PD-L1 expression level of ≥5% was 4.2 months in the Nivolumab Group versus 5.9 months in The chemotherapy Group. versus chemotherapy Z: p-value of overall effect; df: degrees of freedom; 2I: statistical heterogeneity; CI: confidence interval 3. Response rate One study (Carbone, 2017) compared nivolumab with chemotherapy and reported the response rate in a total of 223 patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5%. The response rate was 26% in the nivol1/2001 group versus 33% in the chemotherapy group (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.00), favoring chemotherapy. In an exploratory subgroup analysis involving patients with any PD- L1 expression Level of 50% or more, the response rates were 34% in the Nivolumab group (n=88 patients) and 39% in the Chemotherapy group. compare nivolumab with chemotherapy reported treatment-related adverse events (Carbone, 2017; Hellmann, 2018) in a total of 1,491 patients. The safety data in the study of Hellman (2018) was exploratory. Approximately 67% of the patients in the nivolimab group versus 84% of the sufferers in the chemotherapy group had adverse events (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.83), favoring nivol1/2001. Grade 3, 4, or 5 treatment-associated adverse events occured in approximately 18% of the patient's in the Nivolumab group vs 41% in the Chemotherapy group (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.64) (Carbone, 2017); Helmann, 2018, see figure 10 Safety (adverse events and toxicity) nivolvalent versus chemotherapy: interval Level of evidence nivolumab versus chemotherapy There are four levels of evidence: high, moderate, low, and very low. RCTs start at a high level of evidence. The level of quality of evidence for the outcome overall survival was downgraded with 2 levels from high to low because of limitations in the study design such as unclear allocation concealment and vibration of the intent to treat analysis (risk of bias) and imprecision (confidence interval crossing threat for no difference). The level Of quality of experience for the outside measures free survival and response rate was downgraded with 3 levels by high to very low cause of limits in the studies bias), inconsistency of results (variance of point estimates across studies) and imprecision (confidence interval crossing threat for no difference).

Progression free survival One study comparing nivolumab plus ipilimumab with chemotherapy reported progress free survival (Hellmann, 2018) in a total of 299 patients with squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC and an ECOG performance-status score of 0 to 1 selected on a tumor proportional burden (TMB) of ≥10 implications/megabase. Hellmann (2018) reported a median progression free survival of 4.9 months in the nivol TARGET plus ipilimumab group versus 5.5 months in The chemotherapy group. The progression-free survival rate at 1 year was 30.9% in the nilimumab plus the The HR for progression or death was 0.83 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.96), favoring nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Patients with a high tumor mutational burden (TMB) (≥10 analogys per megabase) had a 1-year progressionfree survival rate of 42.6% in the nivolimab plus ipilimumab versus 13.2% in the chemotherapy group, and the median progression-free survival was 7.2 months versus 5.5 months (HR, 0.58; 97.5% CI 0.41 to 0.81). Among patients with a low tumor correlation burden (<10 correlations permegabase), the median progressfree survival rates were 3.2 months with nivolimumab plusnimirumab and 5.5 months with chemotherapy (HR 1.07; 95% CI 0.85). The study protocol was amended after activation of all patients had been completed (but before primary database lock) to include tumor proportional Burden based efficacy analyses. Subgroup analysis among the in the initial protocol not pre-specified subgroup of patients with a high TMB according to PD-L1 status showed that progression-free survival was longer with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy among patients with an PD- L1 expression level of at least 1% (HR for progression or death 0.62 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.88) and those with a level of less than 1% (hr 0.48 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.85). 3. Response rate One study (Hellmann, 2018) compared nivol TARGET plus ifilimumab with chemotherapy and reported the response rate in a total of 299. the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group versus 26.9% in the chemotherapy group (RR 1.69 95% CI 1.23 to 2.31), favoring nivolimab plus ipilimumab. 4. Quality of life The included study comparing nivolovir plus iphilimumab versus chemotherapy did not report on quality of life. 5. Safety (adverse events and toxicity) One study comparing nivolumab with chemotherapy reported treatment-related adverse events (Hellmann, 2018) in a total of 1,146 patients. Approximately 75% of the patients in the ni volumab plus tipimumab Group versus 81% of the patient group had adverse events in the Chemotherapy Group (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.88), favoring nivilimumab plus insulinumab. the patients in the nivolumab group plus ipilimumab versus 36% in the chemotherapy group (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.02) (Hellmann, 2018). Level of evidence comparison nivolimab with Ipilimmune versus chemotherapy There are four levels of evidence: high, moderate, low, and very low. RCTs start at a high level of evidence. As none of the included studies reported data on overall survival and quality of life, it was not possible to assess the level of efficacy. The level of quality of evidence for the other outcomes was downgraded with 3 levels from very low, because of limitations in the study design as slack of blinding, loose to follow-up and select outporting (exposite) and Atezolizumab, bevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel (ABCP) versus bevacizumab, carboplatin and Paclitaxel, (BCP) 1. Overall survival One study compared ABCP with BCP in a total of 800 nonsquamous NSCLC patients with an ECOG performance status score of 0 to 1 (Socinski, 2018). After a protocol amendment the primary endpoint overall survival was reported in the 692 patients who had a wild-type genotype (WT population; patients with EGFR or ALK genetic alterations were excluded). The percentage of patients alive at 1 year was 67.3% of the 356 patients in the ABCP group versus 60.6% of the 336 patients in The BCP group. The median survival was 19.2 months and 14.7 months, respectfully. One study comparing ABCP with BCP reported progress free survival (Socinski, 2018) in a total of 692 patients in the WT population. The median progression free survival was 8.3 months om the ABCP group versus 6.8 months om The BCP group. The progression free surveillance rate at 1 year was 36.5% in the BCP Group versus 18.0% in the BCP Group. The HR for progression or death was 0.62 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.74), favoring ABCP. In the high expression of an effector T-cell gene signature (high Teff) WT populations (n=284 patients) progression free survival was longer in the ABCP group than in the bCP group in the mean 11.3 months versus6.8 months, HR 0.51 (95% CI.38 to 0.38). was 71.7% in the ABCP group as compared with 57.0% in the BCP group; the corresponding rates at 12 months were 46.0% and 18.0%. In the subgroup of patients with low or negative PD-L1 expression (PD-L2 expression on <50% of tumour cells and <10% of tumor-infiltrating immune cells), progression-free survival was longer with BCP than with BCP (median 8.0 months versus 6.8 months, HR 0.68 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.82). Progression free survival was also longer with ABCP in the subgroups with high PD- L1 expression (median 12.6 months  vs 6.8 months , HR 0.39 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.60). The response rate was 63.5% in the ABCP group versus 48.0% in the BCP group (RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.52), favoring ABCP. In the Teff-high WT population the response rate is 69.3% in the BCP Group (106 of the 153) versus 53.5% in The BCP Group (68 of the 127) (RR 1.29 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.57). events occured in 55.7% of the patients in the ABCP group versus 47.7% in the BCP group (RR 1.17; 95% CI1.02 to 1.34), favoring BCP. Grade 5 treatment-related adverse events occurd in 2.8% of the sufferers in the BCP Group versus 2.3% in the bCP group. Level of evidence comparison ABCP versus BCP There are four levels of evidence: high, fashionate, low, and very low. RCTs start at a high level of evidence. As none of the included studies reported data on the quality of life, it was not possible to assess the level of efficacy. The level of quality of evidence for the other measures was downgraded with 2 levels from low, because of limitations in the study of isolation and the intent to treat analysis (risk of bias) and 1 level for imprecision (confidence intervals crossed the threat for clinical survival).

Recommendation In patients with incurable NSCLEC (non-curatively treatable stage III-IV) with tumours with a PD-L1 of less than 1% treatment with the 9LA regimen (nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus chemotherapy) as an alternative to standard chemotherapy? However, a significant and clinically relevant extension of the primary endpoint, overall survival, seen for patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab with 2 cycles of chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone, appears to be particularly valuable in the group with absent PD-L1 expression (PD-L1, < 1 percent) and/or co-mutations predicting a smaller effect on immune therapy. Examples of this are KEAP1 and STK11, although the precise value of this is still under investigation and there is no prospective study on these specific comutations. Furthermore, no direct comparison with chemoimmune therapy has taken place. In the CheckMate 9LA study, most of the benefits of the nevertheless heavy and toxic treatment were obtained in the younger patient (in any case less than 75 years of age) with a smoke history. Patients with liver metastases had the worse treatment. The 9LA schedule is a good alternative to the standard treatment in this group of patients, namely platinum doublet chemotherapy and pembrolizumab and can be considered for selected patients.",

Evidence of the literature The working group concludes that the evidence for the effect of double immune therapy in combination with chemotherapy in the Netherlands for patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma with stage IIIB/C/IV without EGFR mutation or ALK re-arrangement is very low. This means that the actual effect may be substantially different from the effect from the study. Methodological limitations (in particular indirectness) are the basis for this. Professional perspective For the PD-L1 <1%, no randomized data are available. The effect of monoimmunotherapy for this group is very small and is not advised. The standard treatment for this class is chemoimmune therapy. There are indications that the 9LA schedule allows a relevant survival benefit for a selected population. The abstract of the ASCO 2023 shows that the 4-year results, a survival rate (OS rate) of 23% for this type of chemotherapy is very weak and is therefore not recommended. 23% for the double immunotherapy plus chemotherapy group compared to 13% in the chemotherapy arm for the cohort with PD-L1 <1% (HR: 0.66-0.50-0.86)). The survival rates for the cohort with PD-L1<1% in the immune therapy mon plus chemotherapy group are lower: 16.0% (Garassino, 2023) and 15.8% (Novello, 2023). (Table 1).

Costs According to the NVMO commission BOM advice costs the treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab per 6 weeks administration respectively 7946,64 euro and 7125,30 euro (at a weight of 70 kg) (NVMO committee for Evaluation of Oncological Resources, 2021).The price per treatment (including 2 cycles of chemotherapy with pemetrexed) comes out at approximately 70,000 euro (median treatment duration 6.1 months). treatment with chemo-immunotherapy seems more effective in patients with a PD-L1 expression of 1-50% than in patients With a PD -L1 expression of <1%. Dual immunotherapy with chemotherapy regimens might be an alternative treatment for these patients, but no randomized research has been conducted in this population. In this module, the available evidence for dual immunotherapy for PD - L1 subgroups is described. In line with international guidelines, the focus is on PD - l1 expression, of <1%). survival compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC with a PD-L1<1%, but the evidence is very uncertain.

CheckMate 227 (part 1) described a randomized, open-label, international, multi-center phase III trial, with a minimum follow-up length of 61.3 months. They evaluated the efficacy and safety of first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolimab (plus chemotherapy if PD-L1 <1%) versus chemotherapy in patients with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC that was not previously treated with chemotherapy. A total of 1739 patients was randomized to receive nivol1/2001 (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/ kg every 6 weeks) (n=583), nivol TARGET (240 mg every 2 week or 360 mg every 3 weeks if PD -L1<1%) (plus chemotherapyif PD- L1 <1%, based on tumour histologic type for up to four weeks) The median age (range) for PD-L1 ≥1% was 64 (26-84), 64 (27-85) and 64 (29-87) for the three groups, respectfully. The average age (variate) forPD-L1, <1% was 63 (34-87), 64 (30-89), and 64 (30-80) for that three groups was 74, 73 and 67%, respectively. The following relevant outcomes were reported: overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), adverse events (AEs), quality of life (Qo). The results of the first interim analysis (Paz-Ares, 2021; median follow-up of 9.7 months) were followed by a 2-year update of efficacy and safety (Reck, 2021) and quality of life (Rck, 2023; medium follow- up of 30.7 months). A 4-year update is expected to be published in 2023. They evaluated the efficacy and safety of first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in patients with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC. A total of 719 patients was randomized to receive nivolbeta (360 mg every 3 weeks) plus epilimumab (one) plus chemotherapy plus chemotherapy alone in patient with stage NSclC. The median age (range) was 65 (59-70) in the dual immunotherapy plus chemotherapy group and 65 (58-70) into the chemotherapy group. In the dual immunosuppressive group 70% were males, compared with 70% in the chemotherapy Group. The following relevant outcomes were reported: OS, PFS, ORR, AES, QoL. Subgroup analyses were done according to age, gender, performance status, smoking status, histology type, liver metastases, bone metastasses, CNS metastasees and PD-L1 status. Rizvi (2020) MYSTIC described a randomized, open-label, international, multi-center phase III trial, with a mediumn follow-up of 30.2 months. The median age (range) was 65 (34-87), 64 (32-84), and 65 (35-85) for the three groups, respectfully. The proportion of males in the three bands was 72, 69 and 65%, respectively. The following relevant outcomes were reported: OS, PFS, ORR, AEs, QoL. Subgroup analyses were done according to their respective levels ≥1%. Subgroup analyses were done according to PD-L1 expression level (<1%, ≥1%, 25-49%, ≥50%). Results Nivolumab plus ipilimumab with chemotherapy Currently, treatment with nivolumab + ipilymumab is the only available dual immunotherapy treatment in the Netherlands for patients with NSCLC stage IIIB/C/IV without sensitizing oncogenic driver variants. In practice, immunotherapy is combined with chemotherapy to accelerate the effect. (95% CI: 7.7-13.7) in the CT group (89 events/129 patients) in the interim analysis with a minimum follow-up of 8.1 months (Paz-Ares, 2021). Further peer-reviewed results are awaited. Progression-free survival PD-L1 <1% In patients with a PD- L1 expression level of <1%, the median progression-free surveillance (PFS) was 5.8 months (95% CI: 4.4 to 7.6) in the dual immunotherapy plus CT group (44 events/135 patients) and 4.6 months (95%CI: 4.2 to 5.6) in The CT group [28 events/129 patients] in the interim analysis with a minimum follow-up of 6.5 months (Paz-Ares, 2021). in the dual immunotherapy plus CT group and 4.9 months (95% CI: 4.2 to 5.7) in the CT group with a minimum follow-up of 23.3 months (Rck, 2021). The hazard ratio was 0.68 (95% CI; 0.51 to 0.89) in the double immunotherapy group. As the median overall survival in the control group was <12 months, the clinical relationship of PFS was not considered. The 2023 ASCO meeting abstract of the 4-year results reported an PFS rate of 12% for the dual immune therapy plus CT Group versus 3% in the CAT group for the PD-L1 <1% cohort (Carbone, 2023). (26/129 patients, 95% CI: 13.6 to 28.1) in the CT group in the interim analysis with a minimum follow-up of 6.5 months (Paz-Ares, 2021). The relative risk was 1.54 (95% CI: 1.00 to 2.36) in favour of the dual immunotherapy group. In the 2-year update, the ORRs in patients with a PD-L1 expression level of <1% were consistent with the results of the interim analytical (Reck, 2021) Adverse events The CheckMate 9LA study did not report PD- L1 subgroup data on adverse events. In the 2-year update, these percentages were similar (48% versus 38%) (Rck, 2021). The most common adverse events grade ≥3 were neutropenia (7% vs. 9%), anaemia (6% vs. 14%), diarrhoea (4% vs. 1%), increased lipase (6% v. 1%) and febrile neutropenias (4% v. 3%). Quality of life The CheckMate 9LA study did not report PD-L1 subset data on quality of life. In the total population, the least squares mean change from baseline for EQ-5D-3L VAS was 2.5 in the dual immunotherapy plus CT group and 0.6 in the CT group. The difference between treatment was 1.8 (95% CI: - 0.4 to 3.9) in the favor of the dual immune therapy plus CT grouping. The least squares mean change from baseline for EQ-5D-3L UI was 0.029 (95% CI: -0.001 to 0.059) in favour of the dual immunotherapy plus CT group (Reck, 2023). * The PD-L1 status was quantitative for 338 out of 361 patients (94%) in the dual immune therapy group, and in 333 out of 358 patients (93%) in the control group. PD- L1 expression on hopeless tumour cells was assisted with immunohistochemical 28-8 pharmDx assay (Paz- Ares, 2021). Level of evidence The evidence for the outcomes for the OS, PFS and ORR was derived from observational data from groups of the above levels. The level of evidence for the outcome of adverse events and quality of life started at •high.The level of experience regarding the outcome overall survival was downgraded by three levels because of study limitations (risk of bias): open-label study and role of fund); applicability (bias due to indirectness: reference treatment); and number of inclusive patients (imprecision).Therefore, the level ofevidence was graded as very low.The Level of evidence regards the outcome and The level of evidence regarding the outcome of measurement response rate was downgraded by three levels because of study limitations (risk of bias); applicability (bias due to indirectness: reference treatment); and number of included patients (imprecision). The level of evidence regarding the outcome measure quality of life was downgraded by three levels because of study limitations (risk of bias); applicability (bias due to indirectness: reference treatment); and number of included patients (imprecision). Therefore, the level of Non-small cell lung cancer evidence was graded as very low. Search and select A systematic review of the literature was performed to answer the following question: What are the effects of first-line dual immunotherapy with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy, single immunotherapy or a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in patients with non-sensing cell cancer? combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without sensitizing oncogenic driver variants? P: patients with Non-Small-cell lung cancer, Stage IIIB/C/IV without sensitivity oncogene driver variants; I: first-line dual immunotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, chemotherapy or single immunotherapy; O: overall survival, progression-free survival, response rate, adverse events, quality of life. A prior, the working group did not define the outcome measures listed above but used the definitions used in the studies. If mOS in controlgroup ≤12 months: Overall survival: >12 weeks and hazard ratio (HR)<0.7 If mos in control group >12 months; Overall survival; >16 weeks and HR<0.7 Progression-free survival: <16 weeks &lt;25% for severity of life: A relevant difference available (only defined by PASKWIL for non-randomized studies) Adverse events: absolute difference <5% for and select (Methods) The databases Medline (via OVID) and Embase (via Embase.com) were searched with relevant search terms from 2018 to March 24, 2023. The detailed search strategy is defined under the tab Methods. The systematic literature search resulted in 297 hits. Studies were selected based on the following criteria: The study population had to meet the criteria as defined in the PICO; The intervention and comparison had to be as identified in the PICO and reported at least one of the outcomes as defined by the PI CO; Research type: Systematic review; RCT; Articles write in English or Dutch. The working group decided not to expand the search with observational studies. This result in a disproportionate amount of additional work, without additional value for the purpose of the protocol. The 115 articles from the systemic review were screened on title and abstract, from which 18 were initially selected. After reading the full text, 17 systematic reviews were excluded (see the table with reactions for exclusion under the tab Methods), and one systematic review was included. The selected systematic review by Shen (2021) included RCTs on PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors combined with CTLA-Outlook Question What is the place of immunotherapy or a combination of immunotherapeutic and chemotherapy in the second line (secondary or tertiary treatment) in patients with stage IIIB/C/IV NSCLC. Recommendation The following recommendations apply to patients with noncurative treatment NSclC, performance score 0-1, no contra-indication for immunotherapy and without molecular abberation where an targeted therapy is available (see module  accomplished by metastatic NSCOLL) with rare mutation. Consider the treatment with nivolumab or atezolizumab in the second line provided there are no contraindications and regardless of PD-L1. No direct evidence has been obtained for the optimal treatment of patients with a performance score 2. These patients have been included in the registration studies for immunotherapy versus docetaxel. Retrospective data shows that immunotherapy in this group of patients could have added value, for example in patients who do not tolerate chemotherapy. If chemotherapy is possible, it is preferable based on current literature. Consider in patients with performance score 2 primary treatment with chemotherapy or best supportive care after platinum doubles as first therapy. The survival and quality of life in patients eligible for second-line treatment is still limited, despite recent progress with patients who are eligible for secondary treatment also the possibility of supportive pallitive care. The individual studies examined in subgroups and in highly selected patients have also been performed in sub-groups. Therefore, there is a lack of small cell lung carcinoma. The available randomized trials show shortcomings in different areas as mentioned above. As a result there is significant risk of bias and the GRADE scores for evidence of the studies have been revised downwards. For second-line treatment with pembrolizumab of patients with NSCLC and a PD-L1 TPS >50% there is reasonable evidence of positive advice from the Bom Committee. For secondary treatment with nivolumab and atezolizumab of subjects with NSCLC independent of PD- L1 TDS there is low probative force. Patients with a performance score of 2 are excluded from participation in the studies. This gives this group of patients a very large knowledge gap regarding the choice of optimal treatment. In addition, the possible different quality of life in the use of immunotherapy compared with docetaxel is not sufficiently taken into account. Values and preferences of patients (and possibly their caregivers) Patients and their associations of interests are happy to be treated by experts in the field of lung cancer, for example by pulmonary oncologists. Accessibility and proximity of good lung oncology care for patients in all regions. However, the price level for patients is important, especially for elderly and patients in less condition. Cost (recording) The price level in 2019 shows that immunotherapeutics are more expensive than regular chemotherapy. However the price price level is not clear by price agreements with the government. However from a medical, political and social point of view, the current price of the new drugs is acceptable for use in practice. A lower price of immunotherapeutic drugs would be desirable for the whole society. The patient association also shares this opinion. On the basis of the CieBOM advice for the Pembrolizumab in the 2nd line the advice it is appropriate to use at a PD-L1 value of 50% or more. This test is carried out in all eligible patients, i.e. a larger group than that being treated. Within the pharmacovigilance budget a part should be reserved for predictive testing. From a medical, political and social point of view, the current price level of the predictive test is considered acceptable in relation to the effectiveness of the treatment. Admissibility for the other relevant stakeholders At present there are additional quality criteria for the use of immunotherapy. A high and non-small cell lung carcinoma good quality is highly desirable. These can be secured from a (regional) network. From the patient's perspective regarding the availability, and from the social perspective of registering less can be considered to facilitate the additional requirements relating to registration and scientific research for the usage of a second line. The available data shows that there are fewer treatment related adverse events in immunotherapy than in chemotherapy, the available data on quality of life is even more limited, however, it shows a similar (atezolizumab) or better quality of living (nivolumab) than chemotherapy. Underbuilding Background The second-line treatment in non-small cell lung carcinoma is variable. It very much depends on which medication is given as first-line therapy, the type of tumor and condition of the patient. Also, in the second line treatment due to the rapid new developments in the future, there will be a lot of innovation. This applies to patients with a performance score between 0 to 2. For less fit patients with performance 3 to 4, the standard is a supportive palliative treatment without tumor-oriented therapy.

GRAde References: - Summary literature Description studies A total of seven articles were considered suitable to be included in this literature summary comparing different therapies. These articles reported results of 5 different trials (CheckMate 017, CheckMate 057, Keynote 010, OAK, and POPLAR). Huang (2018) performed a meta-analysis using data of these trials. The POPLAR and OAK trials involved the anti-PD-L1 antibody (atezolizumab) versus the second-line chemotherapy docetaxel for previously treated NSCLC, while anti-PD-L1, antibodies were included in the CheckMate-017, CheckMATE-057 (both nivolumab) and KEYNOTE-010 (pembrolizumab) trials.The minimum follow-up of the results described in Huang (2017) was 11 and 13.2 months for the Checkmate 017 and CheckMata 057, respectively. The mediumn follow-ups were 13.1 months in the KEYNOTE 010 trial, 14.8 months in The OAK trial and 14.8 months in the POPLAR trial. In addition to the results in the checkMate 01 and Checkmote 057, respectively. Reported in patients atting the CheckMate-017 (Reck, 2017), CheckMata-057 (Reck, 2018) and the OAK trials (Bordoni, 2018). Horn (2017) and Vokes (2018) provided respectfully 2-years and 3-years results of the Check Mate-017, and CheckMates-057 trials. Fehrenbacher (2018) provided results of an additional 7 months follow-up of the Oak trial. The included studies assessed the following immunotherapys; nivolumab (2 studies with a total of 854 patients), pembrolizumab (1 study with 1,034 patients) and atezolizumab (2 studies involving a totalof 1,137 patients). See table 1 and evidence tables for details of studies. Studies were funded by the pharmaceutical industry.

Figure 1 Overall survival immunotherapy versus chemotherapy Z: p-value of overall effect; df: degrees of freedom; 2I: statistical heterogeneity; CI: confidence interval Horn (2017) reported the 2-year outcomes of the CheckMate 017 and CheckMote 057 trials and found consistent survival rates at 1 and 2 years (pooled HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.84). Also after 3 years The pooled medium overall survival was 11.1 months in the nivolumab group versus 8.1 months in a chemotherapy group. Fehrenbacher (2018) reported an update of the OAK trial with an additional 7-months follow-up. The HR was consistent with the previous reported results (HR 0.75;95% CI 0.64 to 0.89). The median overall survival rate was 13.8 months on the atezolizumab group  vs. 9.6 months in The chemotherapy Group. Subgroups The KEYNOTE-010 trial (pembrolizumab) included patients PD-L1 expression on at least 1% tumour cells, the other trials included subgroups 1-49% and ≥50%, the HRs for death were 0.76 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.96) and 0.53 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.70) respectfully. were not clinically relevant (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.49 to 1.15 (nivolumab) and HR 0.81; 0.62 to 1.07 atezolizumab) (Figure 3).

The Checkmate 017 only included patients with squamous cell NSCLC and the Checkmate 057 includes non-cells. only included patients with non-squamous cell NSCLC. The KEYNOTE 010 trial (pembrolizumab) reported a not clinically relevant HR for overall survival of HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.09) for patients with squamous-cell NSCLEC and a clinically relevant HR of 0.63 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.79) for subjects with adenocarcinoma. 0.73 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.98) and non-squamous disease (0.73 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.89), but these HRs were not clinically relevant. 2. Progression free survival All five trials compare immunotherapy with chemotherapy reported progress free survival (Huang, 2018), see figure 4. The pooled hazard ratio for progression free survival showed a clinically relevant difference in progression free survival for patients receiving pembrolizumab, regarding of the doses, compared to chemotherapy (pooled HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.72). differences for nivolumab (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.14) and atezolizumab (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08) compared to docetaxel. Figure 4 Progression free survival (HR for progression or death) immunotherapy versus chemotherapy Z: p-value of overall effect; df: degrees of freedom; I2: statistical heterogeneity; CI: confidence interval Differences in progression free rates, which favored nivolBV over docetaxel, were consistent at 1 and 2 years in patients (Horn, 2017: CheckMate 017 and CheckMATE 057). 7-months follow-up was consistent with the previous reported results (HR 0.75;95% CI 0.64 to 0.89) (Fehrenbacher, 2018). Subgroups The KEYNOTE-010 trial (pembrolizumab) included patients PD-L1 expression on at least 1% tumour cells (see figure 1), the other trials included patients regarding the PD- L1 expression. The KEYNOTE-010 trial did report progression free survival for the PD - L1 subgroups 1-49% and ≥50%, the HRs for progression free Not small cell lung cancer survival were 1.04 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.27) and 0.59 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.74) respectfully. (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.88), but not for atezolizumab (HR 0.89; 95%CI 0.75 to 1.06) compared to chemotherapy. The HRs for nivolumab and atezoliczumab did not show improvement in progress free survival over docetaxel in PD-L1 negative patients (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.61 and HR 1.03; 0.83 to 1.26, respectively). In addition, the trials performed subgroup analyses based on histology. The Checkmate 017 only included patients with squamous-cell NSCLC and the Checkmate 057 only included patient with non-squamous cell NSCLEC. The KEYNOTE 010 trial (pembrolizumab) reported compatible free survival of HR 0.86 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.20) for patient with 0. Response rate All five trials comparing immunotherapy with chemotherapy reported the overall response rate according to RECIST (Huang, 2018), see figure 5. Patients receiving nivolumab had a higher clinical response rate compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. The pooled response rate was 19.2% in the nivolimab group versus 11% in the chemotherapy group (RR 1.73; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.42). Also patients receiving pembrolizumab group had a superior clinical response ratio compared to patient receiving chemotherapy, with a pooled response rate of 18.2 in the pembrelizumab Group versus 9.3% in the Chemotherapy Group (RR 1.95; 95% CI 1.47 to 2.59). No difference were found between patients receiving atezolizumab or docetaxel. The response rate was 13.8% in the atezolizumab groups versus 13.7% in the chemotherapy group (RR 1.01; 95% CI 1.47 to Figure 5 Response rate immunotherapy versus chemotherapy Z: p-value of overall effect; df: degrees of freedom; 2I: statistical heterogeneity; CI: confidence interval The objective response rates at 2 years (Horn, 2017) and 3 years (Vokes, 2018) did not change from those reported in the primary analyses (1-year of minimum follow-up) and were higher with nivolumab than with docetaxel. Quality of life Three studies reported health related quality of life of patients receiving either immunotherapy or chemotherapy. The reported difference of 7.2 (95% CI 0.6 to 13.8) in mean change on the EQ-5D VAS was clinically relevant. Reck (2018) observed improvements in HRQoL with nivolumab but not with docetaxel by the VAS (difference in mean changes 5.9; 95% CI 2.2 to 9.7), but this was not a clinically relevant difference. The utility index indicated stable health status throat treatment in both arms (different in mean changing 0.034; 95% CI - 0.009 to 0.076). Bordoni (2018) reported health related quality of life in patients receiving atezolizumab or chemotherapy (OAK trial) measured with the EORTC Quality-of-Life Core Question (QLQ-C30). The atezolizumab-treated patients reported numerically improved HRQoL from baseline starting at cycle 3 and continuing until cycle 13. 5. Safety (adverse events and toxicity) All five trials comparing immunotherapy with chemotherapy reported treatment-related adverse events. Patients receiving nivolumab had a clinically relevant difference of 26% less adverse events (all grades) compared to patients with chemotherapy (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.86). Patients receiving pembrolizumab had 20% less adverse events compared to suffers with chemotherapy (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.66) and patients receiving atezoliczumab had 25% less interesting events comparing to patients recovering chemotherapy (RR 0.755; 95%CI 0.74) and patients recovering atezolizumab. atezolizumab had 25% less adverse events compared to patients receiving chemotherapy (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.80) (figure 6). Figure 6 Treatment-related adverse events (any grade) immunotherapy versus chemotherapy Z: p-value of overall effect; df: degrees of freedom; 2I: statistical heterogeneity; CI: confidence interval All immunotherapys resulting in clinically relevant less severe adverse events [grade 3.4, or 5] compared to chemotherapy (7) Patients receiving nivolumab had 83% less serious adverse events matched to patients with chemotherapy (RR 0.17; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.25) patients receiving pembrolizumab had 59% less serious adverse events occurring with chemotherapy 0. atezolizumab had 66% less serious adverse events compared to patients receiving chemotherapy (RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.41). Figure 7 Treatment-related adverse events (grade ≥3) immunotherapy versus chemotherapy Z: p-value of overall effect; df: degrees of freedom; 2I: statistical heterogeneity; CI: confidence interval Rates of the most frequently reported treatment-related AES at two years (Horn, 2017) and three years (Vokes, 2018) in the CheckMate 017 and CheckMATE 057 trials maintained similar to those reported in the primary analyses (1 year). RCTs start at a high level of evidence. Nivolumab The level of quality of evidence for the outcome overall survival, response rate and quality of life was downgraded with 2 levels from high to low because of impact of results (overlap with the border of clinical relevance). The levelof quality of experience for the progress free survival was downgraded with 3 levels from very low due of inconsistency of results [variance of point estimates across studies] and imprecision of results (\"overlap\" with the edge of clinical relivance). The Level of efficacy for the outcomes was downrated with 2 degrees to low cause of error of incidence of incidence. survival and response rate was downgraded with 1 level from high to moderate because of imprecision of results (overlap with the border of clinical relevance). The level of quality of evidence for the outcome was downgraded with 2 levels from high To low cause of limitations in the study design such slack of blinding (subjective outcome) and impreciation of results (\"small number of events\"). As the included study did not report data on the quality of life, it was not possible to assess the level of evidence. Unclear randomization method, unclear or no allocation concealment and slack of blinding, imprecision of results (total number of patients <2000 per group). Search and select To answer our clinical question a systematic literature analysis was formulated for the following research questions and accompaniment PICO: What is the effectiveness and safety of second-line immunotherapy with PD-1-, PD-L1- and CTLA4 inhibitors in patients with non-all-cell lung cancer stage IIIB/IV without sensitizing oncogenic drivers associated to chemotherapy? P (population) patients with Non-poverty-cell cancer stage IIB/iv with progression or after chemotherapy and white sensitising oncgenic drivers; I (intervention) O (outcome) overall survival, progress free survival, response rate, quality of life, safety (adverse events and toxicity). Relevant outcome measures The working group considered overall survival a critical outcome measure for the decision making process; and progress free surveillance, response rates, qualityof life, security (adversity events and toxicity) important outcome measures for decision making. The working Group defined clinically relevant differences as follow: Overall survival: >12 weeks or hazard ratio <0.7 Progression free survival:>12 weeks nor hazard ratio<0.7 Adverse events and toxicity: chemotherapy was considered standard of care for patients with an adequate performance status, despite rendering responses in only 7.1 to .1% (Schvartsman, 2017). Quality of care: The minimum important difference (MID) has been estimated to be a difference of 0.08 or more points for the EQ-5D utility index and seven or more point for the EQ-5D VAS (Pickard, 2007). Search and select (Methods) The databases Medline (via OVID) and Embase (via Embase.com) were searched from 1st of January 2005 up to September 2018 using relevant search terms for systemic reviews (SRs), random controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (OBS). The detailed search strategy is developed under the tab Methods. The detailed search strategy is defined under the tab Methods. The systematic literature search results in 519 hits. Studies were selected based on the following criteria: systematic review or randomized trials including patients with non-opportunitiesmall-cell lung cancer stage IIIB/IV with progression during or after chemotherapy and without sensitizing oncogenic driver variants and comparing immunotherapy with PD-1-, PD-L1- and CTLA4- inhibitors. 60 studies were initially selected based upon title and abstract. After reading the full text, 53 studies were excluded (see the table with reactions for exclusion under the Tab Methods), and seven articles were decidedly included in the literature summary.

Cancer: Two-Year Outcomes From Two Randomized, Open-Label, Phase III Trials (CheckMate 017 and CheckMate 057). J Clin Oncol. 2017 Dec 10;35(35):3924-3933. doi: Baseline Question Which second and/or third-line treatment in non-small cell lung cancer is preferred after immune therapy and platinum doublet (at the same time or consecutively) in the first line and/ or second line? Recommendation Consider treatment with docetaxel as a follow-up treatment after previous treatment with immune therapy or platinum-doublet chemotherapy in patients with incurable NSCLC (noncuratively treatable Stage III-IV) without driver mutation. Consider a re-challenge with immunotherapy or chemoimmune therapy if there was a therapy-free interval between the last treatment with immunity and disease progression, and if the immune therapy was not previously discontinued due to severe toxicity. In previous trials, docetaxel in the second line compared to best supportive care (BSC) showed better overall survival (OS) and longer 1-year survival compared to other chemotherapy agents (Fossella, 2000; Fossella, 2002; Shepherd, 2023). Based on extrapolation of data from the time frame before immune therapy gained an important role in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, Docetaxel has been chosen for treatment with docetaxel. Doceplatin was given as a second-line treatment after platinum doublet, and is also recommended as second- or third-line therapy after immune therapy and platinum doublets in current practice. This is supported by the relatively good median survival in the docetaxel arm of the CodeBreaK 200 study following chemo-immune therapy in KRASG12c. After the search date for the literature summary (April 2023), at least two relevant RCTs were published comparing immune therapy with docetaxel after previous treatment with immunotherapy. In the phase 3 SAPHIRE study, overall survival for the combination of sitravatinib with nivolumab was not significantly better than for docetaxel (Borghaei, 2023). In the stage 3 CONTACT-01 trial, overall survivability for the atezolizumab combination with cabozantinib was also no better than docetaxel [Neal, 2023). Re-challenge with (chemo-) immune therapy could be considered before starting docetaxel if there was a substantial therapy-free interval without immune therapy for progression occurred and immune therapy stopped due to other reasons than progression. There are too few dates to support a specific time interval. Reported immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) free intervals in the range of 2.4 - 29.4 months. However, there are no randomised studies that show that survival gains occur. Both treatment options are also in accordance with international guidelines (Hendriks, 2023). Professional perspective There are no additional considerations from a professional perspective in addition to the above arguments. Patient perspective Some patients are open to treatments for which no direct evidence is available. It is important for patients to have open communication with their treatment providers and to be fully informed about the benefits and disadvantages of available treatment options. Joint decision-making between patient and caregiver can help to choose treatments that fit the individual situation and preferences of the patient. The patient perspective supports the recommendations. Acceptance, feasibility, implementation The recommendation is already part of the standard treatment at this time. Therefore, the working group does not expect any problems in terms of acceptance, feasibility and implementation. Costs The working group has no final assessment of the means of intervention since this treatment is already a part of standard care. approach in patients with an incurable NSCLC without sensitizing oncogenic driver variants (with PS 0-1 and with no contradictions for ICI). It is recommended to treat the subgroup of patients with PD- L1≥50% with a smoking history with single-agent ICI in the first-line and with ChT (platinum doublet) in the second line. For patients with disease progression after combination ChT and ICI, the recommendations for subsequent treatment are not clear and there is uncertainty about level of evidence for these recommendations. Before the introduction of ICI treatments, docetaxel has shown improved OS compared with best supportive care (BSC) in second line treatment. the introduction of ICI treatment, docetaxel has shown improved OS compared with best supportive care (BSC) in second line treatment.

Search and select A systematic review of the literature was performed to answer the following question: What are the effects of docetaxel compared to best supportive care or other chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without sensitizing oncogenic driver implications after treatment with immunotherapy and platinum doublet (currently or productive)? P: NSCLC patients (adenorcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma) without sensitivity oncogene drivers after treatment with immunotherapy and platinum doublet (constantly or pemetrexed, paclitaxel with bevacizumab); O: overall survival, progress-free survival, response rate, adverse events, quality of life. Relevant outcome measures The guideline development group considered overall survival as a critical outcome measure for decision making; and progress- free survival, respond rate, adverse events and quality of Life as important outcome measures for decisionmaking. A priori, the working group did not define the outcome measures listed above but used the definition used in the studies. A prior, the working group did not define the outcome measures listed above Non small cell lung cancer but used the definitions used in the studies. The working group defined the following minimal clinically (patient) important differences (using the PASKWIL criteria where possible): If mOS in controlgroup ≤12 months: Overall survival: >12 weeks and hazard ratio (HR) <0.7 If mos in control group >12 months; Overall survival; >16 weeks and HR<0.7 Progression-free survival:>16 weeks &lt; 0.7 Response rate: no relevant difference available (only defined by PASKWIL for non-randomized studies) Adverse events: absolute difference <5% for (Methods) The databases Medline (via OVID) and Embase (via Embase.com) were searched with relevant search terms from 2015 until April 17, 2023. The detailed search strategy is defined under the tab Methods. The systematic literature search resulted in 679 hits. Studies were selected based on the following criteria: The study population had to meet the criteria as defined in the PICO; The intervention and comparison had to be defined in English or Dutch. Forty studies were initially based on title and abstract screening. These combinations are not regularly prescribed in the Netherlands.

Treat patients in the second line and further depending on the given TKI in its first line and the found resistance pattern (specific ALK mutation). Considerations Advantages and disadvantages of intervention and quality of evidence The general considerations that apply to all rare mutations are in the main module \"Curable NSCLC' with (rare) mutations \"C'. ALK First line: it has already been shown that ORR and PFS are significantly better with ALk-Tkis (crizotinib rather than ceritinib) than with platinum-containing chemotherapy. The improvement in median PFS is clinically relevant (HR < 0.7 and improvement 16 weeks or more). However, the percentage of grade 3 or higher adverse reactions is similar to ALK -TKIs, the type of side effects is different (mainly biochemical and gastrointestinal for the ALK TKIs and haematological for chemotherapy). Overall survival did not improve in the studies, probably due to the fact that the majority of patients were still treated with an ALK-TKI in later stages. Furthermore, it is important that patients with brain metastases (non-significant) have better outcomes with ALK -TKIs than with chemotherapy (both ORR and PFS). In the first line treatment, both alectinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib and ensartinib (the latter is not available in the Netherlands) and crizotinib are compared with patients with an AlK rearrangement. The improvement in median PFS is clinically relevant (HR < 0.7 and improvement 16 weeks or more) and also due to cerebral penetration of the newer TKIs there is a better control of brain metstatics, or prevention of the emergence of brain metastatics. The newer tKIs are not compared to each other as first line therapy, and at this time it is not clear or first a second generation of ALK TKI Not small cell lung carcinoma followed by lorlatatinib at progression, or direct first line lorlatib. Based on patient characteristics and the toxicity profile, a specific new generation of ALK-TKI in the first line can be chosen.After progression on a second or third generation ALK -TKI can be switched to another ALK (to be selected based on the specific ALK mutation found) or (platinum-doublet) chemotherapy, or study participation. Recommendations The general recommendations for all rare mutations are contained in the main module \"Careable NSCLC\" with (rare) mutations \"Build-up\" Conclusions Overall survival, Adverse events, Quality of Life The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of targed therapy (ensartinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib, alectinib) versus crizotinib on overall survival, objective response rates, adverse events, and quality of Life in patients/alternity.\" objective response rate, adverse events, and quality of life in patients with non-protective cell lung cancer stage IIIB/IV and an ALK fusion. VERY LOW GRADE The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of targeted therapy (crizotinib or ceritinib) versus chemotherapy on overall survival, objective response rates, adverse events,and quality oflife in patientswith non-vulnerable cell cancer stage IVB/iv and an ALF fusion. Objective response rate The evidence has been very uncertain about the effects of targeted theory (ensartinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib, alectinib) vs. crizotatinib on objective response in patients With non-mallcell cancer stage IIB/IVE and an AlK-ffusion. Compare to chemotherapy in patients with non-protective cell lung cancer stage IIIB/IV and an ALK-fusion but the evidence is very uncertain. Progression free survival Targeted therapy (ensartinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib, alectinib) may increase progression free survival compared to crizotinib in patients With non-optical cell cancer stage IIB/iv and an AlK-fusion but the evidence is very uncertain. VERY LOW Targeted theory (crizotatinib or ceritinib) might increase progressionfree survival compared GRADE to chemotherapy in patients WITH non-apparent cell cancer stages IIIB /IV and the evience is quite uncertain. Clinical outcomes after targeted therapy or chemotherapy in NSCLC patients with an ALK fusion was included in this literature analysis. Description of studies Peng (2023) performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of studies to investigate the relative safety and efficacy of all first-line treatments for patients with ALK-positive NSLLC. The literature search covered the period 2013.10.2021. Progression-free survival (PFS), Overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events. The following studies were excluded: Trials in which patients with ALK-positive NSCLC were analysed as a subset, trials of ALK‐ TKIs not as first-line therapy, but as maintenance or neoadjuvant therapy or sequential therapy with chemotherapy or radiotherapy; and trials compare treatments that have not been approved by any Food and Drug Administration. In total, nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. All trials were conceived or designed in cooperation with the industry. Important studies Important study characteristics of the included RCTs are described in table 1. For more details about the included studies, please see Peng (2023).

(Figure In the eXalt3 study, data about the effect of ensartinib versus crizotinib on overall survival maintained immature at data cutoff. In the modified intention to treat (mITT) population, 62 patients died (24.8% in the ensartinib group and 25.4% in the crizo tinib group; HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.54-1.54). This difference was not considered clinically relevant. The 2-year overall survival rate was 78% in both groups. Median interim OS was not achieved in either group. At the end of the study, 92 patients had died (30% in the brigatinib arm and 37% in the crizotinib arm). The 3-year estimated OS rate was 71% (95% CI: 62% In the ALEX study, OS data retained immature with 37% of events recorded (stratified HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46- 0.98). Two studies (PROFILE1029 and PROFILE1014) reported the effect of crizotinib versus chemotherapy on overall survival. In the PROFILE1029 study, 72 patients died 35 (33.7%) in the crizotinib arm and 37 (35.9%) in the chemotherapy arm. Median OS was 28.5 months (95% CI: 26.4% not reached) with crizoTinib and 27.7 months (95% C: 23.9 . cutoff, 48 events occured in the ceritinib group and 59 events in the chemotherapy group, representing 42% of the required events for final OS analysis. The median overall survival was not achieved in the Ceritinib Group (95% CI 29.10.19933 to not estimated) and was 26.10.19932 months (22.10.1998 to not estimate) in the Chemotherapy Group (HR 0.0.73 [95% CI 0.0,75,75,77.5] in theceritinibgroup and 58.2% (47.6,67.5) This difference was not considered clinically relevant. - Important outcome Nine of the nine studies included in the systemic review by Peng (2023) reported on progression free survival (Figure 2). In the eXalt3 study, 119 PFS events occured in the mITT population (62.6% of the 190 anticipated PFS event). The median PFS was not reached in the ENSARTinib group (95% CI, 20.2 months to not achieved) and 12.7 months in the crizotinib group (95 CI%: 8.9-16.6; HR: 0.45 95%CI: 0.30-066; log-rank P < .001). This difference was considered clinically relevant. In the ALTA-1L study, 166 PFS Events occured, of which 73 in the brigatinib arm (53%) and 93 in thecrizotatinib arm (67%). This difference was considered clinically relevant. Blinded independent review showed a 4-year PFS 36% (26% O46%) in the brigatinib arm and 18% (11% O42%) in the crizotinib arm. However, this result was limited by a high rate of censoring and few patients at risk in each group. In the CROWN study, 127 PFS events occured at data cutoff, of which 41 in the lorlatinib group (28%) and 86 in the crizotinib group (59%). Study, 203 patients experienced a PFS event, of which 81 (53.3%) in the alectinib group and 122 (80.8%) in the crizotinib group. Median PFS was 34.8 months (95% CI: 17.7- not evaluated) in the Alectinib Group and 10.9 months (95% C.I.: 9.1-12.9) in the crizotinib group in the alectinib group versus 10·2 months (8·2 .12·0) with crizotinib (HR 0·34 [99·7% CI 0·17 .0·71). The funder decided to release the results immediately, as advised by the independent data monitoring committee. The pooled results of the three RCTS concern alectini versus crizo tinib showed a hazard ratio of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.22 to 0.49) for PFS favoring alectib. This difference was considered clinically relevant. Two studies (PROFILE1029 and PROFILE1014) reported the effect of crizoTinib versus chemotherapy on PFS. In the PROFIL 1029 study, 166 patients experienced a PFS event (77 in the crizotinib arm and 89 treated with chemotherapy). median PFS was 10.9 months (95% CI: 8.3 to 13.9) in the crizotinib group and 7.0 months (95% C.I.: 6.8 to 8.2) in the chemotherapy group. The pooled results of the two RCTS concerning crizoTinib verus chemotherapy showed a hazard ratio of 0.43 (95% C: 0.35 to 0.53) for PFS favoring crizitinib. This difference was considered clinically relevant. In the ASCEND-4 study, middle PFS as assisted by the blinded independent review committe was 16.10.1986 months (95% CA: 12.12.1996-272ff2) in the ceritinib group versus 8.11.199711.71 in the Chemotherapy group (HR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.42; 0.73). response rate (ORR) - Important outcome Nine of the nine studies included in the systemic review by Peng (2023) reported on ORR (Figure 3). The HR for ORR in patients treated with ensartinib, brigatinib, and alectinib compared to patients treated With crizotinib was 1.11 (95% CI: 0.95 to 1.31), 1.18 (95% CI; 0.99 to 1.40), and 1.14 (95% CI): 1.07 to 1.23) respectfully. These differences were not considered clinically relevant. The ORR was higher in patients aged with lorlatinib compared with patients treated to crizo tinib (HR 1.31; 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.55). These differences were considered clinically relevant. Figure 3. Forest plot objective response rate of new generation targeted therapy versus chemotherapy or crizotinib (when compared with next generation TKI) Adverse events (AEs) Grade ≥3 - Important outcome Nine of the nine studies included in the systematic review by Peng (2023) reported on adverse events grade ≥3. Most studies reported a high number of patients with adverse eventsgrade ≥3. The Risk difference for AES grade ≥3 in patients treated with ensartinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib compared to patients aged with crizodinib was 0.08 (-0.04, 0.14, 0.13, 0.24, 0.14, 0.24, and 0.17, 0.28). of grade≥ 3 adverse events was 142 in 380 patients treated with alectinib (37%) and 169 events in 317 patients handled with crizotinib (53%). The pooled risk difference was -0.16 (95% CI: -0.30 to -0.03). This difference was not considered clinically relevant. The risk difference for AES grade ≥3 in patients aged with criZotinib compared to patients treated by chemotherapy was -0.03 (-0.14, 0.08). The risk differential for AEs grade ≥ 3 in patients treated against ceritinib compared with patients treated using chemotherapy Was 0.17 (0.07, 0.26). (QoL) - Important outcome Five of the nine studies included in the systematic review by Peng (2023) reported on quality of life (Qol). In the ALTA-1L study, median time to struggling of GHS/Qol was 26.7 months in the brigatinib arm versus 8.3 months in The crizotinib Arm (HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.49at0.98). The authors also reported that the time to working of emotional and social functioning and symptoms of fatigue, nausea and vomiting, appetite loss, and constitution was significantly delayed by brigatininib. In the CROWN study, mean baseline scores of global quality of Life were 64.6 (SE 1.8) in the orlatinib group and 59.8 (SE 1.20) in the critebit lost, and construction was significantly deposited by brigatinib. The authors state that this difference was not considered clinically meaningful. In the PROFILE1029 study, significantly larger improvement in global QoL scores from baseline was observed in patients in the crizotinib group compared to patients in a chemotherapy group(p < 0.001). Statistically significantly larger improvements were also observed with regard to physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, and cognitive functioning (assised by the QLQC30) and in general health status scores (assessed by the EQ-5D-3L visual analog scale). Differentions in mean changes in overall quality of life score were not reported. In the PROFILE1014 study, Solomon (2014) suggested a greater reduction from baseline in the symptoms of pain, dyspnea, and insomnia (assessed by the QLQ-C30) and in the symptom of dyspNEa, cough, chest pain, arm or shoulder pain, and pain in other parts of the body as measured with the use of the QlQ-LC13 with crizotinib than with chemotherapy. The results, however, were only plotted in a figure. The authors reported that significantly larger improvement in global QoL scores from baseline was observed in patients in the critical group compared to patients in their chemotherapy group. Differences in mean changes in overall quality of life score were not reported. In the Ascend-4 study, lung cancer-specific symptoms and quality oflife measures with the EuroQol (EQ-5D- 5L) were significantly improved for ceritinib versus chemotherapy. No mean quality of Life scores per treatment group were reported; results were only plotted in a figure. In The eXalt3 study, the ALEX study, and the ALESIA study, And the J-ALEX study QoL outcomes were not reviewed.

Low GRADE Sources: Gerber (2018) Summary of literature Two trials that examined clinical outcomes after target therapy in NSCLC patients with a KRACE G12 C related to this literature analysis. Disease progression after previous platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor in a randomized, open-label, phase III study. The study enrolled patients at 148 academic and community centres in 22 countries. In the intervention arm 171 patients received treatment with Sotorasib 960 mg orally once daily. In The control arm 174 patients received Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks. The Study reported the following outcomes: progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), overall response rate, safety, and patient revised outcomes (PROs). The medium duration of follow-up was 17.7 months (IQR 16.4mple201). The study enrolled patients at 11 medical centres in the United States. In the intervention arm patients received erlotinib (150 mg orally daily at least 1 hour prior to and at least 2 hours after intake of food) in combination with tivantinib (360 mg orally twice daily with meals). In the control arm patients received investigator derivatives choice chemotherapy (gemcitabine 1250mg/m2 days 1 and 8 every 21 days, docetaxel 75 mg/m2, day 1 every 21 weeks, or pemetrexed 500 mg/M2 day 1 Every 21 days). The study reported the following outcomes: overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs). De Langen (2023) reported the effect of sotorasib versus docetaxel on OS as secondary endpoint. The study was not powered for OS. Treatment with sotorassib resulting in similar OS compared to treatment with docetaxel (HR 1.01; 95% CI: 0.77 .1.33). This difference was not considered clinically relevant. Median OS was 10.6 months (95% CI 8·9 .14·0) for patients in the sotorashib arm and 11·3 months (95%CI 9·0 .04·9) for patients In the docetaxel arm. Gerber (2018) reported the effects of erlotinib-tivantinib versus chemotherapy on os. Median oS was 6.8 months for patients within the erlot-tivatinib arm and 8.5 months for patient in the chemotherapy arm. The Langen (2023) reported the effect of sotorasib versus docetaxel on PFS. Treatment with sotorosib resulted in a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to treatment with docetaxel (HR 0·66; 95% CI: 0·51 ...0·86). Median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI: 4·3 \"7·8) in the sotorassib arm and 4·5 months (3·0 \"5·7) in the docetaxel arm. The 12-month PFS is 24·8% for sotorashib versus 10·1% for docetaxel. The Langen (2023) reported the effect of sotorasib versus docetaxel on ORR. In patients treated with sotorassib 28.1% (95% CI 21·5/335·4) responded versus 13.2% (95% CI: 8·6,7·19·2) in patients treatedwith docetaxel (p<0·001; difference of propositions of objective response 14·8 (6·4·23·1), NNT=7). This difference was not considered clinically relevant. Gerber (2018) reported the impact of erlotinib-tivantinib versus chemotherapy on OTR. There was no radiographic response in the erlot-tivaentinib group and ORR was 4.4% in the chemotherapy arm. This difference is not considered clinically relevant. Adverse events - Important Two of the two included studies reported on adverse events (AEs). This difference was not considered clinically relevant. The authors stated that, all treatment-related adverse events grade ≥3 of diarrhoea and increased ALT or AST in the sotorasib group resolved after dose interruption, reduction, or both. Gerber (2018) reported the effect of erlotinib-tivantinib versus chemotherapy on AES. Grade ≥3 events occured more frequently in the control arm.

QoL measures were improved Non-small cell lung carcinoma for sotorashib versus Docetaxel for the following outcome: Time to deterioration in global health status (HR 0.69; 95% CI: 0.53/0.91), physical functioning (0.69; 0.520.0.92), and the cancer-related symptoms dyspnea (0.63; 95% CI): 0.48/0.83) and cough (0.55 (0.38/0.80)). The authors state that this difference was considered clinically meaningful. RCTs start at a high level of evidence. Sotorasib versus docetaxel The level of proof for OS, PFS, ORR, and AES and QoL were downgraded with two levels because of risk of bias (no blinding, missing outcome data) and impact (OIS not achieved). Erlotinib-tivantinib versus chemotherapy The levelof evidence for O S, PFs, OSR, and Qol were downgraded with two Levels because of risks of bias and imprecision (OIS not reached).",

ROS 1 First line: there are no randomized studies comparing a ROs1-TKI with chemotherapy. Given the good ORR in phase I (Shaw, 2014) and phase II studies and in prospective series (Mazieres, 2015) of around 70%, with a median PFS of around 10 to 19 months and good tolerability of crizotinib, crizodinib (registered for ROS1) is the first-line treatment preferred. Ceritinib is promising in crizoteinib-naïve ROS1, but is not currently registered. In a phase II study the ORR was around 70% with a minimum PFS from 19.3 months for crizotob naive patients. However, patients who had already been treated with crizotinib did not respond to ceritinib (Lim, 2017). Entrectinib is a newer generation of ROS1 and NTRK TKI. In an updated analysis of three ongoing phase I or II studies, in which 172 patients with ROS2+ NSCLC were included (67 treatment naïve, 2 previously treated with crizotinib), the ORR was 67%, median PFS 16.8 months and median OS was not achieved (Fan, 2023).

WITH dysregulation can be caused by overexpression, amplification, change, exon-14 skipping or generecast. ORRs from around 40 to 50% show up at METexon 14 skipping mutations with TKIs targeting MET, such as crizotinib, capmatinib, and cabozantinib. An example is crizotinib in the PROFILE 1001 WITH exon 14 skipping cohort with an ORR of 44%. Retrospective series show a PFS of around 7 months with crizodinib (Drilon, 2016; Awad, 2017). Tepotinib, a selective c-MET inhibitor, showed an Orr of 45% in a single-arm phase II study in NSCLC patients with a MET exon14 skipping mutation and a median duration of response of 11.1 months, and a mean PFS at 8.9 months (Le, 2022). Capmatinib another selective C-MET inhibitors showed an oRR of 41% in pretreated NS CLC patients who had an exon 14. Skipping mutation, and an ORF of 68% in treatment NSCOL patients (SCL) who have not been able to write captib in the Netherlands. There are few data available on efficacy of immune therapy in METexon14 skipping. It seems that monotherapy immunotherapy is often not effective (reviewed in Remon, 2022).

BRAF v600 targeted therapy has been tested both in the initial line and later. Initially, monotherapy dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor) was tested, in a phase II, non-randomized open label trial involving both previously treated and treatment naive patients. In total, 84 patients were included, of which 6 were in the 1st line. ORR was 67%, ORR in the pretreated patients was 33% (Planchard, Kim, The combination da Brafenib plus trametinib (MEK inhibitor) were also tested. In the firstline (single arm II study with 36 patients) was the ORR 64% with a median PFS of 14.6 months (Plance, 2017). Second line and further: there are no registered BRAF targeted therapies after progression on dabrafenib/trametinib. Options are immune therapy, immunochemotherapy, chemotherapy and participation in studies. If a patient has not received dabraphenib/tranmetinib in the first line treatment, this is a good treatment option based on a single arm phase II study (59 patients) in which an ORR of 63% was found, and a median PFS of 9.7 months (Planchard, Besse, 2016). There is a systematic review plus meta-analysis with respect to treatment of patients with a BRAF mutation (Li 2018). Ten studies were included, of which 9 with a treatment arm with docetaxel or bestsupportive care. An uncontrolled trial evaluated the dabra fenib-trametini combination. The odds ratio to receive an Orr compared to docetaxel was 13.2 (95% CI 5.5 to 33.0) for dabrafefenib plus trametinib versus docetaxel. The estimated HR for PFS and OS relative to docetaxel were 0.32 (95%CI 0.16 to 0.59) and 0.41 (95%CI 0.11 to 1.41). BRAF not V600 There is relatively limited data available, the data available at NSCLC show that targeted therapy is not a good option given the low response rate, short PFS, and O S (Leonetti, 2018).

Considerations Advantages and disadvantages of intervention and quality of evidence The general considerations applicable to all rare mutations are contained in the main module \"Incurable NSCLC treatment with (rare) mutations \" .Uncommon triggering EGFR mutations In the following recitals, the working group follows the considerations of the ESMO guideline (Hendriks, 2023), as far as they apply in the Netherlands. In retrospective studies, first generation EGFR-TKIs provide a lower ORR and PFS in uncommon activation EGFR changes compared to EGFR exon19 deletions of EGFRexon 21 L858R mutations (Passaro, 2021). In an analysis of multiple databases, including a pooled analysis of several Lux-Lung studies involving uncommon EGFR mutation, resulted afatinib and an ORR of 60% and a median time to failure of treatment of 10.8 months (Yang, 2020). Primary endpoint was PFS. Median PFS was 10.6 (afatinib) versus 5.7 months (chemotherapy), with a HR of 0.42 (95% CI 0.26-0.69). In a single arm phase II study, osimertinib resulted in an ORR of 53% and a median PFS of 8.2 months (Cho, 2020). EGFR exon 20 inserts EGFR Exon 20 insertions result in reduced susceptibility to EGFR TKIs and immune therapy. Therefore, until recently, the preferential treatment in the first line of platinum-doublet chemotherapy was treated naive patients with metastatic EGFR EXON 20 insertion mutation NSCLC randomized between mobocertinib and platinum-Doublet chemotherapy. Primary endpoints were PFS; the study was negative, with a medianPFS of 9.6 months for both arms (HR1.04). Bispecific antibody against EGFR and MET has been approved for patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation positive NSCLC pre-treated with platinum-doublet chemotherapy. This approval is based on data from a phase I study (N=81), where ORR was 40% with amivantamab, with a median duration of response of 11.1 months and a median PFS of 8.3 months (Park, 2021). After performing the literature search, the PAPILLON study was published at the end of 2023, a phase III study comparing amivantemab plus platinum-Doublet chemotherapy with platinum doublet chem therapy in treatment naïve patients with metastatic EGFR Exon 20 insert mutation positive to NSCLEC (Zhou, 2023).

      "text": "What should be the composition of a molecular tumor board (MTB) in relation to advice on targeted treatment of lung cancer patients with unusual and/or rare tumor specific genetic changes? How should the MTB be regulated? To which patients should the MTO be restricted and which patients can be introduced to the MTP. Recommendation Composition of molecular tumour board (MTP) In each MTB, at least the following persons should be present to obtain treatment advice from a lung cancer patient: Lungarts with detectable experience with treatment of patients with rare mutations active in one of the NVALT designated treatment centres rare mutations. Long pathologist with experience in diagnostic and predictive testing. Clinical Molecular Biologist in Pathology (KMBP, recognized by NVVP) with broad experience and expertise in various innovative techniques such as NGS, FISH, low-number-detection assaying and RNA based testing, and effective at one of appropriate expertise centers for treatment by NVALT. Medical oncologist with regard to specific knowledge about targeted therapy in malignancies other than lung cancer. Bioinformatician with respect to complex genomic analysis. Apothecary with regard of availability, knowledge about and acquisition of targeted resources. The working group considers it desirable that the different MTB jointly form a nationwide network for: the optimal coordination of methods of work; the exchange of results of treatment advice in relation to rare mutations; archiving results in a national MTB database. Accessibility of the MTB Each treating lung doctor should have access to a (regional) MTB via a fixed point of contact or general address. Which patients bring in to the MT B Limit a treatment advice for targeted therapy to lung cancer patients with: rare or unusual tumor-specific genetic changes that can respond to targeted therapy; unusual molecular findings that can affect target therapy, other than those on the basis of the predisposive medication for which is available. This last terminology is often used in the Netherlands, especially when it comes to an MDO. However, the MTB is the place where rare and unusual molecular changes are discussed (further worked out in \"Thorax\" surgery, radiotherapists and image-makers are involved in the treatment of lung cancer patients. In other countries, such as the USA, an MTB has been described, in which a molecular pathologist with next generation sequencing (NGS) expertise, a geneticist, a phase I researcher and a patient advocative session (Dalton, 2017). In the MTb of the Johns Hopkins institute, an oncologist, a molecular Pathologist, has been identified with next genetic expertise (NGS) is not clear (Harada, 2017; Schwaederle, 2014). In the Netherlands, we do not know the situation with a molecular pathologist, but there is a separate training for a clinical molecular biologist in pathology (KMBP).The KMBP is responsible for the implementation of the predictive and diagnostic tests, as well as the molecular interpretation and reporting of the molecular results Molecular-Diagnostic-2021_def.pdf; In The Netherlands, a proposal has recently been made for participants in an MTB for the Dutch situation (van der Velden, 2017). In particular, it is based on a MTB relating to results in which whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genomous sequating (WGS) data is used. That is the reason that at least an oncologist, hematologist, or lung-oncologist, a (moleculair) pathologist, a MTBO has been used mainly in relation to the use of this type of genetic engineering. In general, only diagnostic and predictive tumor-specific genetic changes for which targeted therapy is available (Schuuring, 2017; Niemantshriet, 2018; Meedendorp, 2018) are discussed. Therefore, the role of a bioinformatician is currently limited in the eyes of the working group. The opinion is that an MTB should have the possibility to request expertise from a bioInformaticist, but that formal seat in the MTB is not an obligation. A clinical (molecular) geneticist is also not necessary in the current MTB because in the present molecular diagnostics on lung tumor tissue should not be tested. Because some commercial mutation panels contain this information and it is possible that molecular results can be obtained with hereditary consequences, the working party considers that anMTB should be able to request the expertise of a clinical (moleculair) genetician to arrive at a proper treatment advice. However, in the Netherlands there is no need for a medical oncologist to be present, but in practice it will be part of a broader MTB, where there is also no lung-oncology case discussed. However, an MTB should have the possibility to ask for expertise from a medical Oncologist, among other things, regarding specific knowledge about targeted therapy in malignancies other than lung cancer. Since the casuism will concern in particular rare or unknown tumor-specific genetic changes (further elaborated in •Which patients will introduce to the MTB?) expertise is required of lung oncologists working daily with rare mutations. The same applies to the KMBP and lung pathologist. A new development in the field of predicting response to target-oriented therapy for unknown mutations or combinations of mutations in the same protein, in particular for which no data and literature is available, is the use of bindingaffinit calculations of available targeted substances using virtual 3D models of •mutated • protein structures. However, an MTB should be able to ask for expertise from a structural biologist but this expertise is not currently considered necessary for any MTB. The expertise of a pharmacist can sometimes be used to optimally regulate medication in compassionate use or off-label use. This person does not need to be present at the MTB by default, because the pharmacist can be especially involved after an advice from the MT B. All of the above makes that the working group considers that in an MTb in which a treatment advice from a lung cancer patient is discussed at least a pulmonary doctor, a bioinformatician, a structural biologists and a pharmacist, all three are employed in a centre of expertise for rare mutations concerning the treatment of lung cancer, should be present. Expertise should be relied upon from a geneticist, a medical oncologist, a biinformaticsist, and a chemist. Accessibility of MTB with regard to the accessibility of MT B is stated that every lung doctor should have access to a MTB in the region. The MTB is responsible for ensuring the feedback of the decision to the treating lung doctor. An advice should be returned within a reasonable period (7 to 14 days) after asking the question. Which patients bring in to the MTB? Predictive and diagnostic molecular pathology has become an important part of the diagnosis of lung cancer patients. As described in module \"Predictive Tests\" from among others this Directive, there are currently several predictive and diagnostic biomarkers that have a direct consequence for a choice of targeted lung cancer therapy (see also Lindeman, 2018; Garinet, 2018). Overall, this concerns only a small number of predictive biomarkerrs who are relatively frequent (average >5%) in late-stage NSCLC (for example EGFR-exon19del, EGFR.(L858R) and KRAS-codon12/13 mutations). profile is made of larger series of tumor biopsies of lung cancer patients, that new genetic changes in other genes or active domains of already known predictive markers (m.n. kinase domains) are present. These studies show that in advanced stages NSCLC many potential new markers are observed but in almost all cases a frequency of <1% (Tsao, 2016; Garinet, 2018; Jordan, 2017; CGARN, 2014; Barlesi, 2016); CLCGP, 2013). Despite the fact that this group of biomarkers could be excellent targets for targeted therapy, in most cases in the short term insufficient data from clinical studies will be available in view of the very small numbers of patients with these rare mutations on the basis of which we could determine a consensus response to any therapy. Parallelly, the pharmaceutical industry reports on new drugs aimed at a very wide range of specific genetic changes or against tumour-specific activated pathways to lung cancer, which may not be limited in any individual case. In addition, there are more and more targeted agents available against genetic changes in the same gene mutation hotspots such as for example 5 drugs directed against mutations in codon 1151 to 1268 in ALK associated with ALK-TKI resistance (Gainor, 2016; Yoda, 2018) and dozens of anti-EGFR-TCI (next to erlotinib, gefintib, afatinib and osimertinib) for the 3 mutation hot spots (G719x, exon19del and L858R) (Ohashi, 2013; Loong, 2018). Without explicit knowledge, this information is unusable and we remember a very serious possibility of optimal therapy with good response and low adverse reaction versus palliative standard therapy, a task that should be explicitly the task of the MTB. Without explicit knowledge, this information is also unusable and we deny lung cancer patients a very serious possibility of an optimal therapy with good response and minor adverse reaction versus palliative standard therapy, a task that should be explicitly the task of the MTB. By using biological knowledge and experience on functional domains, scientific clinical studies, in vitro studies, 3D modeling and protein-drug binding studies or by searching available databases such as google, cosmic, mycancergenome, ClinVar, cBioPortal, OncoKB and many others (Deans, 2017; Cree, 2013; Li, 2017), the MTb experts in common consultation determine whether there are sufficient data in direct relationship with the clinical condition and status of therapy to date from the patient concerned to deviate from pallial (non curative) standard chemotherapy. The group therefore considers that the discussion of a treatment advice for targeted therapy should be limited to the following lung cancer patients: a. Patients with rare or unknown tumour-specific genetic changes (<1%) other than the mutation hotspots of the predictive markers mentioned in this Directive. For example, EGFR mutations outside the 3 mutation hot spots (G719x, exon19del and L858R) which together ~85% of all mutations in exon 18-21 of EGFR gene encoding for the active tyrosine-kinase domain, cover. In the other 15% of NSCAC, >3000 other different mutations are found with a frequency of <0.1% and some only <1% (data of cosmic database). b. Patients who have rare or unfamiliar tumor-specific gene changes (<1%) in combination with a change in the active tyrosin-kinase domain, which is not known under this criterion are known under the EC. Other than described under (a) is currently unknown as the effect of this secondary unknown EGFR mutation on standard EGFR-TKI therapy due to a therapy-sensitive mutation in EGFR hotspot region. Apart from T790M as the known resistance mechanism in particular erlotinib and gefitinib (the first available EGFR -TKI) (Loong 2018) there is little known about many >3000 different EGFR mutations. Currently, more and more EGFR TKI are used whose effects and resistance mechanisms are not yet known at all. c. Patients with unusual or unknown (combinations of) molecular genetic changes (generally <1%) known to be predictive or diagnostic in malignancies other than lung cancers. In other malignancies, clinical-relevant predictive molecular biomarkers are often combined with highly effective therapy (whether or not registered/off-label) as described in melanoma (BRAF-mutation other than V600E), colorectal carcinoma (NRAS), GIST (KIT-PDGFRA-NECHOL) and cerebral agent (s) in combination with highly efficient or non-targeted cell (s). Patients with rare resistance mechanisms (with known and unknown mutations) in tissue biopsies or cell-free plasma during clinical progression on (targeted) therapy. Such resistance mechanisms are currently not known and often show unknown genetic changes where the approach is the usual route as described in b-c. In addition, more and more different targeted agents are becoming available against genetic changes in the same gene mutation hotspots such as >5 anti-resistance mutations in ALK (Gainor, 2016; Yoda, 2018). In this way, 3D-modeling of mutated proteins and virtual binding of available target drugs is increasingly being used. e. Patients with a NSCLC with mutation tumor heterogeneity. By predictive testing of different parts of the same tumor biopt, testing of various tumours from different locations or parallel testing of plasma DNA also becomes visible in lung cancer heterogeneticity. f. Patients who have a genetic change known as a (possible) germ mutation. Talking about options in case of too few neoplastic cells in relation to the use of alternative high-sensitivity tests or other materials such as plasma, urine or CSF. Talk about options when misunderstood response to targeted therapy Talk about tests carried out in the context of research and show results that may influence standard therapy choice Underbuilding Background By using multiple (possibly) predictive tumour markers as well as by increasing the number of patients with stage IV lung carcinoma (especially in the adenocarcinoma) tested, rare or unknown tumour-specific genetic changes (<1%) or combinations are increasingly observed in the current molecular diagnostics. In these cases, no direct guidance is available in a directive and literature is to a limited extent for hands. Because for the assessment of such findings a specific expertise is required, other than in the usual patient discussions in the MDO (multidisciplinary consultation), so-called Molecular Tumor Boards (MTB) are established. This chapter, since the clinical questions presented in this chapter could not be answered by literature but by consensus of the working group.

References Starting question Which radiation schedule is preferred for palliative radiotherapy for thoracic complaints in patients with NSCLC? Recommendation In patients in good overall condition with thoracic complaints due to lung cancer can be considered (in consultation with the patient) a higher radiation dose (at least 30 Gy in 10 fractions) because a higher dose may have a better effect on the overall symptom burden and leads to better 1 year survival than a dose of <30 Gy. In patients who have poor overall condition due to thoracic complaints caused by lung cancer. Considerations Field size and techniques used: Almost all studies used two-dimensional techniques and opponent fields (AP-PA) (except Nestle 2000: AP-PA up to 40Gy, then sloping fields up to 60Gy) where field sizes were often limited to 200cm2. Increasing individualised options for palliative systemic therapy (chemotherapy, biologically targeted agents and immunotherapy) at stage IV, which were generally not available at the time of these studies, could have an impact on the effects of and indication for palliative radiation. If a good effect of systemic therapy could be sufficient; but also: in the event of a good impact of systemic therapies, a higher dose of radiotherapy could further improve the outcome. There is no evidence available. In a poor performance status, symptom palliation is at the forefront and deserve short schedule dressings.Underbuilding Background Because most patients with metastatic lung carcinoma still die from their disease, Not small cell lung carcinoma often raises the demand for optimal pallisation of symptoms due to intra-thoracic tumor (such as cough, dyspnoea, pain, haemoptoesis). Radiotherapy plays an important role in this. Lighting of symptoms is obtained in 70- 80% of patients, with few side effects. Significant toxicity occurs in less than 5% of patients: pneumonitis in 2-3%, nausea and vomiting and severe oesophagitis in less then 1%. In more than half of patients the complaint for which radiotherapy was given is life-long remains under control. There is evidence of very low quality that palliative radiotherapy with a dose of at least 30 Gy has no significantly better effect on thoracic pain than a dose <30 Gy. There is proof of very poor quality that palmiative radiation therapy at a dose at least 30% Gy has a significantly better impact on the overall symptom burden than a <30 Gh dose. However, this does not apply to the 2 year survival. Evidence that palliative radiotreatment with a low dose of 30 Gy produces significantly less dysphagia due to radiation esophagitis than palliative radiotherapy at higher doses. Over the duration of the response of pallliative Radiotherapy can not be concluded on the basis of the available evidence of high quality. Summary of literature Literature description (December 2014) Three systematic reviews compared to radiotherapy schedule with a retreading dose versus a palliitive radiation therapy with a higher dose of 2 mg. The most complete reviews are those of Lester et al. (14 randomised studies) and Fairchild et al (13 randomized studies). Only Fairchild and al. performed a meta-analysis, but the radiotherapy dose was very heterogeneous, both in the group with a textured dose (10-40 Gy) and with a high pharmacodynamic dose (17-60 Gy) (Table 1). N.B.: when we talk about dose in this module, we always mean the physical dose. However, the most recent review of Ma et al included only studies that included a dose of <30 Gy compared to a dose at least 30 Gy, and therefore best suited to the baseline question. Ma et all. included five randomised studies published before June 2013. In most of these studies, patients with tumour stages < IV (i.e. IIIA/B) were also included, and one study with SCLC. It should be noted that Ma et et all the results of the 1-year studies of one of the five studies [K The original publication [3] was not modified. This module (description effects, conclusions) included the correction. Our literature search identified one more recent randomised study [6]. Sau et al. randomized 156 patients with stage IV NSCLC to palliative radiotherapy up to a dose of 17 Gy (2 x 8.5 Gy in 2 weeks), 20 Gy (5 x 4 Gy in 1 week) or 30 Gy (10 x 3 Gy in 2-week). Table 1.

Ma et al. searched only in Medline and Google Scholar, but our literature search confirms that they may not have missed a study [3]. Maet al. conducted a meta-analysis. No study included a blinding of patients, treatment and/or effect assessors, and only one study reported an allocation concealment. For further assessment of the effects of high versus low dose radiotherapy, the two meta-analyses of Fairchild and Ma are further discussed below. Sau et al's randomised study has not reported a significant difference in the effect on coughing between high dose (at least 30 Gy) and low dose (<30 Gy) radiotherapy (odds ratio 0,88; 95%CI 0.71-1.08) [3].Fairchild et al did not find any significant difference between lower and higher doses of pallitive radiation: critical outcome Coughes Ma et all. reported no significant difference on cough levels of high dose (1,0 Gy) or low dose (odds ratio 0,88, 95%CI 0,71,08). Dyspnoea Dyspnoee was not explicitly analysed in the meta-analysis, but included under general symptom burden. Thoracic pain Ma et al. reported no significant difference in the effect on thoracic pain between high dose (at least Baseline Question • What information should be given to patients with NSCLC on diagnostics? • Which information must be given about lung cancer as an occupational disease? ■ What information must we discuss with patients with nsCLC about treatment? ~ What information about contact with fellow patients with the NS Recommendation Understandable information Give information in the form of short, simple sentences if possible supported by image information if necessary, to the patient's health skills. Diagnostic Talk with the patient: • what diagnostic tests/ interventions are needed to arrive at a diagnosis. Is there any suspicion of exposure to asbestos, advise patients on the scheme Meeting Substances-related Occupational Diseases (TSB) and refer them to the Institute Victims Occupational Sickness Dangerous Substances (ISBG).The ISBG collects data and evaluates whether patients may qualify for the regime After registration they carry out further research into the possible exposure in the past: Treatment Discuss the treatment possibilities and impact on the quality of life and survival with the pat under which the option cannot be treated.In addition to medically-material, also psychosocial support and information about the life sign SCLC? gene.Also adjust the that there is no one and by eling TSO. tient, nde. To indicate a fixed point of contact for the patient throughout the treatment pathway and discuss this with the patient.Allowly indicate how and when this person is to be reached and who is absent. For patients information can be referred to cancer.nl and lung cancernederland.nl (see, among other things, the website with important questions).Information provision In the information to the patient, the treatment provider informs which tests, imaging and invasive procedures are necessary to arrive at a diagnosis and a treatment plan.The accessibility of lung tumours may be difficult so that multiple tests or interventions are necessary in order to obtain sufficient information for the most rational treatment.A bad news conversation/ result interview is preferably conducted personally instead of telephone, digital or via a care robot.Bad news interview There must be a reasonable possibility that a patient after a poor news call/result conversation is taken up by, for example, a nursing consultant.With great preference treatment options are not only discussed during the bad new's conversation and no definitive treatment choice is made during this conversation.If possible, a different time is planned. Not every patient has the same health skills and is in condition to process all complex information in the emotional and violent period of lung cancer and treatment. In such cases, it is desirable to provide more extensive information, digitally or on paper. Inform the general practitioner with further medical information about the patient and possibly about care provided from the hospital. Diagnostic trajectory and waiting time What is essential in providing information on the diagnostic pathway are the expectations in terms of duration of the examinations and therefore what the expected waiting time is for a diagnosis to be made. In addition, it should be made clear that pathology diagnostics are of importance for the treatment and that (especially at stage IIIB-IV) molecular diagnostics should generally be awaited. Times of this are not always clear for patients, but also for caregivers, as shown by the bottlenecks inventory and focus group of patients. It is therefore preferable to make this possible to communicate as easily as possible and to the patient. Here it is also possible for patients Not small lung carcinoma is often clear that further tests are to be performed. For information and informed consent to molecular tumor diagnosis, a directive has been developed (for authorisation, publication expected mid-2023) on the initiative of the Association of Clinical Genetics Netherlands (VKGN) with the support of the Netherlands Association for Pathology (NVVP).Long cancer due to work Occupational exposure to carcinogenic substances is responsible for about 15% of all tumours of the entire airways in men and 5% in women. Lung cancer is most common (Gibson, 2013). Various chemicals have been identified that in occupational exposure give an increased risk to lung cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has 31 substances, exposures or work processes indicated as category 1 carcinogens, which means that these substances are carcinogenic to humans (Iarch, 2021).For the substances asbestos, silica, diesel emission, chromium, arsenic, berillium and cadmium are known (Loomis, 2018). Since the 1993 asbestos ban, asbestos exposure to various types of asbestos has been applied in the past.The Health Council (2010) makes no distinction in the risk of lung cancer caused by exposure to different kinds of asbestos (Health Council, 2010).In the diagnosis of lung lung cancer, it is not yet possible to distinguish from the medical diagnostics on the basis of clinical, radiological or enzymatic characteristics whether lung cancer was caused by asbestos exposure.However, the localisation of malignancy in the lungs as well as the type of malignance are not distinguishable.The presence of so-called feline bridge diagnoses such as asbestososis and/or the presence of pleural plaques or pleural thickening can support the diagnosis.In particular, the historical working history of the lung cancer will have to indicate a possible work-related cause. In the future, workers with other occupational diseases by dangerous substances will also be eligible for compensation.For more information, see the ISBG website: The procedure for applying for and granting of treatment follows a number of steps involving different organisations: the Institute for Victims Occupational Diseases by Dangerous Substances (ISBG) which collects the necessary data, the Expert Panel assessing whether the recognised occupational disease is present and the Social Insurance Bank (SVR) receiving the application takes a decision and makes any payment.For further information see the website of the ISBV: Who is eligible for the TSO scheme? To be eligible under this one-off benefit, there must be the following: 1. A confirmed medical diagnosis of primary lung cancer has been established. 2. There must have been a substantial contribution of asbestos exposure during the working life (in paid and/or as ZZP The patient's diagnosis and extension of the disease should be discussed with the patient. The various therapeutic possibilities with the expected results and possible side effects should be explained. Also, the possible effects on the quality of life of the patient are discussed. The conclusions of the multidisciplinary consultation with the lung/thorax surgeon, radiotherapist and other specialists should be reviewed and, if relevant, the results of the molecular tumor board, so that, prior to an initiated treatment, it is clear to everyone what the follow-up path is and to where treatment may be possible. Also many common complications should be considered or made known via information forms. In addition to the policy proposed by the treatment team, real alternatives are also discussed. Examples of this are supportive care as an alternative to systemic treatment, no follow-on treatment as an alternate to adjuvant treatment Non-small lung carcinoma and SABR or wigressection. On this basis, the patient decides to go along with the treatment proposal or not. This can be a lung doctor, pulmonary doctor in training, basic doctor, nurse, nurse consultant/specialist, physician assistant or case manager. In addition to contacting the treated specialist, it is important for the patient to have a permanent nursing point that is easily accessible. What can be said about contacting fellow patients with NSCLC? Fate contact can be an important source of information and support for patients. In various group interventions for patients with cancer, contact with fellow patients is perceived as supportive, especially by the recognition and recognition of feelings and experiences (Grol, 2001; Vos, 2001, Borne, 1983). Not all patients need lottery contact. Some patients avoid meeting with fellow sufferers to be confronted with the suffering of others. Also the large process in the association for patients who have lung cancer, resulting from the limited life expectancy, can be (to be) confrontable. Patients with lung cancer can come into contact with other patients via Longcancer Netherlands. The patient is advised by preference. The patients can then decide whether they need to be given a background if they are not to be aware of any particular reason. Patients find it difficult to wait, especially when they don't know what to do. Therefore, it is important that patients know what they are doing. An additional difficulty is that the period around the diagnosis is spiritually difficult for patients and relatives and the communication about it is different from that of the differences in coping styles and health skills between patients. Furthermore, it's necessary to give information dosed and to ensure that the patient receives for him understandable information. Consider visual support through animations and videos. In addition, patients see information about treatment and (psychosocial) aftercare as bottlenecks in the pathway after diagnosis. Search and select Search and Select No systematic literature analysis was performed for this chapter, since the clinical questions presented in this chapter were not answered by literature.

Considerations There are no considerations described. Underbuilding summary literature About the most adequate file handling of patients with nsCLC is not done. The paper or digital medical file should contain all relevant information necessary for adequate medical care. It concerns data obtained from history, physical examination, additional research, data from other medical events, data on the policies to be conducted and what has been discussed with the patient, treatment and follow-up. The file is not only important for the treatment during the patient's contact, but it is also the starting point for consultation with other specialists and for observation in service. If it concerns a patient with a newly discovered lung carcinoma or a suspicion thereof, then there is essentially no distinction in data relating to the tumor, such as type and stage. Also, the findings that concern the patient himself and, among other things, indicate what treatment he or she may be (functional examination) and wants to undergo. On how the file should look exactly, there are no scientific data available, but the above considerations are common in medical training and practice. In this chapter it is inventarized what can be recorded in the file of patients with lung cancer, based on what is necessary in practice. Much of the information below may be irrelevant to the individual patient, but most textbooks sum up varying data that are relevant to the lung cancer patient in general. Anamnese The history focuses on complaints that indicate enlargement and metastasis of the tumour, and on data on the operability of the patient. Frequent complaints when presenting are coughing, thoracic pain, shortness of breath or haemoptoe. In case of weight loss, bone pains, swelling, complaints in upper abdomen and flanks, and neurological symptoms should be additional examination of metastasization not small cell lung carcinoma. In the case of lung cancer indications, the main risk factor for developing lung malignancy and COPD (1) is found to be found. The number of felinepackyears is often calculated and recorded in the status. Also, an indication of the general condition of the patients and the presence of co-invalidity is found in American studies. In American studies it was found that co-morbidity is an independent prognostic factor (2) (3) (4) (5). Weight loss and poor performance'-score are associated with more extensive disease and a worse prognosis (6). The following subjects can be recorded in the medical file: age; gender; tumour complaints (cough, altered cough pattern, haemoptoe, pain, dyspnoea); complaints that may indicate lymph node swelling; complaints that can indicate metastases (liver pain, bone pain, headache, neurological symptoms); symptoms that may be indicative of paraneoplastic syndrome, and therefore indicate the type of carcinoma, or require special treatment (olanzapine' ADH secretion, hypercalcaemia by increased parathion activity, hypertrophic osteoarthritis and other syndromes); signs that indicate a worse diagnosis (fatigue, poor appetite, weight loss in the previous three months); duration of the complaints; smoking (number of packyears); co-sorbidness; social network. The measurement of blood pressure, auscultation of the heart and assessment of vascular status are important in relation to the assessment of the operating risk.The following subjects should be recorded in the medical file: length (in cm); weight (in kg); general impression, clinical condition, enoate performance'-score (Karnofsky/WHO), see table (8) (9) circulation: pulse, blood pressure; abnormal vene drawing (vena cava superior syndrome) lymph node stations; abnormal lung and liver findings; orientation neurological examination (horner syndrome); presence of any paraneoplastic syndrome (see above).Table Level of functioning according to corresponding  performance'- score according to WHO and according to Karnofsky WHO score Meanings Karnoffsky score 0 Fully active, capable of normal activity without 90-100 restrictions 1 Limited in performing heavy activity, but capable of carrying out light work 2 In condition of self, but not capable of 50-60 working, more than 50% of the time that the person is awake, is this mobile 3 In condition to bed by more than 50-40; capable of handling the person being fully dependent on the Whether this will be replaced in the near future by a low dose CT is still unclear. In many cases it has already been made (this was the reason for the suspicion of lung cancer). In principle, both a forward and lateral uptake is recommended in most directives. Recommendations related to the urbanization study are already made in the module Diagnostics. Pathological research is indicated for confirming the diagnosis, determining the monoclonal subtype and for determining the various mutations in different phosphonate drivers' proteins. The lung function should be mapped out to estimate the possible surgery and/or radiation risk. Little is known about the value of laboratory research. Electrolyte determinations are important for possible paraneoplastic syndromes, liver enzyme values due to possible evidence of liver metastases and an increased activity of alkaline phosphatase may indicate bone metastasis. Electrolyte tests are important for possible paraneoplastic syndromes, liver enzyme values due to possible evidence of liver metastases and increased activity of alkaline phosphatase may indicate bone metastasis. The following studies should be performed to determine whether they were performed and the original results should be included in the electronic (or paper) dossier: X-ray; Bronchoscopy; CT; mediastinaloscopy (also the number of glands studied and the localisation of these glands); FDG-PET or FDG -PET-CT; MRI; PA-study; Laboratory examination; Examination of any paraneoplastical syndrome (see above); pulmonary function examination (forced expiratory 1-second value (FEV), total lung capacity (TLCO), Non-small cell lung carcinoma vital capacity (VC)); Treatment of the patient's treatment, should be recorded in the medical file: date of surgery; date of the surgery; initiation of the dose of the therapy; and end of the dosage of chemotherapy; Follow-up As regards follow-up, the following items should be recorded in the file: date and place of recurrence or progression; date of death; cause of death.

Starting question What is the role of prevalence of psychosocial problems in patients with NSCLC? Recommendation Based on the prevalence of Psychosocial problems among patients with lung cancer should be questioned by any patient with lung disease. The differences in percentages can be explained by the use of different measuring instruments and the selection of the research group. Support Conclusions About one third of patients with lung cancer have psychosocial problems. Level 3: C Schrameijer 1992 (4), Sarna 1998 (1), Zabora 2001 (3), Hopwood 2000 (2) Physical symptoms, such as shortness of breath, cough, pain, fatigue and anorexia, are a major cause of psychosocial issues in lung cancer patients. Level 3 C Sarna1998 (1) Summary of literature In a literature review on psychosocial morbidity in lung lung cancer subjects (1998), there were high prevalences of anxiety (17-33%) and depressive moods (11-33%) (1). In a study conducted in 2000, 21% of patients were in need of additional help with NSCLC anxiety and 25% depression (2). A comparison of 14 different patient groups in 2001 showed that psychosocial difficulties were most common in patients with cancer (3).",

Nurses play an important supporting role in this process.The nurse counseling during treatment should focus on monitoring and managing emotional and physical problems.Health care workers should be familiar with measuring quality of life and be willing to use measuring instruments. Regular measurement of the quality of living by an oncology nurse or nurse practicer can provide additional information to determine the choice of treatment.Oncology nurses could pay more attention to mapping the quality in life in lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Considerations Involvement and emotional support are part of the basic care process of medical and nursing care providers.This support softens problems such as anxiety and depression, improves the collaboration between the physician and patient and promotes the information processing of patients. Attention for emotions and well-being facilitates the treatment process of the disease and treatment. Nurses can be emotional or psychological problems low-thressed and adequately discuss with patients; however, the above literature describes summary and limited concerns (fearth and distress). Stopping smoking can lead to the same symptom even for patients with extensive illness, physical and psychological benefits. For support for cessation of smoking, reference can be made to the 2004 CBO's tobacco addiction treatment directive (17). Support Conclusions There is a need for healthcare professionals who provide emotional support and who respond to the psychosocial need of patients, by inviting patients to talk about their concerns and try to address the concerns at an early stage of disease. Level 3: C Hill 2003 (2) The patient's age and quality of life before treatment predict the degree of improvement in Non-small cell lung carcinoma quality of living after chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Level 3 C Bozcuk 2006 (5); Biesma 2011 (15) Nurses can provide an active role in supporting the learning of new skills (coping skills) to patients and family members, who promote the sense of competence, control and support and reduce physical and emotional distress. Level 4: C Ryan 1996 (10) Early assessment of symptoms and symptom management by (oncology) Health professionals can improve their quality of health and health care in order to improve their ability. 2008 (16) Follow-up by nurses with a focus on information provision, support and coordination of care, can lead to the same or better patient satisfaction and symptom control compared to follow-up given by a doctor. Level 3: C Thompson 2005 (8) Summary literature Role of the nurse in detecting psychosocial problems Disease and treatment not only give physical complaints, but also include anxiety, uncertainty, gloom, despair and impairment of self-esteem and control, shame and guilt, especially when the patient smokes. In addition, there are many social consequences such as when the patients become lonely and/or dependent. The confrontation with cancer may lead to an existential crisis. It raises questions regarding what is meaningful and significant for the patient (1). Research by Hill in 2003 shows that lung cancer patients (n=80) find that less than half of their concerns (43%) in the treatment team are discussed shortly after the diagnosis (14-28 days) (2). Patients with more concerned about the psychosocial consequences of the disease than about the physical problems. In women with NSCLC, its young age, depressed mood, number of comorbid diseases and a negative significance to the disease, related to a lower quality of life (4) In addition to the fact that chemotherapy at NS CLC is associated with improving quality of living and palliation of symptoms, there are a number of other factors that also affect quality of Life. Thus, Bozcuk describes in 50 patients that the quality of lives prior to chemotherapy treatment, the type of chemotherapy, and the patient's age determine the extent of life during treatment with chemotherapy (5). Emotional support is needed when discussing sexual feelings. In a prospective, descriptive study (n=59) it has been examined that many sexual functioning is reduced at the start of treatment and that may not respond to that treatment (7). The timely recognition of problems during the course of disease due to cancer and due to subsequent treatment (6). For the detection of mental stress in cancer patients, it is strongly recommended to use the last meter. This consists of the thermometer and the problem list as described in the directive detect the need for psychosocial care. Role of the nurse in symptom management Oncology nurses can recognise symptoms and manage, inform and provide supportive care. This can take place in collaboration with other disciplines involved in the care and treatment of the most common complaints in patients with lung cancer (8). Supportive care can affect the emotional and psychological condition of the patient, but also on physical symptoms, such as dyspnoea management. The supportive care in the Thompson study was focused on the understanding of patients in their disease, expressing their feelings about symptoms, diagnosis and future and expanding self-management (8). Patients can benefit from short-term interventions aimed at managing short-breathness, nutrition, movement, increasing the sense of relaxation and retention of family relations (9). Ryan describes in her review article the proven effects of behavioural interventions of various patients with cancer such as pain, dyspnea and vomiting through chemotherapy (10). In a randomized study (n=471) Sikorskii describes the value of automatic telephone symptom management compared to telephone symptom control by a nurse (11). Both interventions show a clinically significant reduction in the severity of symptoms. It was striking that patients with lung cancer who have more severe side effects withdrew from the automatic telephone contacts, probably because telephone intervention does not adequately provide adequate symptom management. Nevertheless Cox describes that symptom management by phone could be a good complement to outpatient follow-up (12). Nurse's role in follow- up Although there is little research available, follow-ups in lung cancer patients seem important, regardless of the stage and treatment the patient undergoes. Information and guidance require a systematic approach of follow-on, for each patient should also be a personal after-care plan. For patients with advanced disease, where treatment options are limited, there are less obvious followup guidelines. In particular symptom control (medical control) and psychical support is important. In a study of Cox in a selected group of 54 patients visiting lung cancer clinics, there should be a following-up plan for patients who have been able to treat patients with an advanced disease and have a better option of being able to deal of treatment. Although work for many cancer patients can be an important source of emotional support and financial independence, many cancer sufferers experience problems with work resumption.The 2009 Cancer and Work Directive provides further information (13).For lung cancer patients treated in a curative design, problems may arise longer after the end of treatment and therefore a programmatic approach to aftercare as indicated by the Cancer Recovery Directive seems desirable (14).In the course of their treatment, the nurse's role in the coordination of care will be made with many healthcare providers.The complexity of the care is increasing and therefore, a window or a point of contact is essential to avoid getting lost as a patient in the care clinic.A case manager is needed to ensure continuity.The (oncology) nurses, nursing specialists or  realiser-practicers' can fulfil this role of case managers.They coordinate the logistics surrounding the treatment plan, his contact for multidisciplinary teams and/or accompany clinical scientific research. Continuity of care may be better supplied by nurses than by doctors, because of the often smaller group of nurses with less response in the team.

What is the role of the various disciplines for the psychosocial oncological care of patients with NSCLC, from the time of diagnosis to the moment of death? Recommendation Family doctor, medical specialist and (oncology) nurse should be aware that basic psychosocial care should be provided from the beginning of diagnosis and treatment of NS CLC. This care consists of tailored information, adequate treatment and, if necessary, timely referral. For good psychosocial treatment, adequate reference should be available to psychosocially oncologically trained healthcare providers such as nursing specialists, (hospital-related) social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists, and/or to specific patient programs (interview groups, relaxation groups, rehabilitation programmes, patient association).Recitations Evidence-based'-research on the organisation of care is lacking. The organization of psychosocial Oncological care in the Netherlands falls within the framework of general health care and is bound to the financial choices of the health care insurers. Underbuilding Conclusions Doctors and nurses play an important role in psychosocial care for patients, by providing good information about disease and treatment, adequate treatment and signalling of serious problems. Level 3: C Schrameijer 1992 (1) Specialized psychosocial health care providers (social work, psychologists, psychiatrists, mental caregivers) have a role when the basic psychosocial treatment of medical care providers is not sufficient. Level 3: C Schrameijer (1) Summary of literature For adequate guidance, a good coordination between the various treatment providers involved is indispensable from the time of diagnosis to the moment of death of great importance. Good communication, Not small cell lung carcinoma multidisciplinary consultation and transfers, both during hospitalisation and transfers from the second to the first line, are in all stages of diagnosis and treatment. Psychosocial-oncological care is provided by all professionals with whom the patient in the oncological treatment process is involved. Many disciplines are involved in the psychosocial attention for patients with cancer, and their duties depend on the expertise and the position of the treatment process (2). Such as general practitioner, pulmonary doctor, oncologist, (cardiothoracic) surgeon, radiotherapist and (oncology) nurse, provide guidance and emotional support during the contacts within the primary medical treatment. Information about the disease and the treatment to be tailored are the pillars of this guidance. In tailor-made information it is to help the patient in decision-making, to advise on living rules and to reassure by removing misunderstandings; this has improved self-care, increased acceptance of the disease, and less anxiety and uncertainty. (2) When the patient needs general information about lung cancer, reference can be made to the website of the Long Cancer Information Centre. Guidance at this level is offered if the disease and the treatment threaten to become too heavy for the patient. This care may consist of counseling, psycho-education, psychotherapy and/or medical therapy (2).

Not small cell lung carcinoma - TNM classification Baseline question How should the disease stage of non-small cell lung cancer be classified? Recommendation Use the 8th edition of the TN M classification for the determination of the stage of disease of non small cell pulmonary carcinoma. Use an elastin staining when determining pleurain invasion. Considerations The TNm classification and stage classification is based on the prognostic significance of tumor characteristics of patients with lung cancer and not on therapy. In recent years, the database of lung cancer patients has been redefined, with a more proportional inclusion of patients around the world. Based on the current database of 94.708 patients (Rami-Porta, 2015 and Goldstraw, 2015) the T and M factor have been re-defined and a new distribution is made on the basis of survival rates. This is the 8nd edition of TN m classification. The changes between the older and the most recent classification are described. T-status Due to the differences in survival, when a difference is made in size per centimeter of 2 cm. The prognosis of tumours > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm is equal to T3 and that of > 7cm to T4. Bronchial involvement at a distance of less than 2 cm from the carina but without carina ingrowth has a T2 prognancy, as well as tumors with a total or partial atelectase/ poststenotic pneumonia (was previously T3 in TNM7). Ingrowth in the diaphragm now has a t4 forecast (was earlier T3). In TNm 8 no statement is required about the involvement of the mediastinal pleura. Any involvement of mediastinal fat, regardless of the involvement by vital structures, is defined as T4 in TnM 8. It should be noted that the TN M classification prognostic but no therapeutic implications is seen as regards for example to resectability. Thoraxwandinfiltration including parietal pleura and superior sulcus tumors are classified with T3. Infiltration of the parietale pericard and n. phrenicus, in close anatomical relationship with the boundary. In subsolid noduli, the length of the solid component in lung setting determines the clinical T stage. In addition, two new T categories for early adenocarcinomas have been introduced. They describe non-solid, only matt glass consisting of nodules or semi-solid noduli, which consist of a matt crystal and solid components. An adenocarcrima in situ (TIS), usually a matting glass lesion, pathologically only shows neoplastic cells along alveolar structures without signs of stromal vascular or pleural invasion. A minimal invasive adenocarcoma (MIA) shows pathologically a tumour with limited invasive growth (< 5mm) with predominant lepidic growth and on CT there is a mattress lesion < 3cm with a solid component < 5mm (Travis, 2016). There should also be no necrosis. TIS and MIA are characterized by a very good prognosis. There should also be no necrosis. TIS and MIA are characterized by a very good prognosis. For patients with multiple tumor noduli the classification is based on the following four patterns: a) tumors with different morphology, PET-avidity and histology must be classified separately; b) two tumornoduli of the same tumor type are T3 when they are in the same lobe, T4 if they are within the same lung and M1a when they're in both lungs; non-small cell lung carcinoma c) multiple mat glass lesions with dominant lepidic tumour growth are classified as T3 if T4 when in two unilateral lobes and if both lungs are involved (Detterbeck, 2016). The classification for T status is described in Table 1 Table 1 Overview of T status according to 8th TNM classification. AIS: adenocarcinoma in situ. MIA: minimal invasive adenocarcoma. (Source: Travis, 2016) T-status Category AIS Tis MIA T1mi ≤1cm T1a >1-2cm T1-b >2-3cm T1, T1c PL1/PL2 T2a >3-4cm T2b PL3 T3 >5-7cm T3>7cm T4 Bronchus <2cm T2, T2 Total atelectase T2 Diafragma mediastinalum, large vessels, trachea, oesophagus or vertebral body in growth T4 PL status The PL status is about growth in the pleura. Figure 2 shows the different degree of ingrowth. PL0 does not mean growth in pleura and does not change the T status. PL1 (door growth of the lamina elastica) and PL2 (ingrowth to the surface of the visceral pleura) T2. In PL3 it is recommended to use elastin staining. Figure 2 Degree of growth in the pleura with PL status (Source: Travis, 2008) N status The N status is unchanged compared to the 7th edition, where N0 does not mean lymph node invasion, N1 intrapulmonal or hilarious lymph noble invasion, N2 ipsileral mediastinal and N3 contralateral mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nod invasion (Table 2). Unlike other tumors, only the gland station (anatomic location) is still assessed but not the number of pathological glands. As in TNM 7, the classification of lymph nodal stations is based on the map of the International Association for the Study of Lung (IASLC) of 2009. Anatomical limits, the best to be assessed on CT in all 3 directions (coronal and sagittal) are the basis for the correct classification of the lymph nodes by e.g. hilair N1 and paratracheal N2 glands as well as between N2 and N3 to distinguish the upper thoraxaperture correctly (Rusch, 2009; El-Sharief, 2014).A magnification > 10mm in the shortest diameter is still considered as a definition for a gland enlargement. e Table 2 Overview N-status according to 8th TNM classification (Source: Asamura, 2015) Nx lymph gland involvement unverifiable N0 No regional gland involvement N1 Kliermetastases ipsilateral peribronchial, hilar and/or intrapulmonal N2, Kliermatastases ipsilateral mediastinal or subcarinal N3 Kliermetas contralateral mediastinal, hilair, scalenus or supraclalvicular M status The M status describes the place and extent of metastasis. A distinction is made between intrathoracal metastases, a single metastase and multiple metastas. A clear prognostic difference was seen between M1a, an oligometastase of 1 lesion in 1 orga multiple lesions in 1 organ and multiple metastases. This has caused a single metastase 1 organ to be called M1b and more metastasis M1c (Table 3 and Figure 3) (Eberhardt, 2015) Figure 3 Overview of survival by distinction M status (Source: Eberhardts, 2015), Table 3 Overview M-status according to 8th TNM classification (Sorry: Egerhardt. 2015) ed, on, se in M0 No distance metastas M1 Distance metastass M1A Separe tumornoduli in contralate pleural fluid or pericarde fusion.

In the context of a population survey of lung carcinoma, the Dutch-Leuvens Long Cancer Screenings Research (NELSON) was conducted. These stricter requirements lead to a positive screen at 485 (6%) of the 7582 participants after which 200 (2.6%) participants in lung cancer are determined. The positive predictive value of the screening is 40.6% and 1.2% of all scans are false-positive. Over a period of more than 5 years, the risk is to detect lung cancer by screening differently and depending on the results of the first scan, 1% risk after a negative scan, 5.7% after an uncertain result and 48.3% after a positive result.

Row 7: Not minor cell lungcarcribe: An American study finds lower costs associated with selective use of FDG-PET in patients with normal mediastinal lymph nodes and a T1-tumour on CT (33). In other American analyses, it appears that the number of patients with higher stages has increased since the introduction of F DG-PET. Also, there is a small beneficial effect on the survival of patients on stage III and IV. The translation of such studies into the Dutch context requires a systematic literature review of economic studies and modelling with Dutch data, which is outside the scope of this Directive. Row 9: Not small cell lung carcinoma: A new modality in the stadification of NSCLC is required to determine the location of this modularity in patients who have an NSCLEDfusion weighting' (MRI-DW).

The access times to a CT alone, the quality of the CT present in the FDG-PET-CT device, the possibility of contrast administration and the availability of integrated radiological and nuclear medical assessment. Preferably, the F DG-PET should result in a diagnostic CT in an integrated nuclear-medical radiological report. Because imaging prior to invasive diagnostics is a good organization with short access times. For design curative surgery at least an FDG PET (with low-dose CT) should be performed somewhere in the trajectory.

However, often a puncture or biopsy is needed to provide certainty. The same applies to liver abnormalities in which imaging research is not considered conclusive (9). FDG-PET is used to demonstrate (occult) metastases that are simpler to approach for pathological verification. Only for the absence of FDG uptake in an enlarged adrenal gland is not described so far as error negativity (95% CI: 0.95-1.0) (10) (12) (13). Conversely, there is no possibility of (light) increased absorption in skeleton genomes, and also here the value of a positive test is dependent on the capping point (specificity: 0.88; 95%-BI: 0.78-0,94) (13). For typing brain defects FDG‐PET due to the high physiological FDG absorption in the brain. The results suggest a significantly better specificity of FDG-PET in a slightly varying sensitivity. FDG‐PET is in favour of osteoblastic osteoblast bone scan. The literature on liver metastases is largely based on experience in colorectal tumours, which, like lung cancer in general, have an adequate affinity for FDG. The data suggest that FDG -PET has no added value when screening for liver metstatics (than with a feline state of the art' CT) (18) and that slightly increased uptake also occurs in benign abnormalities (19).

Age Row 3: Column_ 2: B. Cardiovascular risk factors There is virtually no specific literature on lung surgery. However, there is literature and an internationally accepted directive on the assessment of the cardiac risk for non-cardiac surgery (including lung surgery). The working group considered it possible to make recommendations based on these guidelines. Row 4: Column_2; C. Long function study There were sufficient data available for a risk assessment of perioperative mortality as a function of age and pulmonary function parameters forced-expiration volume in one second (FEV), 1 diffusion capacity (TLCO) and maximum oxygen uptake (VO max). The literature appears to contain only sporadic studies in which the quality of life after lung surgery is an outcome measure, which makes a conclusion impossible. Row 5: Non-small cell lung carcinoma: A. Age Patients over 70 years of age have an increased risk of surgery for lung surgery: over 1,500 lung operations in the region of IKNL Rotterdam found a perioperative mortality rate of 4% in this age group: 8% in pneumonectomies and 3% in smaller resections (1). In other studies a slightly higher mortality rate is often found (2) (3). Recent Dutch studies show a 30-day surgical mortality rate at 7.5% in patients over 75 years (4) (5). This increased risk in elderly patients is likely due to a higher co-morbidity. Among other data of the Flemish cancer registration showed that especially in right-sided pneumonectomy the surgical risk is increased: at all ages 10,6% and above 70 years 17,8% versus 3,9 and 8,1% in patients above 80 years of lung surgery. The estimated postoperative ejection fraction is the best measure for assessing the cardiac residual function. Recent American (ACCP) and English (BTS) guidelines for lung carcinoma refer to the directive of the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology regarding the preoperative cardiovascular evaluation for non-cardiac surgery (9). More recent additional information is described in a European directive of ERS/ESTS (11). In part, on the basis of this last directive, the Committee has formulated the following recommendations. C.

To the high mortality of a right pneumonecomtomy after prior to treatment should be explicitly considered.

Pathological research is done on both regional and mediastinal lymph nodes. Routine research of the lymph nod consists of the total inclusion of lymph nodes in thin slices in order to maximise the chance of finding lymph nogular metastases. The microscopic study routinely includes an HE (hamatoxyline eosine)-coloured coupe. Sufficient tissue or tumor cells should be sent in order for an adequate pathology and mutation analysis.

In the case of lymphogitis carcinomas, a diagnosis (metastatic adenocarcinoma) can be made, but there is probably not enough tumor related DNA to obtain a reliable predictive DNA or RNA related rash. Row 4: Not small cell lung carcinoma: In cytological material from pleural fluid, the chance of a reliable result is also dependent on tumour cell richness.

The potential benefits are less postoperative pain, a shorter hospital stay, less costs, better chemotherapy compliance and fewer complications. In a meta-analysis two randomised and 19 non-randomised studies (1) were studied. Fourteen studies reported a conversion of VATS to an open procedure of 0 to 15.7%. The meta-analysis shows that the VATS lobectomy is an acceptable procedure in the hands of experienced surgeons for selected patients with a resectable NSCLC. Another study shows that there were fewer pulmonary complications and that the hospital stay was shorter than with standard thoracotomy (2).

Possible deterioration of these glands is usually detected in routine freeze-coupe examination of the resurgery surface. In affected glands, it may be necessary to extend the reSection to a resection to a  piece-leeveve' lobectomy. This has due to the reduced morbidity and preservation of more lung function over a ponectomy (34). In cases where the highest intrathoracic station is found not to contain a tumour, a parenchymresection can be decided if it is clear that there are limitations of non-surgical therapy. M status The M1 status is relevant in the peroperative assessment only if there are more tumors in different lobes. In the surgical treatment then the principles as previously described are then followed. This means that a lobectomy in combination with a wigexcision or a pneumonectomy must be performed (58).

The TNM stage is determined according to the 7th classification of Goldstraw (see TNMC classification). In addition, it is determined whether a complete curative resection is possible. If the tumor proves to be peroperative, urbanization is especially important to determine a new treatment plan. Comparison of different treatment modes is possible only in the case of correct urbanization. Row 3: Not small cells lung cancer: 1. The diagnosis of NSCLC is also indicated as preoperative. If this is not possible, rapid diagnostics should be made available by means of a freezer coupe examination during the operation. The study preferably takes place on as limited a lung resection as possible (segment or wigexcision). In case of a central tumor a needle biopsy can be performed. When establishing malignancy can then be extended during the same procedure. Row 5: Not small cell lung carcinoma: Vriescoupe examination of the bronchus resection plane is important for intraoperative determination of residual tumour tissue. Different use of terms can lead to differences in morphological interpretation. Therefore, it is recommended to use uniform terms for tumor localization in the bronchus resection area. Four locations are distinguished: feline bronchial', known as \"mucosaal' or \"tribronchial'; In a bronchial, mucosal tumor is also indicated whether there is a carcinoma in situ, which can also spread within the basal membrane of seromukeous glands. Row 6: Non-small cell lung carcinoma: A microscopic tumor residue at the site of the bronchus resection plane results in statistically significantly less survival and a statistically significantly greater chance of recurrence, both locally and remotely (3) (4) (10) (11) (12) (13). In one of the studies referred to, a positive bronchusne surface was an independent prognostic factor (p=0.04) (14). In some studies, differences in percentages of survival and recurrence were found that were not statistically significant, probably partly based on insufficient statistical data, and incomplete data (6). Also, the risk of complications of anastomosis in bronchoplastic procedures is statistically significantly higher in the presence of a positive bronchospinal plane (14). In most studies, based on the above, it is recommended to perform intraoperative freeze coupe examination of the bronchostranectal plane and to extend the resection in case of positive Row 7: Not small cell lung carcinoma: PDF produced on 23-01-2025 99/428",

Randomisation takes place only if the sammed glands are intraoperatively negative. The 30-day surgical mortality and morbidity did not differ between the groups. In interpreting these study results, account should be taken of the period in which these studies were conducted. It is also important to note that they were carried out before the introduction of the pre-operative FDG-PET. In determining a position on mediastinal lymph Node Dissection versus mediastinal lymph gland sample sampling, consideration should be given to the fact that a definition of a complete resection has been formulated by both the IASLC (Rami Porta) and the European Society for Thoracic Surgery (ESTS) (the Leyn) in the ESTS definition is a condition for a full resection.",

In two randomised studies involving 331 and 568 patients, from the 1970s, in which prior to surgery a dose of radiation of 40 or 50 Gy was administered, survival was not increased in the radiotherapy arms (1) (2) It is noted that there was suboptimal diagnosis with inclusion of patients with small cell pulmonary carcinoma. In a more recent study involving 67 patients with N2- and/or T4 tumours randomisation took place to preoperative chemotherapy or preoperative radiotherapy 44 Gy in 22 fractions (3). In 50%, there was a response, independent of the type of pretreatment. The toxicity was significant with eight peri-operative deaths of 34 patients undergoing a surgical exploration. Radiotherapy as a postoperative treatment has the aim of increasing the locoregional control with additionally improved survival. Despite the improved local control, no demonstrable benefit in survival has been demonstrated so far.Possibly this has to do with the small number of patients, the suboptimal patient selection, the outdated radiotherapy techniques and the absence of chemotherapy.For patients with pN0-1, postoperative radiotherapy did not yield any profit after complete resection. A retrospective study reports a reduction in the number of local relapses due to postoperative radiation therapy at a positive mediastinal sneeze (5). Slater reported 50 Gy postoperatively in 19 patients with microscopic residual tumour and nine with macroscopic residual tumor (6). The 5-year survival rate was 46%. Radiotherapy appears to be effective, as it may be expected that without additional treatment the relapse risk would have been higher and the healing chance reduced. In the study of Sadeghi was randomised to macr scenic residue at pN2 or between postoperative Radiotherapy (split course' 2 x 20 Gy) already or not combined with chemotherapy (CAP) (7).6 The recurrence-free survival in the combined treatment arm was significantly contributed to better efficacy.

The control is not significantly different between tumours with a diameter of 5 or 8 cm, but much worse than between 1 and 5 cm128 33. Radiotherapy plus chemotherapy In particular in the nineties major studies on the added value of chemotherapy to radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC stage III were published in 1995 and 1996 and three meta-analysiss (approximately 3,000 patients) were published398 444 357. In about half of the studies cisplatin-containing chemotherapy was prescribed, with a dose ranging from 40 to 120 mg/m2. The intended radiation dose varied from 50 Gy in 20 fractions to 65 Gy in 30 fractions. These meta-analyses with cisplatin containing chemotherapy showed an absolute gain of 4% in 2 years. In addition, the majority of patients had a WHO performance' score of 0 or 1, and an analysis of stage IIIA versus IIIB was not performed. In these meta-analysis studies, studies with sequential chemo- and radiotherapy and chemotherapy were assessed as a whole. Efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was demonstrated in 1990.145. Patients with stage III A (and some with current stage IIB) were randomised to receive treatment with two courses of cisplatin-vindesin prior to 60 Gy radiotherapy or with radiotherapy alone. The median survival was still present at 13.8 months versus 9.7 months with a 3-year survival of 23% versus 11% (p = 0.0066) in favour of the combined treatment arm. After 7 years of follow-up, the survival benefit was still available144. Similar results were found in two other studies491 89. Le Chevalier et al. showed that the improved survival was not accompanied by better local control but only with less remote transcripts (70% versus 49%). In these studies, the radiotherapy dose varied from 45 Gy to 69.9 Gy. The EORTC published a major positive 3-arm phase III study496. In the control arm only radiotherapy was given (weeks 1, 2, 5 and 6), in the second arm also daily cisplatin 6 mg/ m2 and in the third arm weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m2). The 3-year survival was 2%, 16% and 13% respectively (p = 0.009). These results were confirmed in several randomised studies282 283. Furthermore, the EORTC study showed that this improved survival with cisplatin was directly due to better local control, without influence on the occurrence of metastases at distance496. In the meta-analysis of Auperin et al., there was a greater effect of combination of chemotherapy than monochemotherapy on the disease-free survival (HR 0.83, 95% CI., 0.72-0.95 versus 1.15, 95% CI, 0.90-1.48; p=0.02).",

Only if a complete resection can be performed (R0), surgery should be performed. Retention of tumor (R1) is prognostically unfavourable. Radiotherapy prior to surgery, often referred to as the standard in sulcus superior tumors, is largely based on old literature. An argument for preoperative radiotherapy is that the surgical procedure to be performed involves such morbidity that success of this procedure should be assured in advance. However, pre-operative radiotreatment does not improve survival in other groups of patients with an NSCLC (3) (5). With a radiotherapy dose between 55 and 65 Gy after non-complete resection, the probability of local control and survival of the chance after a dose between 45 and 55 Gy (6) is indicated by several chemotherapy. Gy) and 2 cycles with cisplatin and etoposide were followed by surgery achieved a 76% complete resection and a 44% 5-year survival in 110 patients with a T3-4, N0-1 NSCLC (11). In this group 88 of the 95 patients considered operable after chemoradiation had a thoracotomy. In 61% of the patients under surgery there was a pathological complete remission. The 5-year lifetime in the group undergoing a complete recess was 54% versus 44% for the whole patient group. In retrospective analysis of patients treated between 1994 and 2004 in the NKI-AVL, a total of 52 patients were treated with chemoradication, of which 12 were also undergoing resection. There were 27% stage IIB, 8% stage IIIA, 42% stage IIIB and 23% stage IV patients. The 5 year survival for patients who had been operated was 39%. In 8 of the 12 patients (66%) there was an pathological complete remission. On the other hand, a more aggressive approach seems to be justified, given the localization with often difficult to treat complaints if no local control is achieved. A multimodal approach with concomitant chemoradiotherapy and/or surgery appears to give the best results based on the current data. In patients in whom the primary sulcus superior tumor does not appear to be primarily resectable (clinical stage III), concomitant chemorradiotherapy is advised. Afterwards, monitoring of the response is important. If the tumor has become significantly smaller and/ or downstaging and resection appears to be possible in second instance, then this should be advised. Due to the complexity of the treatment of a Sulcus superiority tumor is preferred in a center; see Organisation of Care - Centre.

The difference between conventional fractional chemoradiotherapy and the two-daily regimens was not statistically significant (median surveillance 17.0 vs 15.6 months). The acute grade 3-5 non- haematological toxicity was higher in the concomitant chemorradiotherapy arm than in the sequential arm. Late adverse reactions were similar in both arms (Curran 2011).

In a Japanese trial, a benefit was seen with acute toxicness ≥ Grade 3, no significant differences in toxicity between elderly (≥ 71 years) or younger patients were observed. In a meta-analysis based on individual patient data, the risk factors for symptomatic pneumonitis were investigated. Older patients who received CCRT with carboplatin-paclitaxel had the greatest risk of lung toxicity. [Palma 2013(38) ]. Row 4: Not small cell lung carcinoma: What influence have technical improvements on the effects of radiotherapeutic treatment and Column_2: Row 5: Not small Cell lung cancer: The possibilities for radiation treatment have improved greatly over the last 10 years. This is due to many developments and new insights. A retrospective study from the MD Anderson Cancer Center showed a survival advantage through the use of 4D-CT plus IMRT [Liao 2010(49]. The Respiration Corrilated CT scan (RCCT) has been much better tolerated and the results have improved. The radiation plan includes this information, which allows the radiation to be directed more precisely at the tumor. By making better algorithms available for calculating the dose in inhomogenic tissue (extremely important in lung tissue) it could be started with intensity-modulated radiation (IMRT) [Govaert 2012(48)]. A big step forward because this technique makes the dose waste out of target volume sharper, and significantly increases its conformity to the target area [Schwartz 2005(51)] . This makes it possible to irradiate larger lung tumours safely with an effective dose. Row 6: Not small cell lung carcinoma: When planning via IMRT extra attention should be given to possibly increased dose in homogenity in the planning target volume (PTV; 90-115%). The esophagus is often located within the PTV. The maximum dose on the sluk gut was found to be responsible for both severe acute [Uyterlinde 2013b, Stabenau 2011] and late oesophag toxicity [Chen 2013(46] in the NSCL] which is combined with small fractioned by 24 G.

No study justifies the application of a non-platinum or high dose of platinum (>100 mg/m2) combination of chemotherapy in patients on PS 2. A randomised study (platinum-doublet versus platinum-doublet (4) and a study with sub-platin-doblet (4). A randomized study and in a subgroup analysis of another study showed a survival benefit of a doublet on monochemotherapy (6) (7).

The first EGFR-TKI to achieve a clinically relevant improvement in OS compared to the first generation EGFR-TCI in the entire (common) EGFR mutated population was not shown earlier for afatinib (in the LUX-Lung 7 study) as a survival benefit compared to gefitinib in the first-line treatment, however, the power calculation of this study was based on PFS and not on OS. For dacomitinib, a statistically and clinically significant survival benefit of more than 7 months was seen in comparison to gefitinib, however this was seen only in first-rate treatment in patients who did not have brain metastases at the start of treatment. For osimertinib, an OS benefit was seen with a median OS of 38,6 months (95%BI, 34.5 to 41,8) in the osimertinib group and 31.8 months (95% CI, 26.6 to 36.0) in the control arm (HR = 0.80, 95.05% CI, 0.64 to 1.00; P = 0.046) (Rlingamam, 2020). In absolute numbers, the highest PFS was seen with osimertinib, i.e. 18.9 months. The difference with gefitinib was 8.7 months, this difference has not been seen before with other TKIS.

As described in module \"Predictive tests' of this directive, among others, there are currently several predictive and diagnostic biomarkers that have a direct consequence for a choice of targeted lung cancer therapy (see also Lindeman, 2018; Garinet, 2018). part of the clinically relevant biomarkers also have a detection frequency of <5% such as ALK fusions (<3%) and ROS fusions [7].1%) for which recorded therapy is available (Tsao 2016). Row 7: Not small cell lung carcinoma: It is known from several international studies in which a molecular profile is made of larger series of tumor-biopts of lung cancer patients, that new genetic changes in other genes or in active domains of already known predictive markers (m.n. kinase domains) are present. These studies show that in advanced stages NSCLC many potential new markers are observed but with in almost all cases a frequency of<1% (TSao, 2016; Garinet, 2018; Jordan, 2017; CGARN, 2014; Barlesi, 2016); CLCGP, 2013). Despite the fact that this group of biomarkerrs could be excellent targets for targeted therapy, there will not be sufficient data available from clinical studies in the short term due to the very small numbers of patients with this rare consensus on which we may have been able to detect a specific drug response to be very limited to.",

The height of all ongoing clinical trials in Dutch (e.g. via NVALT website) but also due to their existing networks with pharmaceutical companies and connections with different MTB (see https://www.network-path.nl).

Apart from T790M, the known resistance mechanism in erlotinib and gefitinib (the first available EGFR -TKI) (Loong 2018) is not known about many of >3000 different EGFR mutations.

However, the quality of studies is insufficient to say that the missing statistical evidence indeed shows that there is no effect. Patient groups were relatively small and there is insufficient consideration of the initial tumor stage.

However, it has not been shown that this will worsen the prognosis. The literature on this subject is scarce and unconvincing. This conclusion is contrary to what has been found in patients with head neck tumours after surgery. In this patient group it has been demonstrated that postoperative delay of radiotherapy has a detrimental effect on the local relapse rate (17). Psychosocial stress Delay in the diagnostic or therapy pathway causes psychosocial stress in patients who have cancer. This finding has been investigated in patients suffering from breast cancer or a head-halstumour (18) (20) (21) (22) (22) (23).

Also in the Dutch situation there appears to be considerable variation between hospitals in the treatment of NSCLC (period 2001-2006). During this period significant differences were found in number and type of resections and in the application of chemotherapy. Also differences were demonstrated in survival. Although a significant correlation was found with the diagnostic volume and availability of radiotherapy, the variation between the hospitals under investigation was greater (5). In order to ensure optimal and continuous care, requirements should be imposed on the number of interventions carried out annually and on the minimum number of specialists and nurses (6). For the handling of the testis, mamma, ovary and oesophagitis carcinoma and for extensive surgical procedures. This approach lays down special requirements for the groups concerned and the way they function among themselves. Concentration of complex oncological care for lung tumours is necessary and should be based on criteria relating to the infrastructure, volume and specialisation of the hospital and demonstrably good outcomes of care. The scientific associations will increasingly have to take responsibility for the assessment of quality of oncological care provided by medical specialists (horizontal supervision). Reliable quality information should be reported to the public. See further the module Criteria referral specialist center.

Row 12: Not minor cell lung Carcinomae: Bronal involvement at a distance of less than 2 cm of the carina but without carina in growth have a T2 prognography, as well as tumors with a total or partial atelectase/postoption (Postonoidal growth) in T4. TNM 8 no longer requires a ruling on the involvement of the mediastinal pleural. Any involvement of mediastinal fat, regardless of the involvement in vital structures, is defined as T4 in TNm 8. It should be noted that the TN M classification has prognostic but no therapeutic implications for example regarding resectability. Thorax wall infiltration including parietal pleura and superior sulcus tumors are classified with T3. Infiltration of the parietale pericardium and the n. phenicus, in close anatomical relationship with the border mediastinal/ lung, are still seen as T3.

In subsolid noduli, the length of the solid component in lung setting determines the clinical Tstage. Row 2: Not small Cell lung carcinoma: Furthermore, two new T categories for early forms of adenocarcinomas have been introduced. They describe non-solid cells along alveolar structures with nodules or semisolide nodular, which consist of a matt glass and solid components. An adenocarcrima in situ (TIS), usually a matting glass laesion, shows pathological only neoplastic cells along any alvepolar structures without signs of stromal vascular or pleural invasion. A minimally invasive adenocarcinema (MIA) shows pathologically a tumour with limited invasive growth (< 5mm) with predomant lepid growth on a 3cm. There should also be no necrosis. TIS and MIA are characterized by a very good prognosis.
