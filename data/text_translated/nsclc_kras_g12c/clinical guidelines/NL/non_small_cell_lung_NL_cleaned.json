The directive addresses the following issues: diagnostics and treatment palliative care information and communication after-control, after-care and follow-up organisation of care and psychosocial care. Who is the purpose of the directive? This directive is addressed to all healthcare providers involved in care for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. For patients Not small cell lung cancer is a form of lung cancer. In the Netherlands lung cancer is found in almost 13. people per year. There are two different forms: small cell lung cancer and non-clumson lung cancer. About 85% of patients with lung cancer have the non-small cell form. classification is based on the type of cells present in the tumor. In non-small lung cancer cells are usually slow.",

Secondary investigations of this patient, an overall safety analysis of the use of tecemotide in non-small-cell cancer and introduction of safety measures by protocol amendment led to the clinical holding being lifted in June, 2010.

In men, the increase in this period was 16% and lung cancer was still the main cause of death due to cancer (25%). In women, this was more than doubled in the same period and lung cancer accounted for 21% of the total cancer mortality in 2011-2017.",

The total mortality decreased by 6.7%. In this study a positive result was defined as the presence of a nodule of ≥4mm. The number of error positive scans was 23.3%, the positive predictive value of a positive screen was 3.6%.

In doubt, if the exercise tolerance appears much better or much worse than expected from lung function testing, or in other situations where an increased risk is suspected, it is recommended to do an effort test with determination of the VO max.

The prognosis is limited: the 5-year survival is 20%. Resection feline block' is relatively simple. The diaphragm defect is primarily closed or with the help of a marlex prosthesis (44) (45). Also a resection of a part of the pericardium is simple (46). Growth through the mediastinalum is always considered prognostically poor, because the percentage of N2 attacking is high (47). Evaluation in a recent study shows a prognosis similar to that of patients with thoraxwandinvasion (45).

The TNM stage is determined according to the 7th classification of Goldstraw (see TNM classification). It also determines whether a complete curative resection is possible. Correct information about the extension of the process optimizes the likelihood of a complete resection. In addition, intraoperative urbanization is of importance for determining the prognosis and setting of adjuvant therapy. If the tumor peroperative irresectable is shown, urbanisation is especially important for determining a new treatment plan. Comparison of different treatment modes is possible only in the case of correct urbanisation.",

Because durvalumab should begin within 6 weeks of the last radiotherapy, it is desirable to schedule the CT scan within 3 weeks and preferably as soon as possible after the end of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy often causes multiple changes in the lungs and tumor and/or irradiated glands that are difficult to interpret. Therefore, abnormalities in the thorax to the contrary have been proven to be post-radiotherapy findings. Additional studies are only rarely required. The CT scan of thorax and upper abdomen is performed with intravenous contrast, unless there is a contra-indication. This CT scan is an additional study that needs to be performed and where sufficient capacity on the radiology department should be performed.",

Only if a complete resection can be performed (R0), surgery should be done. Retention of tumor (R1) is prognostically unfavourable. Radiotherapy prior to surgery, often referred to as the standard in sulcus superior tumors, is largely based on old literature. An argument for preoperative radiotherapy is that the surgery to be performed involves such morbidity that success of this procedure should be assured in advance. However, preoperative radiotherapy does not improve survival in other groups of patients with an NSCLC (3) (4) (5). With an radiotherapy dose between 55 and 65 Gy after incomplete resection increases the probability of local control and survival compared to the probability of this surgery.",

Row 5: Row 6: The probative force is small because both RCTs randomized a small number of patients. The largest study (Gomez, 2016) was stopped early by the IDMC because there was a clear improvement in progression free survival which made it undesirable to continue the study.",

On the other hand, it is still important to include patients in studies because for some patients the OS remains very limited and research needs to be done on which patients achieve the best results with radical local treatment.",

In specific patient populations from individual clinical studies or subgroup analyses some cisplatin combinations give a better survival than other cisplatinumbins (4) Docetaxel/cisplatin provides a virtually comparable survival than vinorelbine/cisplatin in a general NSCLC population (5), pemetrexed/cisplatin is better than gemcitabine/cisplatin for patients with non-plavice cell NSLC, and finally gemcitabine/cis is better than pemeplatin in a random cell.",

The latter two play a role as driver. For MET amplification is no registered treatment. Multiple case series and studies have shown ORRs from around 40 to 50% at METexon 14 skipping mutations with TKIs targeting MET, such as crizotinib, capmatinib and cabozantinib. An example is crizotinib in the PROFILE 1001 WITH exon 14 skipping cohort with an ORR of 44%. Retrospective series show a PFS of around 7 months with crizotinib (Drilon, 2016; Awad, 2017).",

That delay of treatment involves a deterioration of local control and survival in patients with lung cancer cannot be substantiated by the current saving literature.

This conclusion is contrary to what has been found in patients with head and neck tumours after surgery. In this patient group it has been shown that postoperative delay of radiotherapy has a detrimental effect on the local recurrence rate (17). Psychosocial stress Delay in the diagnostic or therapy pathway causes psychosocial stress in patients with cancer. This finding has been investigated in patients with a breast cancer or head and neck cancer (18) (20) (21) (22) (22) (22) (22) (22).",

In this study, some patients indicated that they could discuss their emotional and psychological problems better with a nurse than with the specialist, general practitioner or telephone. Although work for many cancer patients may be an important source of emotional support and financial independence, many cancer patients experience problems with work resumption. The 2009 Cancer and Work Directive provides further information (13). For lung cancer patients treated in a curative manner, problems may arise longer after treatment and therefore a programmatic approach in the aftercare as indicated by the directive on post-cancer recovery appears desirable (14).",
