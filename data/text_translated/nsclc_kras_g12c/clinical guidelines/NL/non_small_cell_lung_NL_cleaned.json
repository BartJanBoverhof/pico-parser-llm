The directive covers the following subjects: diagnostics and treatment palliative care information and communication after-control, after-care and follow-up organisation of care and psychosocial care For whom is the directive intended? This directive is addressed to all health professionals involved in care for those with non-small cell lung disease. For patients Not small cell pulmonary cancer is a form of lung cancer. In the Netherlands lung cancer is established per year in almost 13. In the case of non-little lung cancer cells are usually slow. This form of cancer is already spread out. More information about lung cancer can also be found on cancer. The Netherlands Society for Medical Onco icians for Lung diseases and Tuberculosis. Consensus con Consensusus meeting of the . Neth J Med 2001;58:52-61. u deology and nference on Non-small cell lung cancer - Epidemiology and pathogenic Epidemia Per year a lung cancer is diagnosed in more than 13,000 new patients; in about 70% of them it is an NSCLC Feb 2020). In 2012 it was diagnosed in 6,947 men and 4,924 women lung cancer. The total number of patients with lung cancer increased between 2000 and 2019 by 53% from 8,959 to 13,792. In men the increase in this period was 16% and is still the main cause of death due to cancer (25%). In women this period this is more than doubled and lung cancer has now been responsible for 21% of the total cancer mortality. In 2011-2017 the 1-year survival of all patients with NS CLC 48%; the 5-year survival is 22%. For adenocarcinoma, in addition to smoking air pollution is an important contributing factor. According to a large European study, the lung cancer risk is associated with air pollution (HR 1.22; 95% CI., 1.03-1.45) per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM . That risk is lower than the risk of smoking for which the relative risk 23.3 and 12.7 is for current male and female smokers respectively [Raaschou-Nielsen 2013(9).]. However, the overall risk of air pollution, given that everyone is exposed to it. The risk of lung cancer in the Netherlands is 80 to 85% related to smoking and for at least 8% to fine dust, in particular in the adenocarcribes [WHO 2009; Beelen 2014(5)]. Approximately 10% of smokers develop their lung cancer during their lifetime. Smoking and non-smoking related lung carcinoma are distinguished disease images with different range of DNA mutations; these diseases require different treatments. Screening should be stopped from being smoked for 15 years or if there is a health problem where life expectancy is limited and a curative lung surgery is no longer possible. This definition differs only to a small extent from the inclusion criteria of the NELSON study. Another way to define the risk group comes from the Liverpool Lung Project (LLP). In this model the age, pack years, gender, passive smoking, pneumonia, asbestos contact and family history is added. In any screening of smokers it is important to simultaneously pay a lot of attention to smoking. This approach would increase the cost effectiveness of the screening by 20 - 45% [Villanti Screning of nodules with a low-dose CT requires expertise in volume measurements. Underbuilding Conclusions There are indications that screening with low-dosed CT reduces the mortality due to lung cancer. NLST 2011(3) Summary literature Although a number of scientific associations of lung carcinoma screening in high-risk groups (with low-cell lung cancer and ex-sockers is required by the The positive predictive value of screening is 40.6% and 1.2% of all scans are fault-positive. Over a period of more than 5 years, the risk of determining lung cancer by screening is different and depending on the outcome of the first scan, 1% risk after a negative scan, 5.7% after an uncertain result and 48.3% after a positive result. The number of error-positive scans is lower in the NELSON study (1.2% than in the NLST (23.3%).

References Starting question What is the place of the FDG-PET in the diagnostics of the mediastinalum? Recommendation Patients with NSCLC who are eligible for a curative treatment, serve as a first choice to undergo a combined FDG PET/diagnostic CT. A diagnostic CT is a second choice. Since in patients with a NSCLC there is often an indication for both CT and FDG-PET, it is efficient to combine an FDG‐PET in one session with a CT with diagnostic quality. Whether this is feasible depends on local conditions, such as logistics around access to the FDG -PET-CT, access times to a CT alone, the quality of the CT present in the F DG-PET-CTP device, the possibility of contrast administration and the availability of integrated radiological and nuclear medicine assessment. Preferably, the FDC-PET with a diagnostic CT should result in an integrated nuclear medicine radiological report. As image formation precedes invasive diagnostics, a good organization with short access times is important. For planned curative surgery, at least in the path a FDG (with low-dose CT) should be performed. In this case, a low-dose CT (ray load of approx. 1-3 mSv) is not produced with FDG PET images and for the determination of the anatomical localizations with increased metabolic activity. Then, in the same session, a diagnostic quality CT can be made with intravenous X-ray contrast. The FDG-PET is only useful for urbanisation if the primary tumour includes FDG. FDG FDGs. F DG-PET for mediastinal metastases The literature on FDG PET at NSCLC is now more than 10 years old and consists of a generous amount of systematic literature overviews, meta-analysis, diagnostic accurate studies, scenario analysis studies and outcomes studies (including some new randomised studies). (1) (3) (4) (7) (8) (9) (10). The picture that emerges from this confirms that the FDG PET for the urbanization of the enzyme sensitivity is still the CT. Kwaltative high-level meta-analy analysis, scenario analyses and results studies (which include some new random studies). The FDG-PET-CT study is based on the theory that 80% of patients with FDG -PET-CT have been properly stabilised (CT 56%), 7% are understabilised (CT 26%) and 13% overstabilized (CT 18%). In six other diagnostic accuracy studies with FDC-PET and FDG‐PET- CT of which two are retrospective and four are prospective, sensitivities of 40-81% have been reported and specificity of 70-98%. However, the PET component in the FDG PET-CT has found that the F DG-PT-CT is more sensitive and specific than in the older literature on FDG PET alone. Combining the FDP-PT and CT component leads to better diagnostic quality. Cerfolio is a better predictive for stage I and II than FDG PET alone (Stage I: 52 versus 33% correct predictions; in Stage II this is 36%). In the study of Yang with FDG-PET-CT, an extensive analysis of mediastinal glands was carried out with all individual glands available a FDG - PET-CT and histology (18). The sensitivity/specificity of the FDG PET was respectively 86/85%, and those for CT 69/71%. The findings of the PET corrected 81% of the error-negative interpretations of CT and 72% of error-positive interpretations. Conversely, the findings of CT 57% of false negative FDG PET interpretations and 45% of false positive interpretations are based on individual lymph nodes and not on the patient's TNF data can be calculated from the data that if the CT does not show an enlarged asymptomatic glands and the F DG-PET positive (metabole activity) is 56% of the lymph nodes is a metastase and if FDG‐PET is negative then there is only 3% of the patients' corporate. In 21%, this is a solitary deviation of which 54% is related to lung carcinoma and 46% is linked to another malignancy, benign and premaligne colonpolies, Warthin's salivary gland tumors, granulomas, hyperplastic thyroid nodi, inflammation or benign disorders. The accuracy of the FDG-PET to show adrenal metastases approaches 100% but this concerns deviations > 15 mm (5). The combined sensitivity/specificity for all intra-abdominal (liver, adrenal) metastasis was respectively 85%/56%, where often the CT with contrast administration as a reference test was used. Although error-possibility is rare a biopsy is performed to confirm it. This applies to any solitaire metastatic lesions. For the detection of brain metastass, the F DG-PET and FDG‐PET-CT is not appropriate due to the high background activity of brain tissue; the MRI is the examination of choice. The FDG -PET is suitable for the detection in skeletal antigens and the function of the liver. The negative predictive value of an FDG-PET is low when a CT is seen a small solitary pulmonary nodus (< 1 cm); however, the positive predictive value for a small loss is great again.

References Exit question Which diagnostics should be done when suspected of metastases in patients with NSCLC? Recommendation FDG‐PET and MRI of the brain should be performed in patients who have a NS CLC at clinical stage III. FDG -PET is recommended to exclude metastasis at a distance prior to scheduled curative treatment. It is preferable to use a postcontrast MRI in the screening of brain metastass. The sensitivity of a post-contratistic MRI can be increased by using a double dose, if available, by applying the technique. However, in a planned curative treatment, imaging diagnostics to distance metastases to skeletal, liver, adrenals or brain with FDG-PET and/or MRI of the brain are necessary. Level 1: A2 Pieterman 2000. (21) Summary of literature When presented, about one third of patients with NSCLC symptoms have remote metastasis. Where organ-specific complaints and findings often indicate the dissemination study, it is different from nonspecific factors known to be associated with increased risk of non-small cell lung carcinoma distance metstatics, such as anaemia and weight loss (1). Dissemination research into extrathoracic metastass focuses on locating agents with increased probability of metastas in skeleton, livers, adrenal glands and brains, using respectively FDG -PET, CT (adren, liver) and/ or MRI brain. If liver and adrenals at the initial CT are examined, then the examination of bone and cerebral corroses is carried out in accordance with an increased risk in intestinal conditions. This makes it clear that the disadvantage of \"routine\" dissemination studies in each patient' is not necessarily delayed and morbidity due to the additional tests (with relatively high error-possibility at low probability) (8). Also when stratified application of dissemination studies does not require tissue verification of observed abnormalities. Nevertheless, there is a number of basic principles. In a patient where thoracic pathology is suspected and the diagnosis is not clear, imaging of the thorax will be required, a CT of the chest/ upper abdomen with contrast (note to contra-indications such as renal impairments). In a subject who may be considered for a surgical, chemotherapy or stereotactical treatment, an FDG PET/diagnotic-CT is considered as a first imaging study. Conversely, (lightly) increased intake can occur in adrenal adenomas, and also here the value of a positive test depends on the cut-off point (specificity: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.78-0.94) (13). For typification of brain abnormalities, FDG-PET has no value due to the high physiological FDG uptake in the brain (14). There is not much direct comparative study between skeletal scintigraphy and FDG -PET (15) (16) (17). Usually, the results suggest that the tests in a number of tumor types have been examined, including tumors that can accumulate notorally bad FDG (prostate, mammacarcinoma). The results suggest a clearly better specificity of FDG PET in a slightly varying sensitivity. FDG‐PET is in the advantage of osteoblastic metastass. The literature on liver metastases is largely based on colorectal tumors, which are similar to lung cancer in the FDG. The data suggest that FDG's sensitivity is not relevant to liver properties with liver status. Recommendation In all patients with evidence of pulmonary carcinoma, a limited laboratory study should be conducted on at least hemoglobin, calcium, albumin, sodium, lactate-dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase. Extensive laboratory research is carried out to estimate organ functions before treatment. Considerations Laboratory research is conducted not for urbanisation purposes, but in particular for differential diagnostic reasons and as preparation for treatment. For logistical reasons, it is virtually different provisions to be implemented all at once. Support Conclusions For the stading of patients with NSCLC have determinations of haemoglobin, calcium and albumin, Sodium, LactdehydroGENase and alkalisch phosphatase have no value; however, they have some prognostic value. Level 1: A2 Beckles 2003; (1) Silvestri 1995, (2) Hillers 1994; (4) B Alatas 2002. (5) Summary of literature Laboratory research has little value in the diagnosis of lung carcinoma and the determination of possible treatment modes (1). Due to the lack of specificity and exact relationship with the disease stage, markers do not play a direct role in the diagnostics. Finally, the characteristic of Non-small cell lung carcinoma these tumour markers that alter the concentration in serum as the tumour volume increases or decreases. This means that an increased value for a R0 resection has a little predictive value, but a postoperative persistent increased value means a high risk of short survival (National Academy Clinical Biochemistry. Laboratory Practical Guidelines 2003). In short, tumor markers have no value for diagnostics and in specific situations and for follow-up lights a limited value.

In patients over 80 years without major comorbidity and in good condition, a resection as a treatment modality should be considered if doctor and patient consider the surgical risk acceptable. Cardiovascular risk factors Preoperative should be detected by means of anamnesis, physical examination and ECG heart diseases such as coronary disease, heart failure, valve disease and arrhythmias. In the case of intended lung surgery and (suspecting) a heart disease, a cardiologist, an intensive care medical or an anesthesiologist should make an estimate of the perioperative risk and advise on the perisurgical policy. Lung function study If the forced-expiration volume is not met in one second (FEV) and the diffusion capacity (TLCO) both > 80% are expected to be used for the purpose of the long operation and there is no unexpected dyspnoea d'effort is not considered to be an increased. In case of doubt, if the exercise tolerance appears much better or much worse than is expected from lung function research, or in other situations where an increased risk is suspected, it is recommended that an exercise test be performed with determination of VO max. The theoretical background of this recommendation is that the VOmax is the most physiological 2 2 value that can expose the weakest link in heart, lungs, vessels or muscles. Underbuilding Conclusions Age Over 70 years the perioperative risk for lung surgery has been increased, especially for pneumonectomy, especially on the right-hand side. This increase is mainly due to increased comorbidity. Above 80 years, the perisurgical risk appears to be increased even more.

(36) Long function study There are indications that there is no increased risk of surgery if: the post-bronch For the following three factors it was tried to make a statement: A. Age B. Cardiovascular risk factors There is virtually no specific literature on lung surgery for this purpose. However, there is literature and an internationally accepted directive on the assessment of the cardiac risk for non-cardiac surgery (including lung surgery). The working group considered it possible to make recommendations on the basis of these guidelines. C. Long function study There were sufficient data available for a risk assessment of perioperative mortality as a function of age and lung function parameters forced-expiration volume in one second (FEV), diffusion capacity (TLCO) and maximum oxygen uptake (VO max). For other lung function parameter and for blood gas values in rest or during effort there are no or insufficient indications of an influence on the operating risk in the literature. For other factors that may affect the operating hazard, such as diet status, performance' status and other co-adherability, no literature was found specifically for lung surgery. The estimated postoperative ejection fraction is the best measure for estimate of the cardiac residual function. Recent American (ACCP) and English (BTS) guidelines for lung cancer refer to the directive of the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology regarding the preoperative cardiovascular evaluation for non-cardiac surgery (9) (10). More recent additional information is described in a European directive of ERS/ESTS (11). Partly on the basis of this last directive, the committee has formulated the following recommendations: C. Long function study Figure 1: Flow diagram for determining peroperative risk for lung surgery, by means of lung function study. FEV = forced expiration volume in one second TLCO = difussion capacity VO max = maximum oxygen absorption method means that the relative functional contributions of the right and left lung we calculated with the perfusion is calculated by the perscan However, for the calculation of the FEV ppo and TLCO ppo the calculation method is used: the relative functional contribution of the right and left lung is calculated with the perfusion scan, and in (bi)lobectomy the functional contribution from the remaining lobes is calculated by the segment method (the number of remaining segments divided by the total number of segments). In most studies, if the FEVA ppo is > 40% and the TL CO ppo > 40%, there is no increased risk for resection (14) (16) (21) (22) (22) (22) (27). If the Fev ppo was < 30% or if both FEV ppo and TlCO pPO is < 40%, the operating risk in 1 1 1st study is increased (14) (16) (22) (25) (27). That these values are not synonymous with inoperability, it is apparent from a number of patients with low FEV values without increased mortality. In that study, which has passed away perioperative except patients with poor lung function also two patients with a good FEV (2.5-3 l) and such poor VO max. Bolliger et al. have calculated a VO Max ppo using VOmax 2 2 and lung perfusion scan (14). In that research, there was no peri operative mortality at a FO max ppo > 10 ml/min/kg and a high mortality at an VO maximum ppo < 10 ml /min/ kg. Not all studies have found a link between VO Maximum and Perioperative mortality/morbidity (14). Although in most studies the VO-max is expressed in ml/Min/kg, it is also argued to include the predicted value of the FOmax in the calculation of the above, because in the former one would not be taken into account under- or overweight, gender and age. In this study, a Vo max ppos of 35% of the forecast value as a limit value is to be maintained. However, the literature is still not able to draw conclusions.

Version 2011 It is likely that there is an increased detection of (occulte) metastases with additional immune histochemical research and/or molecular tec. Level 2 B Yasumoto 2003 In the most important studies in which the presence of tumor cells in the hilarious and/or mediastinal lymph nodes of patients with NSCLC with these sensitive techniques has been investigated [Liptay 2002(3); Gu 2002(2); Izbicki 1996(4); Maruyama 2000(5); Kawano 2002(6); Osaki 2002(7); Oosterhuis 2001(8); Chen 1993(9); Dobashi 1997(10); Hashimoto 2000(11); Sioris 2000(12); Nicholson 1997(13); Osaki2002(7), Marchevsky 2003(22); Nosotti 2005(15); Melfi 2008(16), as mentioned in the Directive 2004], an average of 38.5% (range 0-77,8%) is observed in the recent literature for serial cross-sections with HE in combination with immunohistochemistry of 17% (range: 15-22%), and with respect to RT-PCR in 33% (10-89%)). Since it is more difficult to make a certain distinction between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in biopsies with a haematoxyline-eosine colouring (HE) is more likely to make the diagnosis of NSCLC than in resections (20-40%). A recent Dutch study shows that a panel of additional colors on biopsy allows a better differentiation between adeno- and plaveise cell differentiation: slime staining, cytokeratine 7 and TTF1 coloring helps for adenodifferentiation, and p63 for squamile cell differentiation [Thunnis 2011(24)]. An unambiguous colour pattern is present in about 80% of the doubts [Nicholson 2010(25); Khayata 2009(26)], when unique positivity with TTF1, cytokerate 7 and/or mucusic stain is preferred for adenocarcromatoma. Recommendation In operable patients with an NSCLC whose growth is limited to one lobe, a lobectomy with systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection may not be the treatment of choice. Patients with such limited lung function that a lobectomy is not possible, are eligible - when surgery is considered - for a segment resection or possibly wigexcision, if the tumor can be fully resected. Stereotactic radiotherapy should be considered (for argument see further in the directive). If a lung tumor grows from a lobia in a adjacent lobe then in principle a loboectomy with a wigressection from the adjacent lob is not feasible. If it is a central tumor, it is chosen for a bilobectomy or pneumonectomy. If due to tumor growth up to or beyond the level of a bronchus a conventional lobecctomy, then a lobescectomy is possible. If peroperatively it is often found that there are more tumors in one lobe (T3), a lobectomy is carried out. If several tumors occur in different lobes (T4), a primary resection is an option. Recitals 1. T1-T2-tumurs, to parenchym If the tumor can be completely reset by means of a resection that is more limited than lobecctomy in patients who are pulmonary compromised, the N1 status cannot be allowed to extend the resection further. 2. Throughgrowth tumor to other lobe, bronchusostium or a. pulmonalis A lobeectomy combined with a wigexcision from the other lob is eligible if the growth is limited or peripheral can be considered. If the transitory growth is central to the fisssure, often is a pneumonectomy the treatment of choice. According to the working group, the percentage of the This form of lung surgery should take place in a center. In open thorax it often requires a lot of preparing work in large and/or nearby tumors before being properly assessed or a complete resection can be performed. It is incorrect to qualify a tumor based on volatile inspection as irresectable. Underbuilding Conclusions In patients with a T1N0 or T2N0-NSCLC provides a lobectomy the best prognosis and the lowest probability of local recurrence and is therefore the resection of choice in those cases. Level 2: A2 Ginsberg 1995; (1) B Jensik 1979, (59) Erret 1985, (2) Temeck 1992, (3) Weissberg 1993, (4) Warren 1994, (5) Martini1994 (60) Landreneau 1997 (7) If co-morbid a lobectomy is not possible, there is a place in patients with T1 N0 or N0-NTCLC for a segment resection or possibly on the basis of 2. There are indications that a separate resection (first extrapleural and then thorax wall) does not worsen the prognosis. The 5-year survival ranges from 16 and 56% if the resection is complete and the lymph nodes are not affected. Level 3: C Ratto 1991, (36) Shah 1994, (38) Pitz 1996, (64) Downey 1999, (39) Elia 2001, (41) Magdeleinat Tumors that grow into the pericardium and diaphragm, are resectable with acceptable survival.

(47) If more tumors in the same quab (T3) or in different quabs (T4 on the same side, otherwise M1a) are prevented and there is no pleuritis carcinomamatosa (M1a), is still detectable by level 3: Detterbeck 2001.

The results of the study of the Lung Cancer Studiy Group (LCSG) were therefore compared to 117 similar patients undergoing a lobectomy (7). The 5-year survival of the patients with an open widesection was 58%, of patients with a VATS widesection 65% and of patients who underwent a lobectomy 70%. The results therefore confirmed the outcome of the research of the Lang Cancery Studiy group (LCCSG). In Japan, a number of studies were conducted in which tumours < 2 cm were treated with a segmentresection (8). The 5-year survival of T1-T2-tumors after a segment or wigresection in patients with compromised lung function ranges from 42 to 69% (2) (12) (13). There are no comparative studies comparing this patient population with deliberate curative radiotherapy. Tumor growth to another lobe, bronchusostium or arteria pulmonalis If tumor tissue grows from one lobe in another or there is growth of tumor tissues at the ostium of the bronchus or ingrowth in the a. pulmonalis, a (bi)lobectomy may not be sufficient. However, a pneumonectomy will be considered. In a recent study with 485 patients a much higher morbidity and mortality than a lobectomy was found. In an investigation from 1983, in which the Lung Cancer Study Group 2200 resections were investigated, the mortality after a pneumonce was 6.2% and after a lobectomy (2. (14). The first large series with 37 angioplastic interventions (32). They reported a high postoperative mortality rate of 17% in a double sleeve'. Later on, good results were reported in small series (33). More recently, in publications on the laceve'-resection occasionally called \"double sleeve', like the 21 patients in the Okada et al study (34). They found no special complications due to the reconstruction of the pulmonalis artery. There is little explicit literature on the subject. In fact, there is only one group that published much about it (35). In a series of 52 patients with a reconstruction of artera pulmonalis no increased morbidity and mortality were found. The 5-year survival rate was 38.3% for the whole group. Table 1 'Sleeve' resection and pneumonectomy.

Prognosis is limited: the 5-year survival is 20%. Resection  piece' is always considered prognostically poor, because the aperture defect is primarily closed or using a marlex prosthesis (44) (45). Also a resection from a part of the periccard is simple (46). In most of the series, the majority of patients whose growth is limited to the adventitia should be maintained. A subadvential resection takes place. In the case of growth through the entire wall, theoretical resection is possible with the aid of cardiopulmonal bypass (55). The Master et al. describe 12 patients with spinal impairment with a 5-year survival of 42% (56). In recent years, experience has been gained in this respect in the surgical treatment of sulcus superior tumors (57). The tumor in the oesophagus is generally considered to be irresectable. There is no literature that supports this position. It is generally accepted that a pleuritis carcinomatosa Irrectable. More tumors in a quab are included in the current 7th TNM classification of the T3 tumors. During the procedure, it is often not possible to distinguish between multiply occurring pulmonary and intrapulbs. Part of the resection is then a curative complete mediastinal lymph node dissection.In cases where the highest intrathoracic station does not contain a tumor in a freezer coupe examination, a parenchymresection can still be decided if it is clear that there are limitations of non-surgical therapy.M status The M1 status in the peroperative assessment is only relevant if there are more tumors in different lobes.In the surgery treatment are than the principles as previously described.This means that a lobectomy in combination with a wigexcision or a pneumonectomy must be performed (58).

Vriescoupe research of the bronchus resection plane is important for the intraoperative determination of residual tumor tissue. Different use of terms can lead to differences in morphological interpretation. Therefore, it is advised to use uniform terms for tumor localization in the bronchus resection area. It distinguishes four locations: •bronchial', namely •mucosal' or •peribronchional' (i.e.: outside the cartilage), and •extrabronchical', which is further named as •in the barrels' or ? • in the thorax wall (and the hilus) ' (1) (3) (4) (5) (7) (8) (9). Per localization is indicated whether there is an invasive growth and whether the tumor has grown in lymph vessels. In a bronchial, mucosal tumor is also indicated whether in situ, which can also expand within the basal membrane of seromous glands. (R0: no tumour tissue remaining in the resection areas; R1: microscopic tumor tissue remaining; R2: macroscopic residual tumour tissue left behind). If no freeze coupe study has been carried out and postoperative organoleptic examination shows that residual tumour tissues are present at the bronchoresectal surface, resurgery is recommended in patients at stage I and II (3) (12) (9). However, a reintervention gives an increased risk of mortality and complications (17). In a peripheral tumor, freezer coupe examination is unlikely to be indicated, since the extension of the tumor beyond the macrurgical perceptible tumour limit is limited to a maximum of 3 cm (2) (18) Depending on the expansion of the tumour, other resection surfaces may also be eligible for a narrowing of 90% (21). The final status of the N1 and N2-lymph glands should therefore be determined on the basis of the organoleptic examination of the intra-pulmonal, hilarious and mediastinal lymph nodes removed during the operation.The probability of metastases in an mediastinal lymph node (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) is the standard component of the interoperative evaluation of N-status is the dissection of all N1 stations on which a tumor drains.The lymph nodes of station 12 (lobectomy) are included in the block' with the lobectomy preparation.The lymphatic glands of stations 11 (inter-lobary) and 10 (hilair) are usually separated.During pneumonectomy the intrapulmonale and hilar lymph nodes in preference are removed with the resection of the rectum. In the absence of intraoperative evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes (see Diagnostic) 2. Intraoperative inspection and palpation are not reliable methods for the detection of lymph node metastases. This was demonstrated, among other things, by a study of 95 patients undergoing a pulmonary resection due to NSCLC, where the intraoperative visual and pallatory findings of 287 mediastinal lymph nodes were compared to the monoclonal findings. The sensitivity of inspection and palmation was 71% and the specificity 94%. In 9 of the 95 patients was the assessment of lymphatic node stations error negative (39). In a retrospective comparative study, systematic lymphatic gland sampling' and complete mediastinal lymph gland dissection 2,7 times so much (95% CI: 1,2-6,3) N2 disease diagnosed with lymphosampling on the basis of abnormal intraoperative findings (40). A positive lavage is more often found in a higher TNM stage and is related to a worse prognosis (46) (47) (52) (48) (49) (50). Multivariate analysis in one of these studies showed that a positive cytology result of the pleural lavage was an independent determinant of the prognification (50). However, survival is better than in patients with pleural effusion based on pleural carcinoma (50). In the study of Hillerdal et al., a difference in 3 year survival was found, which was not statistically significant: 64% in a negative cytology outcome Not small cell lung cancer versus 41% in a positive (53). It is conceivable that the statistical coumarin power of this study was insufficient to show a significant difference. \"Sentinel'-lymphtheria-sampling' of Ver mediastinal lymph nodes trac lym Systematic mediastinal Rou lymph node-to-sambling' to Complete mediastinal lymphatic lymph noge dissection bev Intention curative mediastinal olym and lymphatic gland dissection lym to Table 5 Prognostic value of pleu First Under Number of Onde author; search type pat. year of publication escoupe HE-Ntb Fout-po colored error-neg paraffin 0.7%; fo coupe graderin escoope HE - Ntb Fout-po coloured error-nog paraffincoupé 1.7% escaupe HR-gecolored 100 100 100 paraffincoups ne-eosine * = long + thorax; no subdivision macroscology ** = long+ pleura; no further distribution *** = lon terature for evaluation of reclimatal lymph noising and pal glandes guided by palthythyresis Yearly survival 35% and negative result 69% 3 In positive result 3-C yearly survival 41.2% and in negative result 60.2% (p > 0.05) 1 At stage I with C positive result significantly worse survival than with negative result Okada Non- 1000 Pleural lavage 4.5 5-year survival at Rash pleurale C 2003 (54) comparatively after positive result 28% lavage thoracotomy; and at negative cytology Giemsa and rash 68% (p < independent Papanicolaou 0.0001) prognostic staining; factor (p = Papaniculaou 0.029); IV and V positive metastases at distance more frequent than local recurrence 42.2 versus Response Last reviewed: 22-05-2011 Last authorised: 22.05-2011 For full accountability, evidence tables and any related products, please refer to the Guidelines database.

Neoadjuvant chemoimmune therapy with adjuvant immunotherapy (perioperative treatment) Neoadjuvant immune therapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab) with chemotherapy in combination with adjuvant immune therapy may result in longer overall survival, event-free survival and response, than only neoadjovant chemotherapy. And perioperative treatment may also give more side effects. The effect on quality of life is unknown. Adjuvanted immune therapy with or without prior chemotherapy Adjuvant immune treatment (pembrolizumab or atezolizumab) with or unpredicted chemotherapy might result in better disease-free survivability than placebo/best supportive care with or no prior chem therapy. For total survival it is uncertain whether there is a positive effect. AdJuvant immunotherapy may give more adverse effects. For the advanced stages, from IIIA to IIIB, there is no consensus on the best control-arm treatment. In neoadjuvant chemoimmune therapy there is a real risk that patients will not undergo the scheduled surgery due to side effects of the treatment. Several studies show that a significant proportion of patients end up not having surgery, often due to disease progression or treatment-related complications. A clinically very relevant demand is the role of adjuvant immune therapy after neoadjovant Chemoimmune Therapy and Surgery. Current studies do not answer this question. Therefore, no small cell lung cancer is important in determining the most appropriate therapy. Testing on EGFR and ALK mutations for the operation becomes increasingly important for the adjustment of neoadjivant treatment to patients with an oncogenic driver has the added value of immune therapy in the setup of the patient's This resulted in the approval of the FDA for this particular patient group. However, the EEA has only approved the treatment of patients in stage II-III with a PD-L1 expression of at least 50%. Remarkably, the KEYNOTE-091 study showed that there was an advantage of adjuvant pembrolizumab for the entire study population, independent of the stage and without specific selection based on PD- L1 expression. The FDA and EMA have approved this indication. Except for patients with negative PD-l1 expression, one should be reluctant to use neoadjuvant or adjuvant immune therapy in patients with tumour DNA aberrations associated with reduced immune therapy. Examples of this type of feline tumor mutations are STK11 or KEAP1 mutations and low tumour mutational burden (TMB) (of the Hair, 2024). These patient groups show a lower response and reduced progression to immune therapy For this particular group chemotherapy should be considered. In addition, higher pCR- and MPR-rates were observed in comparison to the control group, with OR of 6.64 (95% CI 3.40-12.97) and 4.01 (95% CI 2.48-6.49) in favour of the nivolumab arm respectively. The subgroup analysis of both the pCR and the EFS showed that the benefit for the entire study population was mainly seen in the PD-L1 positive subgroup. Despite the intensified treatment regimen, the surgical and treatment-related adverse reactions remained similar between the two groups (Cascone, 2023). Of the KEYNOTE-671 study an update of the co-primary endpoint OS was presented with a median follow-up time of 36.6 months showed a significant improvement of the OS in the pembro arm, with a HR of 0.72 (95% CI 0.56-0.93; P = 0.00517) and a median OS not yet reached, compared to 52.4 months in the placebo arm. In any patient who is considering neoadjuvant or adjuvanted chemoimmune therapy, a molecular analysis of the NSCLC should be performed because in patients with specific aberrations immune therapy should be omitted. Costs The cost-effectiveness study of Das (2023) evaluated atezolizumab versus best supportive care (according to American commercial payer perspective). Atezoli1/2006 provided 1.045 extra quality-adjusted life years (QALY) at an incremental cost of $48.956, which resulted in an incremental non-small cell lung cancer cost-efficiency ratio of $46.859/QALY. Das (2023) concluded that in the case of a willingness threshold of $150,000/QAly and an incremental costs-effectiveness ratio of$46.849/Qaly atezlizumab cost-effective compared to best support care.

GRADE Source: - Summary of literature Neoadjuvant chemotherapy Description of studies The CheckMate 816 trial (For the purpose of this practice) At 24 months, 82.7% of the patients was alive in the nivolumab-pluschemotherapy group, versus 70.6% in the chemotherapy-alone group (HR: 0.57) (Forde 2022). Event-free survival Event- free survival was longer in the group of patients receiving nivolimab plus chemotherapy (31.6 months; 95% CI 30.2 to not achieved) compared to the group's patients that received chemotherapy (20.8 months; 95 CI 14.0 to 26.7) (HR No further downgrading was applied for potential publication bias (selective reporting included in RoB). The NADIM-II trial (Provencio 2023) is an open-label RCT conducted at 21 hospitals in Spain. Patients with previously untreatable stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC (8th TNM classification) and no known EGFR/ALK alterations were considered eligible. A total of 86 patients were randomized to receive nivolumab (360 mg) plus platinum-based chemotherapy (3 cycles) (n=57) or chemotherapy alone (n=29), followed by Surgery. The median overall survival was 17.0 months (95% CI: 14.3-22.0) in the placebo group. (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.46-0.72; p<0.001, in favour of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy) (Wakelee 2023). At 24 months, 62.4% (95% CI; 56.8-67.5) of the patients was alive without an event in the pembrollizumab + chemotherapy group, versus 40.6% (95% CI - 34.8-46.3) in the placebo group. The NADIM-II trial reported progression-free survival at 24 months. Progression-free survival was 67.2% (95% CI): 55.8-81.0) In the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group versus 40%.9% (95% CI The level of evidence regarding the outcome event-free survival was downgraded by two levels because of very wide confidence intervals that included the boundaries for clinical decision making (imprecision, one level) and potential publication bias (one level). A total of 1177 patients with completely resected stage IB-IIIA NSCLC (7th TNM classification) was randomized to receive adjuvant pembrolizumab (up to 18 cycles) (n=590) or placebo (n =587). Adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended but not mandatory. The medium follow-up was 35.6 months (IQR 27.1-45). Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) participated in study design, data analysis, data interpretation, and writing the report. They had no role in data collection. No other plausible sources of a risk of biased. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival. The IMpower010 trial showed less disease recurrence in the adjuvant atezolizumab group (187/507, 37%) compared to the best supportive care group (212/498, 43%) (HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.99) (Felip 2021). The PEARLS / KEYNOTE-091 trial found a medium disease-free survival of 53.6 months (95% CI 39.2 to not reached) in the adjunct pembrolizumab group compared to 42.0 months (95%CI 31.3 to not achieved) (hr: 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.91) (O.J.Brien 2022). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events Among patients treated with adjuvant atEZolizumab, 22% (108/495) experienced grade 3 or four adverse events compared to 12% (57/495) in its best career group (Frien 2022). The level of evidence regarding the outcome of adverse events was downgraded by two levels because of the absence of blinding in one trial and implied data for long-term adverse events (risk of bias, one level), and potential publication bias (one level). Wang searched PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase with relevant search terms until November 2021. The detailed search strategy is defined in the supplemental methods (Wang, 2022). Four of the 52 included studies were considered specific (NEOSTAR, CheckMate 816, IMpower010, PEARLS/KEYNOTE-091). On the 24th of February 2023, we performed a systematic search for systematic reviews and RCTs about early non-small cell cancer and immunotherapy in the databases Embase.com and Ovid/Medline. The search resulted in 223 unique hits and we screened publications published after the search date of Wang (2022). This search was located one additional RCT (NCT02904954).

The benefits, disadvantages and risks of both osimertinib and chemotherapy are known from the literature At present, only treatment with osimertinib is relevant for NSCLC patients with stage IB-IIIA and an EGFR mutation (ex19del or L858R) after complete resection and possibly adjuvanted chemotherapy. In the ADAURA study one examined the effect of adjuvant osimirtinib versus placebo in this setting. This study showed clinically relevant benefits: osimortinib may increase the 5-year survival (85%) compared to placebo (73%) (Tsuboi, 2023) and may result in a significantly longer disease-free survival and better CNS control. After 24 months, 89% of patients in the osimartinib group were infected, while this was 52% in the placebo group (Wu, 2022). On the basis of the study of Majem (2022) we concluded that there is probably no clinically relevant difference in quality of life between the groups. The outcome measures total survival and toxicity) and indirectness (no evidence for other means available in the Netherlands and/or other gene changes). Professional perspective From the survival data it appears that the patients in the study treated with osimertinib had a survival benefit compared to placebo. Although osimertinib could also be given on progression of disease, it therefore appears that after an early intervention survival gain occurs. In addition, prevention of disease progression with additional complaints is also relevant. For example, preventing brain metastases is an important contribution to the quality of life. This means that all pros and cons with the patients concerned should be discussed, but that adjuvant treatment should certainly be considered, regardless of the patient's age. Patient perspective, there are no additional considerations on the analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the working group. Acceptance, feasibility, implementation The working group considers osimirtinib as an acceptable intervention for all concerned who can be implemented. In the Pakket advice of Zorginstituut Nederland (link to advice), the cost effectiveness of adjuvant treatment with osimertinib after full tumour resection in adults with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer with tumours with EGFR mutations in the Netherlands has been investigated. Healthcare Institute Netherlands has concluded that adjuvant treatment using osimertinib is cost-effective compared to active monitoring; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 14,884 euro per QALY compared to the relevant reference value of 50,000 euro per qALY. Underbuilding Background In patients who have undergone a full resection of a non-minor cell lung carcinoma (Stage I-III), the MDO derivatives talk about which adjuvant therapy is relevant. In addition, the current (anno 2023) standard for patients with stage II-III adjuvant chemotherapy is used. Low GRADE Sources: (Wu, 2020; Herbst, 2023) Other adjuvant treatments No evidence is available regarding the effect of other adjuvant treatments available in the Netherlands or treatments for other variants. GRADE Source: (literature search, up to date till 27th of January 2023) Summary literature Summary of literature Description of studies Ou (2023) CORIN described a randomized, single-centre, open-label, phase II trial, with a median follow-up length of 39.9 months in China. They evaluated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant icotinib versus observation Not small cell lung cancer in patients with EGFR A total of 322 patients were randomized to receive icotinib (n=151) (125 mg thrice daily) or four cycles (21 days per cycle) for 24 months of vinorelbine (25 mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 8 of each cycle) plus cisplatin (75 mg/M2 IV upon day 1 of each cycle) to adenocarcinoma or squamous carcinoma; or intravenous pemetrexed 500 mg/ m2 plus cisplatin 75 mg/ M2 on day 1 every 3 weeks for non-squamous cancer (n=132). The median age (range) was 60 (52-64) in the icotinib group compared to 58 (51.5-63) in a chemotherapy group. In the icutinib group 77/151 (51%) were males, compared with 55/132 (42%) in the chemotherapy group (range). A total of 222 patients were randomized to receive gefitinib (n=111) (250 mg once daily) for 24 months or cisplatin (75 mg/m2 on day 1) plus vinorelbine (25 mg/M2 on days 1 and 8; cis/vin) once every 3 weeks for four cycles (n=16). They evaluated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant chemotherapy plus icotinib versus chemotherapy as postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with completely corrected stage IB-IIIA (edition TNM classification unclear) NSCLC harbouring an EGFR analogy. A total of 41 patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy plus icotinib (n=21) (125 mg, thrice daily; two weeks after finishing chemotherapy) for four to eight months, or until the occurrence of disease relapse, metastasis or unacceptable icotinib or chemotherapy toxicity or only chemotherapy (150 mg/m2/m2 nedaplatin or 30mg/m2 loplatin on day one of a three-week cycle) (n=12). The median duration of follow-up for OS in patients with stage II to IIIA disease was 59.9 months (range: 0 to 82) in the osimertinib group and 56.2 months ( range 1 to 86) in The placebo group. The 5-year overall survival was 85% (95% CI: 79% to 89) inthe osimertinib group, and 73% (95% CI; 66 to 78) inThe placebo group (HR 0.49; 95.03% CI: 0.33 to 0.73). In the osimertinib treated group there was no significant OS difference between those who received adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.16 (95%CI 0.10.26)) and those who did not (HR 0.23 (95%CI 0.03-0.40)). This HR and the confidence interval excessed the minimal clinically (patient) important difference of HR<0.6 Moreover, a major difference in brain metastasis incidence was found between osimertinib and placebo treated patients with a HR of 0.88 (95%CI 0.10-0.33). Herbst (2023) reported an updated exploration analysis of final DFS data. The median DFs was 65.8 months (95%CI 61.7 to could not be calculated) in the osimertinib group and 28.1 months (95% CI 22.1 to 35.0) in the placebo group. In the osimertinib group 94/339 (28%) patients had disease remission or died, compared with 211/343 (62%) patients in the placebo group. The percentage of patients who were alive and disease free at 48. Most common was pneumonia, reported in five (1%) patients in the osimertinib group and in four (1%) suffers in the placebo group (John, 2023). Level of evidence of the literature The evidence was brought from an RCT, there the level of evidence for all outcomes started at \"high'. The level of experience regarding the outcome overall survival was downgraded by two levels because of serious study limitations (-1 level for risk of bias, because of incomplete information about random Non small cell lung cancer sequence generation and allocation concealment and loss to follow-up) and imprecision (confidence interval cross the boundary of criminal decision making, i.e. P: patients with complete resistance, early-stage (I to III) pathologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a targetable gene alteration; I: adjuvant treatment specific for EGFR, ALK, RET, ROS1, BRAF, MET alterations; C: chemotherapy or placebo; O: overall survival, disease-free survival, response rate, adverse events, quality of life. Relevant outcome measures The guideline development group considered overall survival and disease- free survival as critical outcome measures for decision making; and quality of existence and toxicity as important outcomes for decisionmaking. After reading the full text and thus assessment of the studies, 23 studies were excluded (no RCTs, no outcome of interest and inefficient information after reviewing the full Text), and nine RCT's were included (Tada, 2021; He, 2021, Wu, 2020; Zhong, 2018, 2021; Yue, 2018; Kelly, 2015; Feng, 2015, Li, 2013; Goss, 2013). An overview of all the included RCTS in the systematic review can be found in table 1. On the 27th of January 2023, we performed a systematic search for systematic reviews and RACTs about NSCLC and approximate therapy for patients with EGFR, ALK, RET, ROS1, BRAF, WITH translations in the databases Embase.com and Ovid/Medline. 2 - Goss GD, O'Callaghan C, Lorimer I, Tsao MS, Masters GA, Jett J, Edelman MJ, Lilenbaum R, Choy H, Khuri F, Pisters K, Gandara D, Kernstine K, Butts C, Noble J, Hensing TA, Rowland K, Schiller J, Ding K, Shepherd FA.

Recommendation Treatment of the following patients with duvalumab preferably within 6 weeks of completion of competing chemo-radiotherapy for 12 months: with stage III irresectable non-small cell lung cancer regardless of PD-L1 status and; in good condition (WHO performance status 0 to 1 after completion of chemoradiotherapy) and; who do not show disease progression on completion of competitor chemo radiotherapy on a CT with intravenous contamination of the thorax and upper abdominal and; no contra-indication of immunotherapy. Treat patients with Stage III non- small cell lung carcinoma was not studied with tecemotide after competitor chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Considerations Advantages and disadvantages of intervention and evidence Two randomised phase III studies were found that examined the effects of chemotherapy therapy and radiology at stage III NSCLC. Immunotherapy was different in the two studies: in the PACIFIC-trial were the anti-PD-L-1 checkpoint durvalumab after competing chemotherapy, while in the STAR-T The results of the quality of life of the PACIFIC trial were published after the search date the literature search (Hui, 2019). Durvalumab did not appear to have a negative effect on the QoL compared to placebo. These results were not yet published at the time of writing of this directive. Evidence is average for outcomes survival, progression-free survival, response rate and safety (adverse effects and toxicity) for the comparison durvalumab versus placebo after competing chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This means that it is likely that duringvalumab after competingchemotherapy and radiation therapy results in increased survival, progressive survival and response rate (follow-up 2 years), while adverse reactions are similar. The evidence is low for outcome survival for the equation tecemotide versus placebo after competitive chemotherapy, and radiology and very low for the outcome side effects. In the Netherlands, all conditions are met to effectively implement durvalumab after competing chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Since durvallumab should begin within 6 weeks of the last radiotherapy, it is desirable to plan the CT scan within 3 weeks and preferably after the end of radiotherapy as soon as possible. Radiotherapy often causes several changes in the lungs and in the tumor and/or irradiated glands that are difficult to interpret. Therefore, deviations in the thorax to the contrary are shown as post-radiotherapy findings. Additional investigations are only rarely necessary. The CT scan of thorac and upper abdominal contrast is performed with intravenous contrast, unless there is a contra-indication. This CT scan is an additional study that should be carried out and where sufficient capacity on the radiology is found to be given together with region. Recommendation-1 Rationale/ balance between the arguments for and against the intervention administration of 12 months of durvalumab within 6 weeks of competing chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients in a good condition (WHO performance status 0 to 1) and without disease progression with a stage III NSCLC (regardless of PD-L1 status) probably results in a clinically relevant profit in survival, progression-free survival and a good response rate (follow-up 2 years), while side effects are similar to placebo. Therefore, the working group believes that this treatment can be recommended. Recommendation-2 Rationale / balance between arguments for or against intervention Due to lack of studies with high probative strength and premature discontinuation of a study, due to adverse reactions in another indication area, the group considers that it is too early to recommend tecemotide after competing chemotherapy and radiology. Adjuvantdurvalumab after competitor chemoradiotherapy results in an increased response Moderate rate compared to placebo in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer GRADE Sources: (Antonia, 2017; Antonia 2018) The safety (adverse events and toxicity) of adjuvant darvalumab afterwards competitor chemoradiotherapy therapy is compatible with placebo in patient with advanced Non-small Cell Moderate lung cancer GRADE Source: (Antonia, 2017); Antonia 2018) Adjuvant tecemotide versus placebo Adjuvitt tecemotide after chemorradiotherapy does possible not result in a higher chance of overall survival compared to placebo in patient stage III non-smal lung cancer. The median followup time was 58.7 months in the tecemotide group and 57.3 months in a placebo group for overall survival (Mitchell, 2015). Other outcomes were reported at a follow-up of 39.9 months in The TECemotide Group and 37.7 months on the placebo group. In March 2010, clinical trials of tecemicotide, including the START-trial, were put on hold for deployment and treatment after a case of encephalitis occured in a phase 2 trial of tecemotide for multiple myeloma. In patients with a PD-L1 expression level of < 25% 74 of the 187 (39.6%) died in thedurvalumab group versus 41 of the 105 (39%) in the placebo group (HR for death 0.92 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.34)) Patients with aPD-L 1 expression level or ≥25% 37 of the 115 (32.2%) died in The Durvalumab Group versus 23 of the 44 (52.3%) in the Placebo group. 2. Progression free survival The median progression free survival (PFS) in The PACIFIC study (co-primary endpoint of the study) was 17.2 months (95% CI 13.1 to 23.9) in the durationumab group vs 5.6 month (95% CI 4.6 to 7.7) inthe placebo group. Treatment related grade 3 or 4 adverse events occured in 56 (11.8%) patients in thedurvalumab group versus 10 (4.4%) in the placebo group (RR 2.76 (95% CI 1.43 to 5.31)) Level of evidence comparison durvalumab versus placebo There are four levels of evidence: high, moderate, low, and very low. RCTs start at a high level of evidence. The level of quality of evidence for the outcome overall survival and toxicity was downgraded with 1 level from high to moderate because of impact of results (total number of patients < 2000 per group).

References Starting question What is the place of immunotherapy or a combination of immunotherapeutic and chemotherapy in the first line treatment (primary treatment) of patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. Recommendation The following recommendations apply to patients with non-curative treatment NSCLEC, performance score 0-1, no contra-indications for immunotherapy and without molecular abbreviation for which a targeted therapy is available (see module \"Plavesel cell NSclC' with rare mutation \") Treat patients with PD-L1 ≥50% primary or pembrozumab monotherapy, independent of Enteric subtype. If the patient does not have a good Non-small cell lung cancer performance status (ECOG PS ≤1), asymptomatic or treated stable brain metastases for which no dexamethasone is required with a dose equivalent of >10mg prednisone, no predictive mutation in EGFR, ALK, BRAF ROS1, and no other hard contra-indications for immunotherapy should be considered as monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy as an option for first line treatment. Furthermore, there are still a number of mutations and gene fusions/rearrangements such as BRAF-V600E, ROS1 and RET for which very effective TKIcosamides are available and where the effect of immunotherapy is less well investigated. In such cases, an expertise centre should be consulted on the treatment of first preference and if necessary referral. In particular pembrolizumab and atezolizumab are the immunotherapeutic agents for which a clinically relevant effect on progression free survival and overall survival is demonstrated. In this study, chemotherapy (carboplatin + paclitax cell or nab-paclitaxel) was also compared with placebo with the same chemotherapy with pembrolizumab. A clinically relevant benefit was seen in relation to overall survival for the group treated with the pembrilizumab combination (HR for death 0.64; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85). This is particularly true for subgroups with a PD-L1 TPS <1% and 1-49%. For the subgroup with a PDBroli1/2006 combination ( HR for progression or death 0.56; 95% CI 3.5 to 0.70). For progression free survival, the working group has been seen a clinically relevant advantage in the group that was treated with pembrolizumab combination. The results of this study were considered to be of such relevance to this group, that despite the fact that the study was published after the search date, the working group nevertheless considered that treatment with carboplatin plus paclitaxel combined with pembrolizumab should be the preferred treatment for this group of patients with a squamous cell NSCLC. Even if there is a PD-L1 TPS <1%, tumor histology is of importance. For the non-plamous Cell NSClC, the Keynote-189 study (Ghandi, 2018) showed no significant benefit in terms of progression free survival (HR for progression or death 0.57 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.05) but for overall survival ( HR for death 0.59 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.92). In the IMpower150 study (Socinski, 2018), in the group with negative PD- L1 expression on both tumour cells was considered as a significant benefit to the group of this group and to be considered as being of this category. In them, therefore, there is more chance to benefit from the treatment of the combination with chemotherapy and immunotherapy than thought on the basis of predictive markers.Another argument is that of all patients receiving chemotherapy as a first-line treatment more than half is no longer due to a form of tumor-oriented second-line therapy and therefore not to the potential benefits of immunotherapy (Davies, 2017; Lazzari, 2017). Nevertheless, the evidence for adding immunotherapy to treatment in this patient category is limited and chemotherapy treatment alone is certainly also a good option to be discussed with patient.For the squamous celly NSCLC with a PD-L1 TPS <1% there was no longer any evidence at the time of cutting off the literature search for this directive to show a clinical added value of immunotherapeutic in any form with chemtherapy. Here too, the results of the keynote 407 study (Paz-Ares, 2018) could not be included in the systematic analysis. In specific cases and in consultation with the patient, one of the combinations with immunotherapy chemotherapy is available for this group of patients with non-squamous NSCLC with a PD-L1 TPS of 1-49%. Although there is sufficient evidence that treatment with a combination of immunotherapy-chemotherapy is more effective than platinum-containing combination chemotherapy alone, there is no direct comparison between the two immunotherapy chemical regimens. Therefore, there was no hard ruling on which combination should be preferred. In the IMpower 150 study, patients in the maintenance phase with atezolizumab/bevacizumab were treated to disease progression or not acceptable. In both the keynote 189 and keynote 407 study, the maintenance stage with pembrolizumab was 2 years. However, the working group considers that treatment with chemotherapy should be considered and/or discussed in patients with an ECOG performance score of 2. The working group believes that in an ECEG performance rating of 3 or 4 best supportive care the treatment is preferable. Also patients with underlying autoimmune disease were in most cases excluded from participation in the trials with immunotherapy or combination immunotherapy chemotherapy as first line treatment. About this subgroup of patients is not randomised data for hands. Retrospective case series do however provide support for the assumption that also in a part of this subgroup patients treatment with PD-L1 or PD- L1 inhibition can be safe (Leonardi, 2018). The working party believes that for these patients an individual consideration will be made on the basis of characteristics of patient, tumor and nature of the auto-immune disease. Values and preferences of patients (and possibly their carers) Patients and their associations would like to be treated by experts in the lung cancer field, for example by lung oncologens. A lower price of immunotherapeutic medicinal products in all respects would be highly desirable and even necessary by the working group, including in view of the upcoming developments and the affordability and assurance of good quality of care in the near future. This opinion is shared by the patient association. An adequate predictive PD-L1 test is necessary for a good choice of optimal treatment. The cost of this test is significantly higher than diagnostic immune histochemistry. This test is not carried out small cell lung cancer in all patients with NSCLC who may be eligible for treatment with immunotherapy. In its totality, it involves a significant increase in the cost of pathological diagnostics. For this purpose, sufficient budget should be made available. To optimize the cost effectiveness of immunotherapy in current practice are both the prescribing of a fixed dosage independent of body weight, as an extension of the dosing interval. In addition, the pharmacological exposure at a fixed dose does not appear to be less than a dose based on body weight and can lead to a reduction, among other things. From the patient's perspective of availability of care, it is necessary to create more centres where immunotherapy can be given for the first line treatment of NSCLC, so that the capacity in the existing centres will not be sufficient to treat all patients. From the social tendency and professional desire to reduce the registration burden, it seems to the working group strongly to consider strictly limiting the additional requirements relating to registration applicable to the use of immunotherapy to that which contributes to improving safety and quality of care. Feasibility and implementation For the implementation of immunotreatment in the first-line treatment of the NS CLC is a requirement in the short term extension of treatment capacity at all levels. This applies à fortiori when the indication areas are extended, as is expected in the near term. If this does not happen, the accessibility of care to patients with incurable NSclC may be compromised. This requires expansion and improvement of the organization within the treatment hospitals, but also an increasing degree of organization within current regions and networks. For this purpose, a positive opinion has been issued by the Commission BOM. For the combination of platinum-paclitaxel-atezolizumab and pembrolizumab monotherapy, a benefit has been demonstrated in patients with non-plaveise cell NSCLC in all patients with a moderate to low probative strength. For specific patient groups with a non-curative treatment NSClC in any of the patients with pembrilizumab alone, a combination of plainum-pemetrexed-pembrolizumab, a combined chemotherapy or platinum-doublet chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab is also available in all of the subjects with a pembrelizumab-pembrolízumab alone or in the patient group with a tumour PD-L1 TPS ≥50%. For this benefit, a favourable opinion has not been given by the BOM Committee. It is very likely that the toxicity of treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy is lower than the treatment with the mentioned chemo-immunotherapy combinations. In addition, there is a lower cost. The available data is vulnerable to bias and obtained in a selected patient group with very good performance, without (symptomatic) brain metastases or active autoimmune disease and in almost all trials included patients with tumours with an activating EGFR mutation and ALK translocation. Only in the Socinski study, a small number of patients with a activating ECFR mutation and an ECOG performance score ≥2 or active car-immune diseases are excluded from treatment with a TKI no longer available. Conclusions Pembrolizumab versus platinum-doublet chemotherapy Pembrelizumab results in a clinically relevant higher chance of overall survival compared to chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer and a PD-L1 tumor Moderate proportion score ≥50%, independent of tumour histology. GRADE References: (Reck, 2016) Pembrollizumab outcomes in a clinically relevant longer progression compared to chemistry in patient with advanced Non-small cell lung cancer &amp; a PD -L1 tumour Moderate proposition score ≥500%, dependent of tumour history GRADE References: (Reck, 2016). GRADE Reference: (-) The safety (adverse events and toxicity) of pembrolizumab with chemotherapy is possible compatible with chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small-low cell lung cancer. GRADE Reference: (Gandhi, 2018; Langer, 2016) Ipilimumab plus chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel) versus chemotherapy (carbosplatin/paccitaxel) The overall survival of ipilimazepine plus chemotherapy is possible comparable with Low chemotherapy alone in patient with advanced squamous Non-small cell cancer. GRADE References: (-) Nivolumab resulting in less treatment-related adverse events compared with chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer and PD-L1 tumor proportion score Moderate ≥1%, but this difference was not clinically relevant. GRADE References: (Carbone, 2017; Hellmann, 2018) Nivolimab plus ipilimumab versus platinum-doublet chemotherapy Cause of a slack of data (not reported), it was not possible to compare the overall survival - of nivolumab plus ifilimumab with chemotherapy. GRADE References: (-) We are uncertain whether nivol TARGET plus ipelimumab results in a higher progression free survival rate compared to chemotherapy at patients with disease. GRADE Referrals: (-) ABCP potentially results in more Grade 3 and 4 treatment-related adverse events compared to BCP in patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer but this Low difference was not clinically relevant. The incidence of any treatment-associated adverse event GRADE is possibly comparable for the two treatment options. Reference: (Socinski, 2018) Summary literature Description studies A total of 9 articles of 8 studies were considered suitable to be included in this literature summary comparing therapies. Two articles (Brahmer, 2017; Reck, 2016) explained different outcomes of the KEYNOTE- 024 study. The included studies assessed the following immunotherapy; pembrolizumab with a dose of 1,2 Table 1 Details of the included studies Study Design Patients Intervention Control Reck, 2016 Open 305 stage IV NSCLC (squamous and Pembrolizumab Chemotherapy label nonsquaMous) with a PD-L1 tumor proportion Brahmer, 2017 RCT, score of 50% or greater (KEYNOTE-phase 3 Langer, 2016 open 123 stage IIIB or IV nonsquamous NSCLEC (KEYNOYE-blind 189) RCT. The hazard ratio (HR) for death was 0.60 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.89), meaning that patients in the pembrolizumab group had a higher chance of overall survival compared to patients in a chemotherapy group. 2. Progression free survival Reck (2016) reported progress free survival in a total of 305 patients. The median progression free survival was 10.3 months in the tembrolizumab versus 6.0 months in a Chemotherapy group in patients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 50% or greater. The pooled HR for progression or death was 0.50 (95%CI 0.37 to 0.68), meaning the patient group in the fembroli1/2006 group had an upperchance of free survival compared with 50% or larger. In the chemotherapy arm hematologic adverse events as well as nausea and vomiting were seen more frequently than in the pembrolizumab arm. In the pembrolizumab arm immune mediated adverse events like thyroiditis, pneumonitis and dermatitis were seen much more frequently. Level of evidence compare pembrelizumab versus chemotherapy There are four levels of evidence: high, moderate, low, and very low. RCTs start at a high level of evidence. The level of quality of evidence for the outcome overall survival was downgraded with 1 level from high to moderate because of imprecision (overlap with the border of clinic and total number of patients <2000 per group). The pooled HR for death was 0.59 (95% CI 0.34 to 1.93), meaning that patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group had a higher chance of overall survival compared to patients in The chemotherapy Group (figure 1). Figure 1 Overall survival pembrelizumab with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy Z: p-value of overall effect; df: degrees of freedom; 2I: statistical heterogeneity; CI: confidence interval Ghandi (2018) reported that the benefit of the pembrolizumab combination regarding overall survival was observed in all subgroups of PD-L1 tumour proposition score, but the benefit was higher with a higher PD- L1 TPS (for Tumour Score); for those with a PD-l1 tumor proposition score of less than 1%. Longer (2016) did not report results for PD-L1 subgroups. 3. Response rate Two studies (Ghandi, 2018; Langer, 2016) reported the response rate according in a total of 701 patients. The response rate was 48.5% in the pembrolizumab group plus chemotherapy versus 21.7% in the chemotherapy group (RR 2.27; 95% CI 1.76 to 2.93) (Figure 3). Figure 3 Response rate pembrelizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy Z: p-value of overall effect; df: degrees of freedom; 2I: statistical heterogeneity; CI: confidence interval Ghandi (2018) reported a higher response rate in the PMbrolizumab combination than in the Chemotherapy group all categories of PD- L1 tumor proposition score, with the difference in proportion to 50%. In 6.7% (n=27) of the patients in the pembrolizumab group plus chemotherapy versus 5.9% (n=12) in the chemotherapy group the adverse event led to death. 99% adverse events occured in the tembrolizumab combination group versus 97% in the chemistry group (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.02). 63.6% grade 3, 4, or 5 treatment-related adverse events adverse events occurred in the fembrolizumab combination Group versus 56.4% in the Chemotherapy group (TR 1.14; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.63) (Ghandi, 2018; Langer, 2016), figure 4 Safety (adverse events and toxicity) pembrelizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy Z: p-value of overall effect; df: degrees of freedom; 2 Govindan (2017) was only included squamous NSCLC patients who were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive carboplatin and paclitaxel plus blinded ipilimumab 10mg/kg or placebo every three weeks on a phased induction schedule. The patients with stable disease or better after induction treatment were treated with maintenance lipilimumab or placebo every 12 weeks. Govin Dan (2017) reported the percentage alive at 1 year, which was 54% in the ipilimpumab group versus 53% in the chemotherapy group and respectively 24% and 18% after 2 years. In the study of Lynch (2012), the average survival was 9.7 months in the competitor ipilimimumab group, 12.2 months in the phased ipilimatumab group and 8.3 months at the chemotherapy group and mainly 24% and 18 percent after 2 year. Safety (adverse events and toxicity) Two studies comparing ipilimumab plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy reported treatment-related adverse events (Govindan, 2017; Lynch, 2012) in a total of 952 patients. Approximately 95.4% of the patients in the ipilymumab group versus 92.1% of the sufferers in the chemotherapy group had adverse events [RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.17], favoring chemotherapy (figure 7), however Lytch, 2012 reported the number of Grade 1, 2, 3 and 4 events. Nivolumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy 1. Overall survival (critical outcome) One study compared nivolumab with chemotherapy and reported on overall survival (Carbone, 2017). 541 patients with squamous and non-squamous NSCLC, an ECOG performance status score of 0 to 1 and a PD-L1 TPS ≥1% were randomly assigned to receive nivolovir or chemotherapy (1:1). The paper reported on overall survival in the group of patients with a PD -L1TPS ≥5% (n=223). The percentage of patients using a PD‐L1 expression level of ≥5% alive at 1 year was 56% in the nilumab group versus 54% in the chemotherapy group. The median survival was 14.4 months and 13.2 months, respectively. Figure 9 Progression free survival (HR for progression or death) nivolumab versus chemotherapy Z: p-value of overall effect; df: degrees of freedom; 2I: statistical heterogeneity; CI: confidence interval 3. Response rate One study (Carbone, 2017) compared nivolimab with chemotherapy and reported the response rate in a total of 223 patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5%. The response rate was 26% in the nivolBV group versus 33% in the chemotherapy group (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.00), favoring chemotherapy. In an exploratory subgroup analysis involving patients with any PD- L1 expression level of 50% or more, the response rates were 34% in the Nivolumab group (N=88 patients) and 39% in the chemistry group (n=126 to 1.09). The level of quality of evidence for the outcome measures progress free survival and response rate was downgraded with 3 levels from high to very low because of limitations in the study design such as unclear allocation concealment, slack of blinding and violation of the intent to treat analysis (risk of bias), inconsistency of results (variance of point estimates across studies) and imprecision (confidence interval crossing threat for no difference). As none of the included studies reported data on the quality of life, it was not possible to assess the level of evidence. Among patients with a low tumor proportional burden (<10 variants per megabase), the median progressionfree survival was 3.2 months with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 5.5 months with chemotherapy (HR 1.07; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.35). The study protocol was amended after enrollment of all patients had been completed (but before primary database lock) to include tumor similar burden based efficacy analyses. Subgroup analysis among the in the initial protocol not pre-specified subgroup of patients with high TMB according to PD-L1 status showed that progression-free survival had longer with ni volumab plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy among patients with any PD- L1 expression level of at least 1% (HR for progression or death 0.22 (95% CI.44 to 0.88) with 0. The level of quality of evidence for the other outcome measures was downgraded with 3 levels from high to very low, because of limitations in the study design such as slack of blinding, loss to follow-up and selective outcome reporting (risk of bias) and imprecision (limited number of patients). Atezolizumab, bevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel (ABCP) versus bevacízumab, carboplatin and Paclitaxel, (BCP) 1. After a protocol explanation One study compared ABCP with BCP in a total of 800 nonsquamous NSCAC patients with an ECOG performance status score of 0 to 1 (Socinski, 2018). Response rate One study (Socinski, 2018) compared ABCP with BCP and reported the response rate in a total of 692 patients in the WT population. The response rate was 63.5% in the ABCP group versus 48.0% in the BCP group (RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.52), favoring ABCP. In the Teff-high WT popularity the response rating was 69.3% in the BCP Group (106 of the 153) versus 53.5% in The BCP Group (68 of the 127) (RR 1.29 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.57). Quality of life The included studies comparing ABCP to BCP did not report on quality of life.

P (population) patients with Non-povercell cancer stageIII/IV The systematic literature search resulted in 86 hits. Studies were selected based on the following criteria: systematic review or randomized trials including patients with non-protective cell lung cancer stage IIIB/IV without sensitizing oncogene driver variants and comparing immunotherapy with PD-1-, PD-L1- and CTLA4 inhibitors (with or without chemotherapy) with chemotherapy. 43 studies were initially selected based upon title and abstract. After reading the full text, 34 studies were excluded (see the table with answers for exclusion under the tab Methods), and nine articles were definitely included in the literature summary. Examples of this include KEAP1 and STK11, although their exact value is still subject to investigation and there is no prospective study of these specific comutations. Also, a direct comparison with chemoimmune therapy has not taken place. In the CheckMate 9LA study, most benefits of the nevertheless heavy and toxic treatment were obtained in the somewhat younger patient (at least under 75 years) with a smoke history. Patients with liver metastases did worse on treatment. The 9LA schedule is a good alternative to the standard treatment in this group of patients, namely platinum doublet chemotherapy and pembrolizumab and can be considered for selected patients. Advantages known from the literature The CheckMata 9LA trial shows a clinically relevant difference for overall survival in the benefit of dual immune therapy with chemotherapy in fit patients with a metastatic NSCLC without an EGFR mutation or ALK-recast.",

      "text": "The adverse reactions appear to be similar to those seen in monoimmune therapy (Gandhi, 2018; Paz-Ares, 2021; Reck, 2016; Socinski, 2018). The adverse events profile requires attention. Literature evidence The working group concludes that the evidence for the effect of double immune therapy in combination with chemotherapy in the Netherlands for patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma with stage IIIB/C/IV without EGFR mutation or ALK re-arrangement is very low. This means that the actual effect may be substantially different from the effect from the one in the study. Methodological limitations (in particular indirectness) are based on this. Professional perspective For the PD-L1 <1%, randomized data are not available. The effect of monoimmune treatment for this group is very small and is not advised. The standard treatment for the group is chemoimmune therapy. There are indications that the 9LA scheme is a relevant survival benefit for a selected population. The 9LA schedule of dual immune therapy is more toxic than standard chemoimmune therapy. Acceptance, feasibility, implementation The working group assesses double immune therapy in combination with chemotherapy as an acceptable intervention for all concerned who can be implemented directly. This treatment can be given within regular care, in the dual immune treatment centres. Costs According to the NVMO commission BOM advice costs the treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab per 6 weeks administration respectively 7946,64 euro and 7125,30 euro (at a weight of 70 kg) (NVMO committee for Evaluation of Oncological Resources, 2021).The price per treatment (including 2 cycles chemotherapy with pemetrexed) comes out at approximately 70,000 euro (median treatment duration 6.1 months).The rate per treatment in the control group comes out to approximately 16,000 euro (mediated treatment duration 2.4 months) (Commission BOM, 2021, o.v. data of drug costs.nl). Very low GRADE Source: Paz-Ares, 2021; Reck, 2021 Response rate и PD-L1<1% Nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus chemotherapy may have a positive impact on objective response rate compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC with a PD- L1<1%), but the evidence is very uncertain. Very low GRADE Source is: Paze-Aras, 2021, 2021. Paz-Ares (221) / Reck (2021) / Reck (2023) . CheckMate 9LA described a randomized, open-label, international, multi-center phase III trial. The results of the first interim analysis (Paz-Ares, 2021; mediumn follow-up of 9.7 months) were followed by a 2-year update of efficacy and safety (Reck, 2021) and quality of life (Rck, 2023; mediumn monitor of 30.7 months). A 4-year update is expected to be published in 2023. They evaluated the efficacy and safety of first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in patients with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC. A total of 719 patients was randomized to receive the medication (360 mg every 3 weeks). Results Nivolumab plus ipilimumab with chemotherapy Currently, treatment with nivolumab + ipilinumab is the only available dual immunotherapy treatment in the Netherlands for patients with NSCLC stage IIIB/C/IV without sensitizing oncogenic driver translations. In practice, immunotherapy is combined with chemotherapy to accelerate the effect. Therefore, the analysis of outcomes below is restricted to the CheckMate 9LA results in which the intervention consents of nivolBV, ipilimpumab and chemotherapy and the control of chemotherapy alone. In the 2-year update, the median PFS in patients with a PD-L1 expression level of <1% was 5.8 months (95% CI: 4.4 to 7.6) in the dual immunotherapy plus CT group and 4.9 months (95%CI: 4.2 to 5.7) in The CT group with a minimum follow-up of 23.3 months (Reck, 2021). The hazard ratio was 0.68 (95%CI - 0.51 to 0.89) in the favor of the dual immune therapy group. As the median overall survival in the control group was <12 months, the clinical relationship of PFS was not considered. The 2023 ASCO meeting abstract of the 4-year results reported an PFS rate of 12% for the dual Immunotherapy plus the CT group versus 3% in the CT Group for the PD- L1 <1% cohort (Carbone, 2023). The difference between treatments was 0.029 (95% CI: -0.001 to 0.059) in favour of the dual immunotherapy plus CT group (Reck, 2023). * The PD-L1 status was quantitative for 338 out of 361 patients (94%) in the dual immune therapy group, and in 333 out of 358 patients (93%) in the control group. PD- L1 expression on hopeless tumour cells was assigned with immunohistochemical 28-8 pharmDx assay (Paz- Ares, 2021). Level of evidence of the literature The evidence for the outcomes of life at OS, PFS and ORR was derived from observational data from subgroups of an RCT, there was the level of evidence started at . Therefore, the level of Niet kleincellig longcarcinoma evidence was graduated as very low. Zoeken en selecten A systematic review of the literature was formulated to answer the following question: What are the effects of first-line dual immunotherapy with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy, single immunotherapy or a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without sensitizing oncogenic driver analogys? P: patients with Non-protective cell cancer (NSCLC) stage IIIB/C/IV without sensitising oncogene drivers Studies were selected based on the following criteria: The study population had to meet the criteria as defined in the PICO; The intervention and comparison had to be defined in The PICO and reported at least one of the outcomes as determined in the PICO; Research type: Systematic review; RCT; Articles write in English or Dutch. The working group decided not to expand the search with observational studies. This would result in a disproportionate amount of extra work, without expected added value for the conclusion. Moreover, the working group was not aware of any relevant cohorts. The 115 articles from the systematic review were screened on title and abstract, from which 18 were initially selected. The survival and quality of life of patients eligible for second-line treatment is still limited, despite the recent progress made. Discuss with patients eligible to second-lines treatment also the possibility of supportive palliative care. Considerations The following considerations and recommendations apply to the vast majority of the population to which the initial demand relates. Pros and cons of intervention and the quality of evidence The optimal choice of second- line treatment at stage IV NSCLC patient is highly dependent on tumour characteristics, first-line therapy and performance score of the patient. Also, it is important to include the expected quality of living in the considerations. The individual studies examined have been conducted in subgroups and in highly selected patients. Therefore, it's not small-cell lung cancer commands a certain degree of caution in the interpretation of the results and forecasts. Head-to-head studies between the various recently developed resources and strategies are absent. Values and preferences of patients (and possibly their caregivers) Patients and their associations of interests like to be treated by experts in the field of lung cancer, for example by pulmonary oncologists. Accessibility and proximity of good lung oncology care for patients in all regions is important, especially for elderly and patients in less condition. Cost (possession) The price level in 2019 shows that immunotherapeutics are more expensive than regular chemotherapy. However, the price level is not clear by price agreements with the government. From a medical, political and social angle however, the current price of the new means is acceptable for use in practice. A lower price of immunotherapeutic drugs would be desirable for the whole society. Also the patient association shares this opinion. On the basis of the CieBOM advice is for the Pembrolizumab in the 2nd line the advice is only to use it at a PD-L1 value of 50% or more. Since a predictive PD- L1 test for the use of this means is necessary, the costs should also be taken. In addition, the registration pressure is an important obstacle.Other quality criteria may be a possible limitation for implementation, but in order to guarantee the highest possible quality, it is advisable to ensure this in regional networks. Rationale/ balance between the arguments for and against intervention Based on the available data, with low probative power, there is an advantage for patients treated with nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab monotherapy in the second line compared to treatment with Docetaxel. Available data is vulnerable to bias and obtained exclusively in a sore fit and selected population. Available dates show that there are fewer treatment related adverse events in immunotherapy than in chemotherapy, the data available on the quality of life is even more limited, however, this shows a similar (atezolizumab), or better quality of living (nivolumab) than chemotherapy. Underbuilding Background The second line treatment in non-small lung carcinoma is variable. GRADE References: (Horn, 2017; Huang, 2018; Vokes, 2018) Nivolumab potentially results in a higher response rate compared to chemotherapy in Low patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer after first line chemotherapy. GRADE Reference: (Horn, 2017, Huang; 2018; vokes,2018) Ni volumab potentially outcomes in a better, not clinically relevant, quality of life compared to chemistry in patients with Advanced non-mall-cell cancer after the first line Low chemotherapy GRADE References: (Fehrenbacher, 2018; Huang, 2018) Atezolizumab potentially results in a higher progression free survival compared to chemotherapy in PD-L1 positive patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer after Low first line chemotherapy. GRADE References: (Fehrenbachers, 2018); Huang; 2018) The progress free survival of atezoli1/2006 is potentially comparable with chemotherapy at PD- L1 negative patients with developed non-mall-cell cancer after first line Low chemotherapy The median follow-up was 13.1 months in the KEYNOTE 010 trial, 14.8 months in The OAK trial and 14.8 years in the POPLAR trial. In addition to the results reported in Huang (2018), the impact of immunotherapy and docetaxel on health Niet kleincellig longcarcinoma related quality of life was reported in patients attending the CheckMate-017 (Reck, 2017), CheckMata-057 (Reck, 2018) and the OAK trials (Bordoni, 2018). Horn (2017) and Vokes (2018) provided respectfully 2-years and 3-years results of the CheckMate 017 and CheckMates-057 trials. The median overall survival was 12.2 months for nivolumab versus 9.4 months for docetaxel in the CheckMate 057 trial and 9.2 months to 6.0 months in the checkMate 017 trial. The pembrolizumab pooled HR for death was 0.66 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.77) compared to chemotherapy. The median overall survival was 10.4 months in The pembrolizumab (2mg) group, 12.7 months in the pembrilizumab (10mg) Group and 8.5 months in a docetaxel group. The HR for atezolizumab showed improvement in overall survival for atezolizumab (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85). The average survival was 13.8 months for atesolizumab versus 9.6 months for docetec in the OAK trial and 12.6 months in its trial and previous trial. The HRs for nivolumab and atezolizumab showed improvement in overall survival about docetaxel in PD-L1 negative patients, but the differences were not clinically relevant (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.49 to 1.15 (nivolumab) and HR 0.81; 0.62 to 1.07 atezolazumab) (Figure 3).

Figure 4 Progression free survival (HR for progression or death) immunotherapy versus chemotherapy Z: p-value of overall effect; df: degrees of freedom; I2: statistical heterogeneity; CI: confidence interval Differences in progress free rates, which favored nivolumab over docetaxel, were consistent at 1 and 2 years in patients (Horn, 2017: CheckMate 017 and CheckMATE 057). At 3 years maar minimum follow-up the pooled progression free survival rates were 10% in the nivolfuran group versus <1% in the chemotherapy group (Vokes, 2018: Checkmate 011 and Checkmote 057) The HR of progress free survival in the OAK trial after an additional 7-months was followed by the following the results in 0 The combined response rate was 19.2% in the nivolumab group versus 11% in the chemotherapy group (RR 1.73; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.42). Also patients receiving pembrolizumab group had a higher clinical response rate compared to patients receiving chemotherapy, with a pooled response rate of 18.2% in The pembrelizumab Group versus 9.3% in The chemotherapy Group (RR 1.95; 95% CI 1,47 to 2.59). No difference were found between patients receiving atezolizumab or docetaxel. The response rate is 13.8% in the atezolizumab groups versus 13.7% in the chemistry group (TR1.01; 95% CI1, 1.47 to Figure 5 Response rate immunotherapy versus chemotherapy Z: p-value of overall effect; df: degrees of freedom; 2I: statistical heterogeneity; CI: The HR for time to deterioration in health-related quality of life was 0.94 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.24), favoring atezolizumab. The atezolizumab-treated patients reported numerically improved HRQoL from baseline starting at cycle 3 and continuing until cycle 13. 5. Safety (adverse events and toxicity) All five trials comparing immunotherapy with chemotherapy reported treatment-related adverse events. Patients receiving nivolumab had a clinically relevant difference of 26% less adverse events (RR) compared to patients with chemotherapy (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.64) to 0.86). Nivolumab The level of quality of evidence for the outcome of overall survival, response rate and quality of life was downgraded with 2 levels from high to low because of imprecision of results (overlap with the border of clinical relevance). Relevant outcome measures The working group considered overall survival a critical outcome measure for the decision making process; and progress free survival, response rate, quality of life, safety (adverse events and toxicity) important outcomes for decision making.The working group defined clinically relevant differences as follow: Overall survival: >12 weeks or hazard ratio <0.7 Progression free survival:>12 weeks, or hazard ratios <0.7 Adverse events and toxicity: References 1 - Horn L, Spigel DR, Vokes EE, Holgado E, Ready N, Steins M, Poddubskaya E, Borghaei H, Felip E, Paz-Ares L, Pluzanski A, Reckamp KL, Burgio MA, Kohlhäeufl M, Waterhouse D, Barlesi F, Antonia S, Arrieta O, Fayette J, Crinò L, Rizvi N, Reeck M, Hellmann MD, Geese WJ, Li A, Blackwood-Chirchir A, Healey D, Brahmer J, Eberhardt WEE. Nivolumab Versus Docetaxel in Previously Treated Patients With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Two-Year Outcomes From Two Randomized, Phase III Trials (CheckMate 01 and CheckMate 057). This is also supported by the relatively good overall survival in the docetaxel arm of the CodeBreak 200 study after chemoimmune therapy in  Kras G12c mutated patients (11.3 months, 95% CI 9.0-14.9 months) (De Langen, 2023) (see module \"Incurable NSCLC treatment with (rare) mutations for the extensive description).After the search date for the literature summary (April 2023), at least two relevant RCTs were published comparing immunotherapy to docetaxel after previous treatment with immune therapy.In phase 3 SAPPHIRE study, total survival for the combination of sitravatinib with nivolumab with ni volumab was not significantly better than for docetaxel (Borghaei, 2023). In phase 3 CONTACT-01 trial, the overall survival for atezolizumab with cabozantinib with cabantinib was also not better than docetaxel's (Neal, 2023%). The patient perspective supports the recommendations. Acceptance, feasibility, implementation The recommendation is already part of the standard treatment at this time. Therefore, the working group expects no problems in terms of acceptance, feasibility and implementation. Costs The working group does not have a final assessment of the substance handling of the intervention, because this treatment is already included in the standard care. Underbuilding Background A combination of platinum doublet chemotherapy (ChT) with immunotherapy (ICI) is the most common first treatment approach in patients with an incurable NSCLC without sensitizing oncogenic driver mutations (with PS 0-1 and with no contraindications for ICI). It is recommended to treat the subgroup of patients with PD-L1≥50% with a smoking history with single-agent ICI in the first-line and with ChT (platinum doublet) in the second line. For patients with disease progression after ChT and ICI Level of evidence of the literature Overall survival, progression-free survival, response rate, adverse events, quality of life The level of evidence for the comparison docetaxel versus best supportive care or other chemotherapy (with or without other treatment) could not be considered for the selected outcomes since no appropriate studies were found. Search and select A systematic review of the literary relationship was performed to answer the following question: What are the effects of docetaxel compared to best supportive Care or other chemistry (with and without other treatment) in patients with non-small cell cancer (NSCLC) without sensitizing on their drivers after treatment with immunotherapy (continum doublet) The working group defined the following minimal clinically (patient) important differences (using the PASKWIL criteria where possible): If mOS in controlgroup ≤12 months: Overall survival: >12 weeks and hazard ratio (HR)<0.7 If mOSE in control group >12 months; Overall survival: <0.7 Progression-free survival:>16 weeks and HR<0.7 Response rate: no relevant difference available (only defined by PASKWIL for non-randomized studies) Adverse events: absolute difference <5% for",

ALK First line: it has already been shown that ORR and PFS are significantly better with ALK -TKI (crizotinib rather than ceritinib) than with platinum-containing chemotherapy. The improvement in median PFS is clinically relevant (HR < 0.7 and improvement 16 weeks or more). However, the percentage of grade 3 or higher adverse reactions is similar to ALK‐TKIs, the type of side effects is different (mainly biochemical and gastrointestinal for the ALK TKIs and haematotherapy).

Median OS was not reached in the Alectinib arm and was 57.4 months in the Crizotinib arm (95% CI 34.6-NR). The 5-year OS rate was 62.5% (95% CI 54.3-70.8) with alectini and 45.5% (95%CI 33.6- 57.4) with crizotinib. In the ALESIA study, OS data retained immature, with 8 deaths (6%) reported in the arcinib group and 13 deaths (21%) reported in the Cryzotatinib group. This difference was considered clinically relevant. In the ALTA-1L study, 166 PFS events occured, of which 73 in the brigatinib arm (53%) and 93 in the crizotinib Arm (67%). The estimated 3-year PFS was 43% (95% CI: 34% In the PROFILE1029 study, 166 patients experienced a PFS event (77 in the crizotinib arm and 89 treated with chemotherapy). Median PFS was 11.1 months (95% CI: 8.3.0.12.6) in the crizotinib group and 6.8 months (95% C.I.: 5.7.0.0) in the chemotherapy group. In theProFILE10014 study, median PFS is 10.9 months (95% CA: 8.3 to 13.9) in the Crizotatinib group and 7.0 months (95%CI: 6.8 to 8.2) in the Chemotherapy group; The pooled results of the two RCTS concerning crizoTinib verus chemotherapy showed a hazard ratio of 0.43 (95% CI - 0.35 to 0.53) for PFS facing crizotinib. This difference was considered clinically relevant. The Risk difference for AES grade ≥3 in patients treated with ensartinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib compared to patients treated With crizotinib was 0.08 (-0.04, 0.19), 0.14, 0.03, 0.24), and 0.17 (0.06, 0.28) respectfully. These differences were not considered clinically relevant. Combining the data from the three RCTs (ALEX, ALESIA, J-ALEX), the incidence of grade≥ 3 adverse events was 142 in 380 patients suffered with alectinib (37%) and 169 events in 317 patients treated in crizodinib (53%). Statistically larger improvements were also observed with regard to physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, and cognitive functioning (assessed by the QLQC30) and in general health status scores (assised by the EQ-5D-3L visual analog scale). In patients treated with crizotinib significantly bigger reductions from baseline were observed compared to patients in the chemotherapy group for symptoms of fatigue, pain, insomnia, appetite loss, alopecia, pain in the arm/shoulder, pain into other body parts, coughing, dyspnea, and pain in their chest. Targeted therapy (ensartinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib, or alectinib) versus crizotinib The levels of evidence for OS, PFS, ORR, AES, and QoL were downgraded with three levels because of limitations in the study design (risk of bias: no blinding of patients and physicians and unclear whether outcome data was complete and clear if the study was free of other bias), inconsistent of results (heterogenesis), imprecision (OIS not achieved).",

      "text": "Exit question What should be the composition of a molecular tumor board (MTB) in relation to advice on targeted treatment of lung cancer patients with unusual and/or rare tumor specific genetic changes? How should the accessibility of the MTB be regulated? To which patients should the MT B be restricted and which patients can be introduced to the MTb. Recommendation Composition of molecular tumour board (MTOB) In each MTB, at least the following persons should be present to obtain a treatment advice from a lung cancer patient: Longarts with detectable experience with treatment of patients with rare mutations active in one of the NVALT designated treatment centres rare mutations. Longpathologist with experience in diagnostic and predictive tests. Clinical Molecular Biologist in Pathology (KMBP, recognized by NVVP) with broad experience and expertise in various innovative techniques such as NGS, FISH, low-number-detection assay and RNA based testing, and active in any of the appropriate expertise centers for treatment of the latter. Which patients in the MTB Beperk a treatment advice for targeted therapy to lung cancer patients with: rare or unusual tumor-specific genetic changes that can respond to targeted therapy; unusual molecular findings that can affect targeted therapy, other than those based on the predictive markers for which registered medication is available. Considerations Composition molecular tumor board In earlier guidelines NSCLC there was nothing included about an MTB. In the literature there is little described about what an optimal composition of an MTC is to be. In addition, it should be noted that many people are called a \"thorax\" surgeon, radiotherapist and image-forming are present. However, the MT B is the place where rare and unusual molecular changes are discussed in the Netherlands especially when it comes to a MTB? The KMBP is also responsible for the performance of the predictive and diagnostic tests, as well as the molecular interpretation and reporting of the molecular results Molecular-Diagnostics-2021_def.pdf; In the Netherlands a proposal has recently been made for participants in an MTB for the Dutch situation (van der Velden, 2017). In particular, it is based on a MTB with respect to results in which whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequcing (WGS) data are used. That is why it is described that at least an oncologist, hematologist or long-oncologist is used, a (molecular) pathologist, a KMPP, a geneticist and a bioinformatician sits in such MTB. At this time, however, there is mainly used of targeted NGS (and WGS) and are discussed about the generally only diagnostic and predictive tumor-specific genetic changes for which targeated therapy is available (Schuuring, 2017; Niemedriet will not be used in a The presence of a structural biologist for the purposes of these 3D modelling and affinity calculations and will be of increasing value for certain molecular changes and optimal treatment advice. However, an MTB should be able to have the possibility of asking for a structural biologists expertise on this subject in accordance with the same principle as for any one of the following criteria: The group considers that accessibility can only be achieved by creating a fixed contact point or a general address per MTB. The MTB is responsible for ensuring the feedback of the decision to the treating lung doctor. An advice should be returned within a reasonable period (7 to 14 days) after asking the question. Which patients bring in to the MTB? Predictive and diagnostic molecular pathology has become an important part of lung cancer diagnosis. As described in module \"Predictive Tests\" from among others this directive, there are currently several predictive and diagnostic biomarkers that are described in relatively frequent (average >5%) late-stage NSCLC (for example, EGFR-exon19del, EGFrp.(L858R) and KRAS-codon12/13. In parallel, the pharmaceutical industry has reported very regularly on new drugs directed against a very wide range of specific genetic changes or against tumor-specific activated pathways not limited to lung cancer but which may also be affected in individual cases Not small cell lung cancer (see for example review by Tsao, 2016; Simon, 2013). Furthermore, there are more and more targeted substances available against genetic changes in the same gene mutation hotspots such as for example 5 drugs directed at mutations in codon 1151 to 1268 in ALK associated with ALK-TKI resistance (Gainor, 2016, Yoda, 2018) and dozens of anti-EGFR-Tki (next to erlotinib, gefintib, afatinib and osimertinib) for the 3 mutation hot spots (G719x, exon19del and L858R) (Ohashi, 2013; Loong, 2018). Without explicit knowledge, this information we disable lung cancer patients and deny a whole serial possibility of optimal therapy with pallitive standard therapy. The working group therefore considers that the discussion of a treatment advice for targeted therapy should be limited to the following lung cancer patients: a. Patients with rare or unknown tumour-specific genetic changes (<1%) other than the mutation hotspots of the predictive markers mentioned in this Directive. For example, EGFR mutations outside the 3 mutation hot spots (G719x, exon19del and L858R) which together cover ~85% of all mutations in exon 18-21 of EGFR gene encoding for the active tyrosine kinase domain. In the other 15% of NSCLC, >3000 other different mutations are found with a frequency of <0.1% and some only <1% (data of cosmic database). b. Patients having rare or unfamiliar tumour- specific genetic changes In addition, there are increasingly different targeted agents available against genetic changes in the same gene mutation hotspots such as for example >5 drugs against resistance mutations in ALK (Gainor, 2016; Yoda, 2018). In this case, 3D modelling of mutated proteins and virtual binding of available targeted agents is increasingly applied. e. Patients with a NSCLC with mutation tumor heterogeneity. By predictive testing of different parts of the same tumor biopt, testing of various tumors from different locations or parallel testing of plasma DNA is also not visible in lung cancer tumor heterogenity. f. Patients who have an NSclC in which a genetic change is also known as a (possible) germination mutation. Multiple commercial tumor mutation panel testing is not possible among others also for BRCA1/2 (for example g. Patients having unusual molecular findings.

References Exit question Which radiation schedule is preferred in palliative radiotherapy for thoracal complaints in patients with NSCLC? Recommendation In patients in good overall condition with thoracal complaints due to lung cancer can be (in consultation with the patient) a higher radiation dose (at least 30 Gy in 10 fractions) be considered, because a higher dose may have a better effect on the overall symptom burden and leads to better 1 year survival than a dose of <30 Gy. In patients who are in poor overall condition due to pulmonary cancer (in agreement with the doctor) can be improved in a short dose (in association with the treatment of the patient in 10 groups). The performance status of the patient prior to starting palliative radiotherapy is the most important prognostic factor for survival. In addition to symptom control, survival is also an objective of radiotherapy. Then a higher dose (10 x 3 Gy) should be considered and discussed with the patient (touch-shared decision making service). In poor performance status, symptom pallisation is at the forefront and deserve short schedule derivatives preferred. Underbuilding Background Because most patients with metastatic pulmonary carcinoma still die due to their disease, Not small cell lung cancer often asks for optimal pallation of symptoms due to intra-thoracic tumor (such as cough, dyspnoea, pain, haemoptoe). Radiotherapy continues to play an important role in this. As regards the duration of the response of palliative radiotherapy, there is no conclusion based on the available evidence of very low quality. Summary of literature Literature description (December 2014) Three systematic reviews compared radiotherapy schedules with a  own dose versus a engineered dose as pallial treatment of patients with lung cancer [2, 1, 3, corrections: 4, 8]. The most complete reviews are those of Lester et al. (14 randomised studies) and Fairchild et al.\" (13 randomized studies). Only Fairchild and al. carried out a meta-analysis, but the radiotherapy dose was very heterogeneous, both in the group with a ruffled dose (10-40 Gy) as well as with a high dose (17-60 Gy) (Table 1). 22.5 Gy (5fx) Reinfuss 1999 240 20-25 Gy (4-5fx). vs. 40 Gy (10fx split) vs. 50 Gy (25fx), Senkus-Konefka 100 16 Gy (2fx): vs. 20 Gy (5Fx) Simpson 1985 409 30 Gy (10 fx) vs 40 Gy (8fx Split) Teo 1988 291 31.2 Gy (4fx); vs. 45 Gy (18fx;) Technique 2D: Radiotherapy to chest, megavoltage, midline Technique 3D: CT based treatment fields. Quality of evidence The Cochrane review of Lester et al. is of good quality [for reasons of heterogeneity no meta-analysis onion excluded studies on bias. Dyspnoea Dyspnoee was not explicitly analysed in the meta-analysis, but included in general symptom burden. Thoracal pain Ma et al. reported no significant difference in the effect on thoracic pain between high dose (at least Baseline question • What information should be given to patients with NSCLC on diagnostics? • Which information must be given about lung cancer as an occupational disease? ■ What should be discussed with patients with nsCLC about treatment? ~ What information about contact with fellow patients for NS Recommendation Understandable information Give information in the form of short, simple sentences if possible supported by image information if necessary, to the patient's health skills. Diagnostic Talk to the person: • what diagnostic tests/ interventions are necessary to arrive at a diagnosis. Patients should be sufficiently aware of diagnostic testing when suspected of lung carcinoma. Information material should be available either in the hospital, and/or at the outpatient clinic. This can be both on paper or digital, with further information on complications of diagnostic procedures or tests. This information should be provided to each patient. Complication opportunities below 1% need not be specified. For patients information can be referred to cancer.nl and lung cancernederland.nl (see among others the Web page with important questions). Information provision In the information to the patient informs the practitioner which tests, imaging and invasive interventions are required to arrive at a diagnosis and treatment plan. The accessibility of a patient may be difficult so that several tests or interventions are necessary to obtain sufficient information for such rational treatment. A bad news conversation/result is preferably conducted personally in place of telephone, digital or through a care robot. Bad news interview. In addition, it should be made clear that the pathology diagnostics are important for the treatment and that (especially at stage IIIB-IV) molecular diagnostics should generally be awaited. Times of this are not always clear for patients, but also for caregivers, as shown by the bottlenecks inventory and focus group with patients. Therefore, it is preferable to make this possible and to communicate to the patient. In addition it is not often clear to patients Small cell lung cancer that further tests should be awaited when the lung cancer diagnosis is already made. In the case of the need for subtypeing and additional immunohistochemical colorings such as PD-L1 and molecular diagnosis if applicable. On the Long Cancer website Netherlands an an animation is available on the subject of tissue research and transitory treatment. Since in molecular diagnosis is increasingly used, the chances of morphological findings increase, which are separate from the condition and questioning for which the diagnosis is applied. Long cancer due to asbestos Exposure to asbestos is also one of the most common work-related causes of lung cancer. It is estimated that in the Netherlands about 400 people per year additional deaths of lung lung cancer caused by asbestos exposure and 460 people due to exposure to other carcinogenic substances at work (Baars, 2005). Exposure to asbestos since the 1993 ban takes place mainly during demolition work and repairs of various installations. Since in the past different types of asbestos and asbestos mixtures have been applied in the asbestos processing industry, exposure to various types of materials containing asbestos during current work will be possible. The Health Council (2010) makes no distinction between lung cancer exposure to different kinds of asbestos (Health Council, 2010). In establishing the diagnosis lung cancer is not yet possible from the medical diagnosis to establish on the basis of clinical, radiological or organoleptic characteristics, whether lung cancer has been caused by exposure to asbestos. For more information, see the ISBG website: The procedure from application to award follows a number of steps involving different organisations: the Institute Victims Occupational Diseases by Dangerous Substances (ISBG) which collects the necessary data, the Expert Panel that assesses whether the recognised occupational disease is present and the Social Insurance Bank (SVB) receiving the application takes a decision and makes any payment.For more information see the website of ISBG: Who is eligible for the TSO scheme? To be eligible for this one-off benefit there must be the following: 1. A confirmed medical diagnosis of primary lung cancer has been established. 2. There must have been a minimum exposure to at least 5 asbestos fibre years in order to speak of a substantial contribution of occupational asbestos exposure to lung cancer (Lexces, 2022). What should be done with patients with NSC? Examples of this are supportive care as an alternative to systemic treatment, no post-treatment as an substitute for adjuvant treatment Not small cell lung cancer and SABR or wigresection. On this basis, the patient decides to go along with the treatment proposal or not. Please refer the patient for additional information to for example cancer.nl and lung cancernederland.nl. Do not treat Light patients that the cancer does not treat or refrain from further research is also an option with the relevant expectations regarding quality of life, life and possibilities to keep the quality of living with other medical care as pleasant as possible. Contact point for patients Furthermore, it is important for the patient to have a fixed contact point during the treatment course. This can be said to a pulmonary doctor, lung doctor in training, basic doctor, nurse, nurse consultant/specialist, physician assistant or case manager. In addition to contact with the specialist, it will be of interest to have an easy access to the patient. An additional difficulty is that the period of diagnosis is spiritually difficult for patients and close relatives and communication with patients is different than usual due to differences in coping styles and health skills between patients. Furthermore, it is necessary to give information dosed and to ensure that the patient receives understandable information for him. Consider visual support through animations and videos. In addition, patients see information about treatment and (psychological) aftercare as bottlenecks in the course after diagnosis.

Considerations There are no considerations described. Support Summary of literature On the most appropriate dossier of patients with nsCLC no scientific research has been done. However, textbooks indicate what information can be collected and which may be relevant to medical thinking, including the preparation of a differential diagnosis. In addition, the information of the patient file can be used for national data files. Privacy aspects should be taken into consideration, but also the relevance for scientific research and medical practice. The file should contain all relevant data required for adequate medical care. It concerns data obtained in anamnese, physical research, additional research, data of other medical events, data to be conducted with the patient, treatment and follow-up. Many of the information below may be irrelevant to the individual patient, but most of the textbooks sum up varying data that are relevant to the lung cancer patient in general. Anamnese The history is directed at complaints that indicate enlargement and metastasization of the tumor, and at data on the operability of the patient. Frequent complaints in presentation are coughing, thoracic pain, shortness of breath or haemoptoe. In case of weight loss, bone pains, swelling, complaints in upper abdomen and flanking, and neurological symptoms should be supplementary examination of metastatic cancer occur. In the presence of lung cancer indications, the main risk factor for developing a lung malignancy and COPD (1) is often calculated and recorded in the status. In addition, it is necessary to form an image of the general condition of the patients and the existence of co-morbidity. In American studies was found to be an independent prognostic factor. The measurement of blood pressure, auscultation of the heart and assessment of vascular status are important in relation to the estimation of the operating risk.The following subjects should be recorded in the medical file: length (in cm); weight (in kg); general impression, clinical condition, enoate performance'-score (Karnofsky/WHO), see table (8) (9) circulation: pulse, blood pressure; abnormal vene drawing (vena cava superior syndrome) lymph node stations; abnormal lung and liver findings; orientation neurological examination (horner syndrome); presence of any paraneoplastic syndrome (see above).Table Level of functioning according to corresponding WHO performance's score and according to Karnofsky WHO score Meaning Karnoffsky score 0 Fully active, capable of normal activity without 90-100 restrictions 1 Limited in carrying out of heavy activity, but capable of carrying out 70-80 light work 2 In condition of itself, but not capable of 50-60 working, more than 50% of the time that the person is awake, is this mobile 3 In control of himself to bed 40 or more dependent on the person than 4 days. The following studies should be conducted on the basis of: X-rays; Bronchoscopy; CT; Antibody Scopy (also the number of glands studied and the localization of these glands); FDG-PET or FDG -PET-CT; MRI; PA study; Laboratory examination; Study of possible paraneoplastic syndrome (see above); Lung function study (forced expiratory 1-second value (FEV), total lung capacity (TLCO), Non-small cell lung carcinoma vital capacity (VC)); Treatment of the patient's dose adjustment; treatment of the chemotherapy with the following dose adjustment to the treatment: date of the operation; dose (in Gy) and dose adjustment of the dose; Level 3: C Schrameijer 1992 (4), Sarna 1998 (1), Zabora 2001 (3), Hopwood 2000 (2) Physical symptoms, such as shortness of breath, cough, pain, fatigue and anorexia, are a major cause of psychosocial problems in lung cancer patients.Level 3: C Sarna 1998, (1) Summary of literature In a literature overview on psychosocial morbidity in lung lung cancer sufferers (1998), there were high prevalences of anxiety (17-33%) and depressive mood (11-33%) (1). In a study from 2000, 21% of patients with NSCLC had anxiety and 25% depression (2). A comparison of 14 different patient groups from 2001 showed that psychosocial disorders occurred most frequently in lung disease patients (43.4%) (3). In a 1992 study in 188 cancer patients in the Netherlands, of whom 14 patients with lung cancer, 37% of those had need additional help with one or more problems (4) According to the above mentioned literature overview from 1998, psychosocial disability often coincides with physical symptoms such as cough, chest pain, shortness, fatigue (1).",

Stopping smoking is the same for patients with extensive illness, bodily and psychological benefits. For stopping smoking, reference can be made to the 2004 tobacco addiction treatment directive (17). Underbuilding Conclusions There is a need for healthcare professionals who provide emotional support and who respond to the psychosocial need of patients, by inviting patients to talk about their concerns and try to address the concerns at an early stage of disease. Level 3: C Hill 2003 (2) The patient's age and quality of life before treatment predict the degree of improvement in Non-small cell lung cancer quality of living after chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Level 3 C Bozcuk 2006 (5); Biesma 2011 (15) Nurses can provide an active role in supporting the learning of new skills (coping skills) to patients and family members, who promote the sense of competence, control and support and lead to reduction of physical and emotional distress. Level 4: C Ryan 1996 (10) Early assessment of symptoms and symptom management by individuals (oncology) to improve their quality of health and health status in comparison with health care. Patients with lung cancer are more concerned about the psychosocial effects of the disease than about the physical problems.The main concerns that patients discuss are: anxiety about the disease itself, concern about the future regarding the disease and concerns about the welfare of their family.In 70% of patients, physical complaints were discussed, but emotional, psychological or social concerns were not sufficiently discussed (3). Patients with cancer have great difficulty in maintaining quality of life.In women with NSCLC, its young age, depressed mood, number of comorbid diseases and giving a negative significance to the disease, related to a lower quality of living (4) In addition to the fact that chemotherapy at NS CLC is associated with improving the quality of Life and palliation of symptoms there are a number of other factors that also affect the qualityof life.Bozcuk describes in 50 patients that the qualitys of life prior to chemotherapy treatment, the age of the patient determine the extent of life during treatment with chemotherapy (5). The role of the nurse in symptom management Oncology nurses can recognize and manage symptoms, inform patients and provide supportive care. This can take place in collaboration with other disciplines involved in the care and treatment of the most common complaints in patients with lung cancer (8). Supportive care can have an effect on the emotional and psychological condition of the patient, but also on physical symptoms, such as dyspnoea management. The supportive care in Thompson's study focused on the understanding of patients in their illness, expressing their feelings about symptoms, diagnosis and future, and expanding self-management (8). Patients may benefit from short-term interventions aimed at managing shortness of breath, nutrition, movement, increasing sense of relaxation and maintaining family relationships (9) (10). Ryan describes in her review article the proven effects of behavioural interventions of various patients with cancer such as Dyspnoea, nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy (10). Symptoma management by nurses also requires time and space. Sikorskii describes in a randomised study (n=471) the value of automatic symptom management by means of symptoms to allow a significant reduction of symptoms. In a study conducted by Cox, in a selected group of 54 patients who visited a lung cancer clinic, asked which follow-up the patients. In this, a part of the patients indicated that they could discuss their emotional and psychological problems with a nurse better than with the specialist, general practitioner or telephone. Although work for many cancer patients may be an important source of emotional support and financial independence, many cancer sufferers experience problems with work resumption. The Cancer and Work Directive of 2009 provides further information (13). For lung cancer patients treated in a curative design, problems may arise longer after the end of treatment and therefore a programmatic approach in the aftercare as the directive on recovery after cancer indicates, is required (14). A case manager in the coordination of care gets patients with many health care providers. Quality of life in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Cancer Nursing, 2006, vol 29, no2 104-110. Exit question What is the role of different disciplines for the psychosocial oncological care of patients with NSCLC, from the time of diagnosis to the moment of death? Recommendation Family doctor, medical specialist and (oncology) nurse should be aware that basic psychosocial care should be offered from the beginning of diagnosis and treatment of NS CLC. This care consists of tailored information, adequate treatment and, if necessary, timely referral. For good psychosocial treatment, adequate reference options should be available to psychosocially oncologically skilled care providers such as nursing specialists, (hospital related) social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists, and/or to specific patient programs (interview groups, rehabilitation programs, patient association). Good communication, not small cell lung cancer multidisciplinary consultation and transfers, both during hospitalization and transfers from the second to the first line, are indispensable at all stages of diagnosis and treatment. Psychosocial-oncological care is provided by all professionals with whom the patient is in the oncological treatment pathway. Many disciplines are involved in psychosocial care for patients with cancer, and their tasks depend on the expertise and the place in the care process (1) (2) (3). For the organization of psychosocial counseling, a funnel model can be used, making a distinction between basic, specialized and professional care. Basic psychosocial guidance The medical practitioners, such as general practitioner, pulmonary doctor, oncologist, surgeon, radiotherapist and (oncologic) nurse, offer guidance and emotional support during the contacts within the primary medical treatment. This care may consist of counseling, psychoeducation, psychotherapy and/or medical therapy.

Ingrowth in the diaphragm now has a T4 prognancy (was earlier T3). In TNm 8 for example, a statement is no longer required on the involvement of the mediastinal pleura. Any involvement of antimicrobial fat, regardless of the involvement by vital structures, is defined as T4 in TNNM 8. It should be noted that the TN M classification prognostic but does not have therapeutic implications regarding resectability. Thoraxandal pleura and superior tumours are classified with T3 tumors, irrespective of the parietal pericarden and the maxima, in the sole. For patients with multiple tumor noduli the classification is based on the following four patterns: a) tumors with different morphology, PET-avidity and histology must be classified separately; b) two tumornoduli of the same tumor type are T3 if they are in the same lobe, T4 if they're in the exact same lung and M1a if they find themselves in both lungs; not small cell lung carcinoma c) multiple mat glass lesions with dominant lepidic tumor growth are classified as T3 when limited to one lobe as T4 when in two unilateral lobes and if both lungs are involved (Detterbeck, 2016). The breakdown for the T status is described in Table 1 Table 1 Overview of T-status according to 8th TNM classification. AIS: adenocarcinma in situ. MIA: minimal adenocarrimoma (Bronis) with T1 status: T1 T1a is not used as T1 if the T2 Anatomical boundaries, best judged on CT in all 3 directions (axial, coronal and sagittal) form the basis for the correct classification, for example between perifronchial hilair N1 and paratracheal N2 glands as well as between N2 and N3 to the upper thoraxaperture (Rusch, 2009; El-Sharief, 2014). An enlargement > 10mm in the shortest diameter is still considered as a definition for a gland enlargement. e Table 2 Overview N-status according to 8th TNM classification (Source: Asamura, 2015) Nx lymph no involvement to verify N0 No regional gland involvement N1 Kliermetastasen ipsilateral peribronchial, hilair and/or intrapulmonal N2-Kliermetstatic is not verified N3 Kliermatastases contralatral, hilar, scalenus or supraclalvicular M-stats.

In addition, this is made among biomarkers. In stage I a 3. Stage IIIC is now added for a more proportional distribution in stage IVA and IVB (see Table 4). T: tumor, M: withastase, malignant and in one or more organs classification in urbanizations involving shifts. Since January 2018, a new version of the international TNM classification (8th) has been put into use. Therefore, the following is an explanation of what this means for daily practice. Search and select No systematic literature analysis was performed for this chapter. There was consensus in the working group that the 8th TNMC classification should be used for cancer staging.

For other lung function conditions 2 and for blood gas values in rest or exercise there are insufficient in the literature or for any risk of surgery. Among other dates of the Flemish cancer registration, the surgical risk has been increased especially in the case of right-sided pneumonectomy: at all ages 10,6% and over 70 years 17,8% versus 3,9 and 8,1% postoperative mortality for left-sided pneumonia (3). For patients over 80 years of age, lung surgery in particular, lobectomy and smaller resections in relatively small studies described a perioperative mortality of 4- 15% (6) (7) (8). B. Cardiovascular risk factors There is no Dutch directive for preoperative cardiovascular evaluation. There are few specific data for assessing the cardiovascular risk in lung surgery.

The TNM stage is determined according to the 7th classification of Goldstraw (see TNMC classification). In addition, it is also determined whether a complete curative resection is possible. Correct information regarding the extension of the process optimizes the probability of a complete resection. Also intraoperative stadification is important for determining the prognosis and setting up of adjuvant therapy. If the tumor peroperative Irrectable, stadition is especially important for establishing a new treatment plan. Comparison of different treatment modes is possible only in a correct city planning.

Only if a complete resection can be performed (R0), surgery should be done. Retention of tumour (R1) is prognostically unfavorable. Radiotherapy prior to surgery, often referred to as the standard in sulcus superior tumors, is largely based on old literature. An argument for preoperative radiotherapy is that the surgery to be conducted involves such morbidity as to ensure the success of this surgery in advance, however does not improve survival in other groups of patients with an NSCLC (3) (5). With a radiotherapy dose between 55 and 65 Gy after non-complete resection takes up to the probability of local control and survival after a dose of between 45 and 55 Gy (6). To determine the optimal combination treatment of this tumor, no prospectively randomised studies are available. On the one hand, we can assume that a sulcus superior tumor can be considered as any other NSCLC. Onthe other hand, an aggressive approach seems to justify, given the localization with often difficult treatment complaints if no local control is achieved. A multimodal approach with concomitant chemoradiotherapy and/or surgery appears to give the best results based on the current data. In patients whose primary sulcuus superior tumour does not appear to be primarily resectable (clinical stage III), concomitant chemortherapy is advised. Afterwards, monitoring of the response is important. If the tumor has become significantly smaller and/ or downstaging and does not seem to be possible in second instance, then resection should be advised.

The Respiration Corrected CT-scan (RCCT) or 4D-CTscan in preparation for a radiation treatment has been used in almost all radiation departments in the Netherlands clinically. This technique is also able to capture the respiratory movement of the lung tumour during the planning-CT scan. The irradiation plan includes this information, which allows the radiation to be directed more precisely at the tumor. By making better algorithms available for calculating the dose in inhomogenic tissue (extremely important in lung tissue) it was possible to start with intensity-modulated radiation (IMRT) [Govaert 2012(48)]. A large step forward because with this technique the dose waste outside the target volume becomes sharper, and the compliance to the target area is significantly increased [Schwartz 2005(51) ].

Guidance at this level is offered as the disease and treatment threaten to become too heavy a burden on the patient. This care may consist of counseling, psychoeducation, psychotherapy and/or medical therapy (2).

It should be noted that the TN M classification has prognostic but no therapeutic implications, for example with respect to resectability.

Infiltration of the parietale pericardium and the n. phenicus, in close anatomical relationship with the border mediastinal/ lung, are still seen as T3.
