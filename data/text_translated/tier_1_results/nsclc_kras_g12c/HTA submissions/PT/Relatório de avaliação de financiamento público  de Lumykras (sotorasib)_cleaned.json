      "text": "Lung cancer is an oncological disease but diagnosed worldwide (excluding non-melanocytic cutaneous neoplasms) and is the leading cause of death from cancer worldwide. Globally, only 18% of patients will be alive 5 years or more after the diagnosis of the disease. The majority of patients are diagnosed in an advanced stage (not curable), because the incidence and mortality numbers are very similar. Lung cancer was diagnosed above all after the age of 65 years, a median age of diagnosis in the next 70 years. A WHO estimate that in 2020 5284 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed in Portugal, representing a third but frequent neoplasia in no country (fourth among women). A prevalence estimated of the disease in a period of 5 years is 5 304 cases. The data from the National Oncological Registry of Reference 4 424 new patients with tracheal and bronchial cancer in 2018. The CPNPC KRAS mutadoes constitute a molecularly diversified and clinically heterogeneous group. Among all the mutations KRAS, a variation mono-nucleotide KRAS p.G12C, with glycine substituida por cisteína no codão 12, is a more frequent variant, with a prevalence of approximately 7 to 12% in CPNCP, 13% in adenocarcinomas.",

      "text": "LUMYCRAS (sotorasib) is a covalent and irreversible inhibitor of the KRAS G12C cysteine. An inactivation of KRASG12C by the sotorasib blocks a signalisation, inhibits growth and promotes selective apoptosis in tumors carrying KRASg12C, with minimal detectable activity outside this target. These mutations initiate the oncogenous process and activate the signaling pathways that a tumor needs to survive. To block this signaling may induce apoptosis and a tumor regression. This is a framework for the use of two inhibitors of tyrosinacinase without advanced CPNPC, with KRAS G12C mutado, therapeutic treatments now with the possibility of sequential use of quimioterapy or immunotherapy. Posology: 75 mg/m2 IV, 21/21 days; until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. O nintedanib is a triple inhibitor of angiocinase that blocks the activity of the receptors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR 1-3), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (GFR α e ß) and fibroblast growth factor 12 (FGFR 1-3). Posology: 500 mg/m2 IV, 21/21 days, up to progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. Nivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) (HuMAb), which binds to the programmed death receptors-1 (PD-1) and blocks interactions with PD-L1 and ap-L2. Since the CPNPC corresponds to about 85,0% of the cases of lung cancer in Portugal, it is possible to conclude that there are about 4,603 new cases of CPNCC diagnosed annually in Portugal. However, only recently, it was possible to evaluate robustly a prevalence of the mutation p.G12C in patients with CPNVAM. For example, there is a need to recourse to data from the AACR GENIE registry, an international registry with information on 19 main cases of cancer treatment in the world. It is possible to conclude that, of the 4,603 cases of CPNPC diagnosed annually, 557 (12,1%) will be KRAS p.G12C positive.",

All the studies were considered relevant for a present evaluation, notably the studies CodeBreak 100 and 200 for data prior to its development, the study oraseb enters the data of Lumykras (Sasib) safety and data of comparison indirect and the test CodeBbreak 200 for analysis of effectiveness compared. No treatment of patients with advanced CPNPC KRAS p.G12C positive previously treated with at least one systemic therapeutic agent. The criteria for inclusion were adult patients (aged equal to or above 18 years) with diagnosis of CPNCP KRAS P.G 12C positive, in advanced or metastatic stage (III-IV); ECOG PS de 0 or 1; progresão da doença após um tratamento prévio com: agents anti-PD-1 or PD-L1, em monotherapy or em combinação com quimioterapia à base de platina, or quimiotherapy à base d' platina. The main criteria for exclusion were: number of lines of treatment superior to three, a presence de metastasis cerebrais. A segurança, foi avaliada com taxa de Efeitos Adversos (EA) based on version 5 of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The study included an exploratorial analysis of QoL, through the questionnaires of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), Quality of life Questionnaires on Lung Cancer 13 (EorTC QlQ LC13) and the assessment of all analytical responses (EQD-5) of the study. A committee of occultation (blinded) and independent evaluators monitored the study for effectiveness. It was planned to include 105 patients in the second phase of the CodeBreaK 100 study, in order to obtain a 90% chance of detecting an objective response (primary indicator) greater than 23%, with a level of significance of 5%. This pre-specified value of 23% was withdrawn from the objective response observed without an arm of treatment with ramucirumab, in combination with cometaxel, no Phase III REVEL study. A response was drawn up in frequency and percentages, the confidence intervals were 95% calculated by the Clopper-Pearson method. The intervals for the SG and SLP objectives were summarized using the Kaplan-Meier estimates and confidence interval of 95%. The diagram describing the flow of patients without a study CodeBreak 100 is presented in Figure 1. The results of the studies included a survival (including a global survivência (OS), a surviência sem progressão (PFS) and a sobrevivência sem eventos (EFS), a tempo de progresão (TTP), o tempo para o próximo tratamento (TTNT), as rates de resposta, a taxa de controle da doença, a duração do tratamento e os eventos adversos. The studies were identified through the research of electronic databases, lists of references of relevant articles, processes of conferences and other supplementary sources. for Systematic Revisões e Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) e das Normas e Declarações Consolidadas de Ensaios (CONSORT). The flow of publications included and excluded from the systematic review is presented in Figure 2. Product: AMG 510 SLR Protocol Number: 20200340 Figure Date: 16 2.

However, none of the studies satisfied the requirements for the realization of an indirect comparison through a non-anchored MAIC, the two comparators considered in the initial evaluation proposal (docetaxel + nitendanib; pemetrexedo; nivolumab; pembroumab); athezolizumab: duplicates de platina) face a submassive (CodeBreaK 100). The main reasons identified were the absence of additional comparators of interest (76,5%, n=13); absences of information crucial for the realization of the MAIC na população de interesse (KRAS G12C), or an increased population of KRAS mutado (23,5%, n =4) Thus, the only viable indirect comparison in patients with CPNPC advanced KRAS or KRAS G 12C mutado, previously treated, was a de suborasib versus docetaxel, based on the results of the study CodeBreak 100 (sotarasib) and SELECT-1 (docetaxel). In view of the current data, it is not expected that this population difference represents a prognostic factor or modifier of effect relevant to docetaxel. The two studies allow for the inclusion of patients with pre-treatment. However, no SELECT-1 study was limited to just one pre- Treatment, as opposed to the CodeBreaK 100 study, which allowed up to three lines of pre-Treatment. On the other hand, no study SELECT-1, this indicator was only evaluated by the researchers. An indirect comparison was carried out through the methodology MAIC not anchored, taking as covariates considered relevant was identified after revision of the literature and discussion with medical experts in the area. However, out of a total of 21 potentially covariables, only four were selected, according to its availability in studies and the level of prognostic importance in patients treated with subcutaneous or docetaxel. In relation to global survival, it was estimated that there was no risk of death of 39% (HR=0,611; IC 95%: 0,451; 0,829), which translates into an extension of the median survival time of 7,2 months (15,3 versus 8,1 months) (Figure 3). Figure 3. No risk of progression or death and an extension of 3,5 months no median tempo until event (6.3 versus 2.8 months) (Figure 4) Figure 4. Kaplan-Meier curves (adjustments) of treatments under assessment and docetaxel no indicator PFS evaluated by the researcher As sensitivity analyses present values of HR slightly but advantageous for the under assessment but a reduction of ESS superior (58% no model 1 and 65% no model 2), affecting the accuracy of the estimates obtained. On the other hand, 30% of patients suffered from an EA that led to their hospitalization. Regarding the rate of abandonment of therapy for toxicity, no study CodeBreaK 100, as discontinuations of therapy due to emerging EA treatment occurred in 11 (8,7%) patients, however, only 9 (7,1%) patients of these discontinences were associated with an EA related to treatment. No study SELECT-1, occurred a total of 37 discontinotions no braço de tratamiento con docetaxel, corresponding to 15% of the population treated. The report presented by the TAIM describes the results of the study after a primary analysis of the primary objective of effectiveness of PFS, when approximately 230 PFS events occurred, while the study continued as planned. The study was planned for study centers around the world, including approximately 330 patients. As previous therapeutic lines have been evaluated using the criteria: a chemoradiation for a locally advanced disease and irrespectable is considered a line of therapy for an advanced disease if a progression occurs within 6 months after the end of the treatment. A chemorradiation followed by a systemic treatment plan (including a checkpoint inhibitor) or vice versa intervenient documented is considered to occur within a period of 6 months following the final treatment. The adjustments to the chemotherapy regimen for intolerance are not considered a new line of therapy. Tumor evaluations were carried out during the study every 6 weeks from the 1st day until the 49th week and, subsequently, at intervals of 9 weeks until the central confirmation of the progression, the beginning of another anticancer therapeutic regimen, the withdrawal of consent, the loss of follow-up or death, which occurred first. Knowledge of the attributions of randomization, according to RECIST v1.1, are used for a primary analysis of the parameters. The eligible participants had at least 18 years of age and CPNPC was locally advanced and irrespectable or metastatic with mutation KRAS p.G12C documented histologically and no other known oncogenic mutation for which there is a therapeutic-targeted approved. An interim analysis of the PFS for superiority should be conducted when approximately 70 (160 events) of the total PFS events had been observed by both groups, or when an inclusion of patients was concluded and the last randomized individual had an opportunity to follow up for 6 weeks, or to occur later. The report of available study includes results from a date on which the first individual was randomized (June 04, 2020) until the data de corte of the two data for this PFS analysis (August 02, 2022). For this reason, the report submitted does not include a final analysis, which will be carried out when the last participant has concluded a long-term follow-up. A total of 616 participants were selected for inclusion in this study and, of these, 345 were included in the randomized controlled trials (171 individuals) or docetaxel (174 individuals). A total of 290 patients (84,1%) discontinued the experimental product (147 [86,0%] sotorasib, 143 [82,2 %] docetaxel), being the main reasons in both groups de tratamiento a progresão da doença (103 [60,2 %], 95 [54,6%] docenaxel) and adverse effects (29 [17,0 %] sotoracib, 25 [14,4%] docentaxel). A total of 247 patients (71,6%) interrupted the study (121 [70,8%] sotorasib, 126 [72,4%] docetaxel) for the following reasons: mortality (104 [60,8%], 85 [48,9%], docetaxil), withdrawal of consent (12 [7,0%], 39 [22,4%]) and loss of follow-up (5 [2,9%], 2 [1,1%]. In the data de corte dos dados for this report, 25 doentes cruzados (54,3%) continued no study, and 21 doentes cruzadas (45,7%) interrupted or studied for the following reasons: morte (17 doentes [37,0%]) and retirada do consentimento (4 doentes [8,7%]). A tax of SG estimated by Kaplan-Meier at 12 months was 45,96% for no suborasib group and 46,49% for no docetaxel group. A median of follow-up time (IC 95) for SG was 17,71 months (16,95; 19,15) for no group and 16,33 month (16,07; 17,08) for no groups. Survival book of progress A total of 223 events of PFS had been reported at data de corte of the report, including 122 participants no group (71,3%) and 101 no pacetaxel (58,0%). As the PFS rates estimated by Kaplan-Meier were of 46,49% and 39,06% at 6 months and 24,84% and 10,12% at 12 months, respectively, for suborasib versus docetaxel. A median of the follow-up time (95% CI) was of 15,24 (14,85; 17,31) months or less and 6,87 (5,42; 12,52) months or more.

In addition, data from the interim analysis of a randomized trial phase 3 in progress, randomised, open, actively controlled to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of sotorasib versus docetaxel in patients with CPNPC locally advanced and untraceable or metastatically previously treated, with mutation of KRAS p.G12C confirmed centrally. In terms of comparative effectiveness, the indirect comparative data based on the MAIC methodology provided allow us to suggest that, below, it is associated with a reduction of no risk of death by 39% (HR=0.611; IC 95% 0.451-0.829) and an extension of no median time of survival by 7.2 months; e a decrease of 56% without risk of monthly death (HR 0.442, IC95% 0.342-0.571), a decreasement of 3.5 months without average time until the event. This result was consistent with an analysis of subgroups. • In the evaluation of progress at 12 months, 24.8% of participants in no subgroup survived without progress compared to 10.1% in no group with docetaxel. • A tax de réponse objective fut meilleure no group under docetaxe (28.1% [95% CI: 21.5,4], value-p=0.002).

In terms of comparative effectiveness, the data from the interim analysis of the clinical trial of phase III indicate that the treatment with this drug resulted in an improvement in survival book of progress of 1.1 months and a 34% reduction in the probability of progression or death compared with docetaxel (HR 0.66 [95% CI: 0.51, 0.86], value-p=0.002), as well as improvement of the evaluation of progress 12 months (24.8% vs 10.1%) and objective rate of response (28. [95% ICCI: 21.5, 35.4] vs 13.2% [95% ACCI: 8.6, 19.42]. A global survival was not different between the groups. Considering globally the safety data, the study showed an acceptable profile. Conclusions It was evaluated or additional benefit of Lumykras (sotorasib) in the indication of treatment of adults with lung cancer of non-small cells (CPNPC) advanced with KRAS G12C mutado and that they have progressed after, at least, a line of systemic therapy prior to the conclusion that no additional benefit was demonstrated in relation to a standard therapeutic treatment of cometaxel, because the same was not financed indication. This study is based on the following facts: • The following data from the interim analysis of the clinical trial of phase III of 200KHR does not show a difference in the treatment of groups, taking into consideration the progress of the study compared to a comparison of 0.861.00 months of studies of the improvement of the quality of life of a patient (94.8%, 9.8% vs. 0.06% of the overall survival rate). • There are no data that allow comparison of a safety profile similar to that of a docetaxel. • There is no data which allows comparison between a doctor's profile and any of the other alternatives indicated in the evaluation matrix of their therapeutic enhancements linked to the additional benefit of Lumykras (Sotorasib) in the indication of treatment of adults with non-small cell pulmonary disease (CPNPC) developed with KRAS G12C following evaluation, less than a clinical evaluation.",
