      "text": "The assessment concerns the refund of sotorasib in the treatment of II and subsequent lines of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NDRP) with the presence of p.G12C mutation in the KRAS gene (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) after failure of at least one previous line of treatment in the existing B.6 drug program. In comparison with Pemetrexed (PMX), docetaxel and Pemeplexed monotherapy were shown to have comparable efficacy. Based on clinical analysis results, the use of sotorasib in patients with NDRP and KRAS mutation may be more effective compared to DOC in terms of progression-free survival (PFS), overall response to treatment (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) or quality of life assessment. However, no statistically significant differences in overall survival therapy (OS) have been demonstrated. Clinical analysis does not provide evidence for direct comparison of assessed technology with most comparators, i.e. nintedanib in combination with docetaxel (NIN+DOC), platinum-based dual drug chemotherapy (P-CTH), petrochemical (PMx) currently refunded therapeutic options in this indication. In addition, results for sotorazib are derived from unfinished studies of CodeBreaK 200 and CodeBreak 100. The CodeBreaK 200 study allowed cross-over from docetaxel to sotorasib. No comparison was made with other comparators, i.e. athezolizumab and nivolumab, which according to the provisions of the B.6 drug program can be used in subsequent lines of treatment for patients not previously treated with immunotherapy. This procedure reduces the reliability of the application of the clinical performance of the evaluated technology against all comparators available. According to the economic analysis, the Incremental Cost Use Index (ICUR) from the perspective of the NFZ has a profitability threshold The proposed drug is also taken into account that according to estimates of the budgetary impact assessment, the refund of Lumykras will result in the public payer's expenditure, in the variant of around 1 year and about 2 year of refund. The uncertainty of these results is related to the assumed size of the patient population and future shares of SOT in the given drug market. It should be noted that the number of patients with non-small lung cancer treated in the B.6. Assessments by other HTA agencies indicate uncertainty in terms of efficacy and cost-effectiveness estimates, therefore it is necessary to provide the final results of the studies. The guidelines indicate the possibility of using sotorasib in the second line of treatment for patients with NDRP with KRAS G12C mutation (PTOK 2022, ESMO 2023, NCCN 2023 v2). Taking into account the opinion of the Transparency Council and the potential health benefit, the President of the Agency suggests a possible refund of Lumykras (sotorasib) in the existing lung cancer medicine programme in the new limit group and giving it free of charge provided",

      "text": "Lung cancer (ICD-10 code C34) is defined as a group of cancers located in bronchi (respiratory tract) and pulmonary pulp. Typical symptoms include reduced respiratory function or shortness of breath, chest pain, haemoptysis or frequent pneumonia. Primary lung cancer is a cancer derived from epithelial cells. The most common are 4 types of histology: • gland cancer (45% - increase in incidence in the last period); • squamous cell carcinoma (30%), • small cell carcinoma (15%). • large cell carcinoma (10%). Small cell lung cancer (DRP) differs from other histological types in terms of biological and clinical characteristics (high proliferation rate, short doubling time of tumour mass, unique tendency to early metastasis formation, chemotherapy and relative radiosensitivity). The NDRP differs from other histological types in the fact that it develops slower and is characterized by limited chemosensitivity. EGFR mutations, ALK gene re-arrangements and mutations in the ROS1 gene are considered to be molecular changes of clinical significance. Lung cancer is the most common cancer in Poland and the first cause of cancer. It is approximately 20% and 10% of all cancers (in recent years - around 15,000 and 7000 diseases per year) and causes about 30% and 17%, respectively, in men and women, of all deaths caused by cancer (in 2018 - about 16,000 and 8,000 deaths respectively). In 2020, with 74.5 thousand patients with lung cancer, 26,000 deaths were reported. Overall, 5-year survival reaches ~10% of patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (operatived and non-operative combined). The rate of 5-year experience after complete resection of non-microcellular cancer in grades I, II and IIIA is equal to 60/80% in patients (operative and unoperatived).",

      "text": "Sotorasib is a selective inhibitor of KRAS G12C (an oncogenist of rat sarcoma Kirsten) which covalently and irreversibly binds to specific cysteine KRAs G12 C. Inactivation of KRAS G12c by sotorasib blocks the signaling and survival of cancer cells, inhibits cell growth and induces selective apoptosis in tumours containing KRAZ G12B mutation, an oncogenesis stimulating factor. According to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) Lumykras monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NDRP) with the KrAS G 12C mutation that have experienced disease progression following at least one previous line of application. The indication suggested is included in the registration indication. The assessment of efficacy (clinical and practical) and safety is based on the collection of data on health consequences (effectiveness and safety) resulting from the use of a new treatment problem and other treatments that are already supported by the assessment of the efficacy and efficacy of the relevant public therapy in a given time. This assessment then requires the reliability of the data collected and a comparison of the results of the efficacy and safety of the new therapies already available in the treatment of a particular health problem. Based on the above, the effectiveness and safety assessment allows for an answer to the question of the magnitude of the health effect (both in terms of efficacy and security) expected in relation to the new therapy compared to other therapeutic options considered. The efficacy and Safety of sotorasib (SOT) used in adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NDRP) with KRAS G12C mutation has been assessed. A randomised open phase III study was included in the clinical analysis: • CodeBreaK 200 Clinical analyses included studies: • CodeBreaK 100 phase I/II, non-randomized, efficacy and safety assessment of sotorasib (SOT). Number of patients: Phase I 48, Phase II 126; Median follow-up period: Phase II: 15.3 months (1.1, Number of patients: P-CTH 241. The analysis also included practical efficacy studies: • Julve 2021 - retrospective study, 89 previously treated patients with metastatic MRLR with KRAS p.G12C mutation • Awad 2022 - two prospective studies, patients with locally advanced non-resectable or metastatic MRLsR with the presence of KRAs p.

(95% CI 3 patients died in the study: 1 in the SOT group (interstitial lung disease), 2 in the DOC group (intestinal obstruction, multi-organ failure). Adverse events ≥ grade 3 and treatment-related adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation occurred statistically significantly more frequently in the sotorasib group compared to docetaxel [RR (95%Cl) = 1.19 (1.01, 1.40) and RR (95%CI) = 2.33 (1.52, 3.57). Significantly less frequently with the sororasib treatment group compared with docetaxel were: • Total treatment-associated adverse events (RR (95% CL) = 0.82 (0.73, 0.92), • Dose-modifying treatment- related adverse events (95% CI) = 0.58 (0.37, 0.90)), • Serious adverse events related to treatment (SAE) (RR 95% CL)= 0.47, 0.80). No statistically significant differences between the analyzed groups in the treatment-based adverse events associated with discontinuation therapy, adverse events consistent with fatal, adverse event related to adverse events ≥ 3 have been demonstrated. An analysis of the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TEAE) occurring in ≥ 10% of patients with KRAS p.G12C mutations showed that the use of SOT compared to DOC was associated with: • higher risk of diarrhoea (total and ≥ 3 degree), increase in total ALT and increase in overall AST; • lower risk of occurrence: total fatigue, total alopecia, total anaemia, total mouth inflammation, total asthenia, total constipation, neutropenia (total &lt; ≥ 3 grade) and total peripheral neuropathy. Among adverse events reported in ≥10% of NDRP patients with a KRASA p. G12C were reported:  • IS higher relative risk: diarrhoea, increase in ALT and increased AST; and •IS lower relative risk of: fatigue, fever and peripheral oedema. • IS greater relative risk: diarrhoea, ALT increase and AST increase; •IS lower relative risk of fatigue, fever and peripheral oedema. SOT vs NIN + DOC (score) Adverse events reported with similar frequencies in the studies include diarrhoea (SOT 41% vs Nin+DOC 42%), nausea (Sot 26% vs Nino+DOc 24%), dyspnoea (19% vs 19%), cough (11% vs 26%), vomiting (13% vs 17%). decreased appetite (23% vs 22%). Patients treated with SOT were more likely to become constipation (13% versus 5%) and anaemia (17% vs 5%), and less frequent: fatigue (16% vs 30%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (11% versus 26%), increased alanine aminotransferase (1% vs 29%), alopecia (2%), neutropenia (2% vs 14%), and fever (7% vs 13%). In the study Julve 2021, overall adverse events (AE) were reported in 44% of patients, AE ≥3 grade in 9% of patients and AE leading to dose reduction in 19%. In the publication Awad 2022, AE related to treatment was reported in 65% of patients overall, AE associated with treatment ≥3 level overall in 23% of patients; AE associated therapy leading to discontinuation in 7% of patients. AE associated to treatment leading to a dose modification in 26% of subjects; AE related treatment related to death in 1% (1 death due to pneumonia) patients; SAE related to therapy in 26%. The most common (≥10% of patients) adverse reactions associated with total treatment reported in Avad 2022 were diarrhoea, nausea, increased ALP and increased ALT levels. Additional efficacy and safety analysis of Lumykras ChPL For very common adverse reactions (≥ 1/10) included anaemia, headache, cough, dyspnoea, diarrhoea, feeling sick (nausea), constipation, constipation, abdominal pain, joint pain, back pain, fatigue, fever, increased aspartate transaminase levels. vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, joint pain, back pain, fatigue, fever, increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase, elevated alanine aminotransferase. Restrictions The main limitation of clinical analysis is the lack of studies that allow a direct comparison of the technologies requested with comparators (nintedanib in combination with docetaxel, dual-drug chemotherapy based on platinum derivative, lemonexed). Between studies, e.g. CodeBreaK 200 and LUME-Lung1, there are significant differences that prevent intermediate comparisons. Also, some comparators have been omitted (athezolizumab, nivolumab), which according to the contents of the B.6 drug program could be used in patients not treated with immunotherapy in the first line. Available data are from open studies and the main study CodeBreak 200 (SOT vs DOC) and the CodeBraK 100 study are currently being conducted (the planned completion date is 2026/2027), so the final results are not available. Furthermore, studies are characterised by other limitations, eg. the study CodeBraK 200 allowed cross-over with regard to the results of cocetaxel may be significantly translated.",

      "text": "The economic evaluation, including the estimate of the costs to the health effects obtained, is based on an estimate and a comparison of the cost and health effects that can be associated with the use of a new treatment in a single patient instead of already refunded therapy. The cost of therapy is estimated in the currency of our country and the health outcomes are most frequently expressed in the years of life (LYG, life years guaranteed) or in the lifespan of survivors (QALY, quality adjusted life years) as a result of the treatment. The summary of the values and effects associated with using the new therapy and the comparison of them with the costs and effects of the therapy already reimbursed allows to obtain an answer to the question whether the health effect achieved in a new patient is higher than the treatment already refundable. The results obtained from the cost-health effect ratio compare with the so-called profitability threshold, i.e. the result which indicates that, when the wealth of our own country (expressed in GDP) is available, the maximum cost of the new treatment, which is due to achieve a single health effect (1 LYG or 1 QALY) is compared with the profitability threshold no longer than 175 per year. The cost-effectiveness threshold currently stands at PLN 175 926/QALY (3 x 58 642 PLN). The health effect ratio does not estimate and does not set the value of life, allows only an assessment and, among others, on this basis, make a choice of therapy related to potentially the best. An analysis of the utility of costs (CUA) was carried out in the lifetime horizon from the perspective of the public payer, an entity obliged to finance public benefits, i.e. the National Health Fund (NFZ) and from a common perspective, ie. NFZ and the recipient (patient). Sotorasib (SOT) compared to docetaxel (DOC), nintedanib in combination with docetaxels (NIN+DOC) and Pemetrexed (PMX). For comparison with dual-drug chemotherapy based on platinum derivative (P-CTH), a summary of the cost of treatment was presented. The results of CUA for the comparison of SOT vs DOC, SOT vs NIN+DOC, SOT vs PMX Incremental utility index (ICUR) from the perspective of the NFZ were: • relative to docetaxel (DOC): • versus nintedanib in combination with docetaxel. • with docetrexed (NIN+ DOC). • as compared to Pemetrexed (PMX): According to the applicant's estimates, the use of SOT instead of the estimated ICUR is the profitability threshold referred to in the Refund Act. versus Pemetrexed (PMX): According to the applicant's estimates, the use of SOT in place of the Estimated ICUR is based on the profitability threshold referred to in the Refund Act. A summary of costs for comparison SOT vs dual-drug chemotherapy based on platinum derivative (P-CTH) The estimated monthly costs were: • from about PLN 207.07 (cisplatin + paclitaxel scheme) to approx. PLN 1 857,18 (cisplatin + vinorelbin scheme) (the cost of drugs used in dual platinum-based chemotherapy depending on the scheme used); • approx 804,69 (cisplatin + docetaxel scheme) up to ok. PLN 2 722,46 (carboplatin + etoposide scheme), (the total cost of medicines and their administration). The cost-effectiveness of sotorasib relative to comparators is limited by the main limitation of economic analysis is the need to model health effects, as the time horizon of the analysis was much longer than that covered by the studies. Furthermore, there is uncertainty regarding the clinical performance results of the compared interventions, especially in terms of overall survival for the comparison of SOT vs DOC. Also, some comparators (athezolizumab, nivolumab) which according to the wording of the B.6 drug program may be used in patients not treated with immunotherapy in line I. Interpreting the above results should be taken into account for the limitations of clinical analysis, which also translate into economic analysis. Indication of the circumstances referred to in Article 13 (3) of the Act of 12 May 2011 on the refund of medicines, foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses and medical devices (Journal of Laws 2022 item 2555 with late amendments) If the clinical analysis of the applicant does not include randomised clinical studies demonstrating the superiority of medicines previously reimbursed in the indication, the official selling price of medicinal products must be calibrated in such a manner as to obtain the cost of the medical advice required. The Agency's opinion does not deal with the circumstances of Article 13 of the Refund Act. Assessment of the impact on the health system, including the public payer's budget The assessment of the effects on the healthcare system consists of two essential parts. Firstly, in an impact assessment on the payer'S budget, it is possible to estimate the potential expenditure related to the financing of the new therapy from public funds. Estimates regarding the expenditure related with the new treatment (scenario The analysis included costs identical to those included in the economic analysis. The applicant estimated the number of patients using the proposed technology in a new scenario for: • patients in the first year, • subjects in the second year. The results of the basic analysis indicate that the inclusion of the payment of Lumykras will be related to the expenditure of the public payer by ca. • in the 1st year • during the 2nd year of the refund. The option to include the refund of Lumikras is the cost of sotorasib in the option of refunding about 1 year and about 2nd years of refund, and in the Option The result of sensitivity analysis indicates that the limitations In the analysis of the budgetary impact of all indicated comparators for the requested technology. The estimations were made for docetaxel and the association of nintedanib with docetaxel. The possibility of treatment of Pemetrexed and bidrug chemotherapy based on platinum derived. Among the limitations, the uncertainty regarding the population size of the proposed treatment and the predicted shares of sotoratib was omitted. patients with the presence of p.G12C mutation in the KRAS gene at the current frequency of genetic tests in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NDRP). The costs of additional genetic tests if a refund is applied will also affect the expenditure of the public payer. The limited reliability is also affected by the limitations of clinical and economic analysis.",

      "text": "It is proposed to add to the programme an assessment of the quality of life of patients to obtain actual data from Polish clinical practice. One expert pointed out that the decision not to include in the patient's drug programme due to co-existence of other cancers should be a doctor's. The clause on exclusion of co-progress of other malignancies is one of the criteria for qualification for the drug programme under consideration. Discussion of the solutions proposed in the rationalization analysis The purpose of the rationalisation analysis is to identify a mechanism whose introduction will result in the release of public funds corresponding to at least an increase in costs resulting from a positive decision on the refund of the proposed medical technology. A rationalizational analysis is provided if the analysis of the impact on the budget of the entity obliged to finance public benefits shows an increase of reimbursement costs. In the submitted rationalization study, the applicant proposed solution is to discuss recommendations made in other countries with regard to the assessed technology 3 clinical recommendations for the proposed indication by: • The Polish Society for Clinical Oncology (PTOK 2022); • National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCNC 2023 v2); • the European Society of patients for Medical care of patients with the NDROS II (ESMO 2023). In the second treatment line of patients with NDRP with KRAS G12C sotorasib mutation, it is recommended to use in patients who have not responded to prior therapy. As other therapeutic options, platinum-based chemotherapy (progressed patients after the first line of treatment with monotherapy inhibitors) and adagrasib (FDA-registered therapy not registered by EMA) were identified. The NCCN 2023 guidelines in the second line of therapy of patients in NDRV with KRAS G12c mutation indicate the possibility of using sotorasib or adagrassib (after at least one prior therapy aimed at the KRASS G12 C mutation). According to the PTOK 2022 guidelines, treatment in the other line of treatments for patients with generalised non-small cell lung cancer depends on the clinical pathologic characteristics, effects of previous systemic treatment and molecular characterisation of the tumour. In this group, chemotherapy (docetaxel or petrochemicald), docetaxel in combination with nintedanib, EGFR inhibitors in patients who have not received these drugs in the first line, or ozymertinib in patients previously treated with EGFR-inhibitors of the first or second generation, ALK inhibitors in the event of re-arranged ALK gene, immunotherapy (nivolumab or atezolizumab), palliative radiation or symptomatic treatment. Refundal recommendations 4 positive reimbursement recommendations (NICE 2022, SMC 2022, HAS 2022, G-Ba 2022) were found, three of them were positive conditional recommendations with time limitation (SMC 2022, HAS 2022, GA 2022), and 1 negative recommendation (PBAC 2022). Cancer Drugs Fund). The provision of data from the CodeBreaK100 and CodeBreak200 study may reduce uncertainty in terms of cost-effectiveness estimates. Positive recommendations conditionally make a positive opinion conditional on the delivery of the final results of the studies for sotorasib. The negative decision draws attention to the uncertainty regarding the effectiveness and utility of the costs. According to the information provided by the applicant, Lumykras (sotorib) is funded in the EU and EFTA (at 30 indicated).",
