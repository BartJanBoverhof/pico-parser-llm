      "text": "In the absence of a clinical evaluation, the clinical trial is considered to be terminated. For primary prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma, vaccination against hepatitis B virus type II is recommended for all newborns and persons at increased risk 1.2 For all newborn mothers infected with hepatitis B type II, administration of the first vaccine and hepatitis B viral immunoglobulin is recommended up to 48 hours after delivery. 2.2 In selected cases, ultrasound surveillance may be performed in patients with advanced fibrosis without hepatic cirrhosis, especially if infected with hepatitis B and C viruses and patients with congenital haemochromatosis associated with a mutation in HFE. 2.3 Persons with co-occurring liver cancer, IVA, are recommended to be monitored for undesirable effects on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. 2.6 In patients with metabolic fatty liver without cirrhosis, ultrasound surveillance is not recommended due to a low risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. 2.7 In hepatitis II patients with cirrhotic liver A type C after elimination of the virus achieved by the use of antiviral drugs with direct action, the risk of liver cancer is substantially reduced, but not decreased, therefore continuous monitoring of the liver is recommended. High quality contrast imaging (4-phase computed tomography or dynamic magnetic resonance imaging) should be performed. The detection of atypical hepatocellular radiological features in contrast radiology allows the diagnosis of the tumour without performing a targeted biopsy. Diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis II, A should be based on non-invasive criteria and, in certain situations, should be supplemented by a pathomorphological diagnosis. 3.2 In patients with non-cirrhotic liver, the diagnosis of cancer in cirrhomon II,A should be confirmed by pathomorphic examination. 3.3 Due to the high sensitivity of the examination and the possibility of examining whole cell liver cancer in a patient with marrow cell cancer A, the detection of tumours with a high risk of growth in the marrow type II should be carried out by ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging in the first 3 months of follow-up. 3.5 In patients with cirrhosis of the liver, the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma II, A in tumours â‰¥ 1 cm in diameter may be based on non-invasive radiological criteria and, in certain clinical situations of uncertainty, complement the diagnosis with a pathomorphological evaluation. 3.6 In the case of inconsistent results of pathomorphic tests A or II, the observation of non-compatibility between the results of histopathological examinations and the result of subsequent follow-up ultrasound examinations may be extended to 6 months from the second year of regular observation. 4.Imaging tests 4.2.In the absence of a clinical diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, a repeat biopsy of the observed tumour is recommended. Imaging 4.2.For patients with risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma: 4.2.1.Ultrasound screening II, A is recommended every 6 months; 4.2.2.If focal lesions > 1 cm are detected on ultrasound, the diagnostic method should be multiphasic computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging; 4.2.3.If lesions> 1 cm, a typical radiographic image based on: (1) the occurrence of vascular enhancement (wash-in) and (2) subsequent wash-out enables the diagnosis of hepatocell cancer; 4.2.4.If only one of the criteria for the detection of liver cancer (wash in or wash out) is met, but at least one of these criteria is omitted, an additional 3 months of follow-up (biopsy) is required to diagnose the cancer (high risk of cancer) or 5.3. Pathomorphology 5.1. Microscopic diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is not IV, and the absolute requirement for treatment  should be limited to cases specified in the diagnostic procedure algorithms. 5.2. The clinician should provide the pathomorphologist with all relevant IV, A information regarding the patient, with particular regard to the oncological profile and data regarding liver disease and previously performed diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. 5.3. The liver biopsy should include tissue (non-cellular) material. IV,A 5.4. The content of the patomorphological report is dependent on the type of material provided for evaluation (IV,A vs. post-operative material). 5.5. The microscopic detection of cancer should include all possible histological and prognostic parameters from the histological stage of the cancer to the type, IV and A. 5.6. Immunohistochemical confirmation of hepatocytic origin IV, A is necessary in all G3 and selected G2 cancers. 5.8 Differential diagnosis of early and large grade III dysplastic tumour A requires the use of a panel of immuno-historical markers involving cancer, HSP70 and glypican GS-3.5.9 Diagnosis of highly mature hepatocellular carcinomas in non-marginal hepatocytes A, IV with differential growths in hepatic and non-globular tumours 5.10. Genetic diagnosis may help to identify certain II/III, B subtypes of hepatocellular carcinoma, but it still plays a limited role in the selection of targeted therapy. 6.6 Algorithm of action (progression grading and treatment regimen alignment) 6.1 Progression assessment systems for clinical decision-making in HCC II and A should simultaneously take into account the characteristics of the tumour, liver function and overall disease status. 6.2 The BCLC assessment system (diagnosis 2) has been validated repeatedly and individually, and is continuously improved on the basis of scientific evidence. levels of scientific evidence for different types of treatment according to their strength and magnitude of clinical benefit (Figure 3). 6.3. There is a concept of migration between different stages of III,B disease progression, which may result in changes in the selection of the optimal treatment. 6.4. Patients should be discussed in multidisciplinary teams so that III,A takes into account all changes in clinical status and dynamically adapts treatment options in an individualized manner. 6.5. The assessment of response to treatment in hepatocellular cancer should be II, A based on RECIST criteria in case of locoregional therapies. II, B In case of systemic therapy, mRECIST or RECIS systems are recommended. 6.6 For the assessment of response after resection, locoregional or systemic therapy II, multiphase computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging with contrast is recommended. 7.7 Surgical treatment 7.1. Liver resection 7.1.1 Primary hepatocellular carcinoma resection is the treatment of choice in patients with a single tumour, Child and Pugh A-scale liver function, absence of hypertension, normal bilirubin, platelet count > 100 000/ mm3, or a significant HbA-free hepatic pressure gradient of approximately 10 mm2. 7.1.2 Anatomical resections  segment ectomy, III bisegment ectome, C  including the area of arterial and portal vasculature are recommended. 7.1.3. The perioperative mortality of patients with cirrhosis of the liver II A should not exceed 23%. 7.1.4. Additional recommendations for resection of III, B multicenter hepatocellular cancers or single tumors in patients with portal hypertension and/ or in the Child and Pugh B groups, but beyond the scope of the transitional treatment plan, should be based on comparative positive outcomes with the post-treatment groups of intracranial cancer III A and intraregional cancer in the affected areas.  1540% III, A and extra-hepatic  5060%) affects approximately 70% of patients after tumour resection. The treatment strategy should then depend on re-evaluation in the classification of the progression. 7.1.6. The use of pre- and post-operative I, A adjunctive therapy is not currently recommended in patients undergoing dissection. The perioperative mortality should not exceed 3% and the annual  10% 7.2.2. Any extension or liberalization of the criteria for qualification for II, A liver transplantation should be at the discretion of the centre, based on experience, organ allocation conditions and prospective study results. 7.2.3. Locoregional (ablationary) treatment methods should be used, III, A if the expected transplantation waiting time exceeds 6 months (bridge to transplantation). 7.2.4. 7.2.5 Transplantation of a liver fragment from a living donor may constitute an III, B alternative in patients with an anticipated waiting period of more than 6 months; in such cases liberalization of the median criteria is possible, depending on the experience of the facility. 8.1.4 Thermoablation is recommended for the treatment of patients with 2 to 3 tumours of I, A up to 3 cm diameter who are not eligible for transplantation. 8.1.5. Both methods of thermoblation (using radiofrequency waves or microwave III, A) can be successfully used to treat patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Microwave thermoablation has an advantage in treating lesions > 3 cm in diameter and tumours located close to large blood vessels. 8.1.8 Immediately after thermoablation, multiphase III, A computed tomography with contrast should be performed to assess the completeness of the procedure. 8.1.9 The follow-up examination after ablation is magnetic resonance imaging (preferred II, A method) or multiphasic computed Tomography. These should be done on a schedule of 4-6 weeks post-operation, then every 3 months for 1 year and every 6 months for 3 consecutive years. Ultrasonography is not an appropriate method to monitor the effectiveness of ablation 8.10.1. Ultrasonography is not an appropriate method to monitor the effectiveness of ablation. 8.1.10.Bridging therapy and reduction of progression by locoregional II, B methods may be used when there is a high risk of disease progression preventing transplantation (bridging therapy) or it is possible to meet the median criteria under the condition of locoregional treatment (decreased progression). 8.2.Transcutaneous chemoembolization/Radioembolization 8.2.1 Transcutaneously chemoembolising is the standard of care (treatment I, first line A) in patients with BCLC group B. 8.2. 8.2.4 In a group of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma limited to I, B liver without large vessel perforation, in the Child Pugh B scale, ECOG 1, with changes in two hepatic lobes or with relapse of the disease, a potentially greater benefit can be derived from the use of molecular chemoembolization supplemented with conventional nasal swabs than the recommended renal swab. 8.2.7 Radioembolization may be used instead of percutaneous I, A chemoembolization as a bridging therapy for liver transplantation, providing longer time to progression. 8.2.8 Radioeembolization can be safely used in patients with Child and Pugh scale I,A hepatic function â‰¤ B7, portal vein perforation/ lesion (limited to the parietal branches), with no extrahepatic lesions 8.2.9 The use of a dosing regimen that is used for the planning of I radioembolization is indicated 8.10. Systemic therapy 9.1 In patients with non-surgical hepatocellular carcinoma in good general condition and with good liver function (Child and Pugha Class A), systemic therapy improves prognosis 9.2 In those without contraindications to first-line immunotherapy, the recommended treatment is the combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab. Regorafenib has only been studied in patients who are well tolerant of sorafenib I, B 9.7. In patients previously treated with Sorafenib with AFP â‰¥ 400 ng/ ml I, ramucyrumab C slightly prolongs overall survival. 9.8. Optimal systemic treatment has not been established for second-line III, B patients who have previously received bevacizumab with atezolizumab (however, patients may benefit from the use of sorafenib, leninivat or cabozantinib). 9.9. The value of stand-alone immunotherapy with controls at points I and B is not established. 9.10. Chemotherapy should not be used in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma I B. 9.11.",
