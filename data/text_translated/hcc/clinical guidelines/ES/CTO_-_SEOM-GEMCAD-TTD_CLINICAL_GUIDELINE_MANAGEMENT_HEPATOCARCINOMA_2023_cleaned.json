      "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy in the liver and is the third cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Surveillance with abdominal ultrasound should be offered to individuals at high risk for developing HCC.\nAccurate diagnosis, staging, and liver function are crucial when determining the optimal therapeutic approach. The BCLC\nstaging system is widely endorsed in Western countries. Managing this pathology requires a multidisciplinary, personalized\napproach, generally with a multimodal strategy. Surgery remains the only curative option, albeit local and systemic therapy\nmay also increase survival when surgery is not suitable. In advanced disease, systemic treatment should be offered to patients\nwith ECOG/PS 0-1 and Child–Pugh class A.\nKeywords Hepatocellular carcinoma · Guidelines · Diagnostic · Staging · Treatment\nIncidence and epidemiology in Western Europe, North America, and Japan, HCV infection is he predominant cause [3].\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most diagnosed The major risk factors are in flux, considering the declincancer and was the third leading cause of cancer mortality ing prevalence of HBV and HCV thanks to vaccine and worldwide in 2020, with approximately 906,000 new cases antiviral treatments [4, 5].
