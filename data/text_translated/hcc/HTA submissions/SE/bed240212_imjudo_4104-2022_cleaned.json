      "text": "• Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common cancer occurring in the liver; the prognosis for patients with HCC depends on whether curative treatment can be given; however, when medical treatment alone can be offered, median survival is less than one year. • Imjudo (tremelimumab) in combination with Imfinzi (durvalumab), is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced or non-resettable HCC. Both tremelimumab and durvalumab are so-called checkpoint inhibitors, which enhance the anti-tumour response of the immune system. • TLV considers that the relevant comparator alternative to Imjudo in combination with Imfinzi for the relevant patient population is the combination of Tecentriq (atezolizumab) plus bevacizumab, and when it is not appropriate, either sorafenib or Lenvima (lenvatinib). • Clinical efficacy and safety of Imudovumab in conjunction with Imzi has been compared with sorabenib in a randomised, open, phase III study (HIMALA) which had a higher overall survival rate (OS) but no progression in the outcome of immunosuppressive therapy. • Imfeminumab has been shown to be statistically significantly more relevant for the long-term survival of Imfimac than the placebo-controlled combination of Imfenib and Pfizer in a comparative clinical trial. • The effect of Imfinimac on the survival and disease progression of Immunosuppressants has been demonstrated to be significantly higher than that of the indirectly comparable treatment effects of both Imfinib and IFS in a clinical study. However, TLV applies the OS data of the sorafenib-arm from HIMALAYA in the health safety analysis against Lenvima. Regarding the PFS, it applies TLV results from the direct comparison study between soravenima and Lenfenib. • The recommended dose of Imjudo is 300 mg as a single dose administered in combination with Imfinzi 1 500 mg in 1 cycle over 1 day, followed by Imudo every 4 weeks as monotherapy. • Imfinsi comes in two packages. The reported price of Imjudo is SEK 251,527. • TLV is conducting three health economics analyses: a cost-benefit analysis with sorafenib as a comparator, a cost benefit analysis with Lenvima as comparator and a cost comparison with Tecentriq plus bevacizumab as the comparator. • In TLV' s baseline scenario, the cost per QALY gained is approximately SEK 2.4 million compared to Sorafenib and SEK 1.7 million in comparison to lenvima. • The cost of TLV comparison is that the treatment costs for Imfinzi plus imjudo are around SEK 490,000 higher than the treatment cost for Tecentrq plus be vacizumaB. • TL V' s cost comparisons are based on the assumed comparable effect in PFS and OS which is assumed to be seasonal and [monthly]. • The uncertainty of Imfenib in the TLV and OS is assessed primarily by the extrapolarity of the outcome of the analysis, whereas the safety of Imfinsi plus sorafinzi is questionable. In the analysis where Imfinzi plus Imjudo is compared with Lenvima, the extrapolation of OS, PFS and TTD as well as the selection of quality of life weights are associated with very high uncertainty. Compared to Tecentriq plus bevacizumab, the assumption of comparable efficacy is very uncertain.

According to TLV' s clinical expert, advanced and unresettable HCK are equated in Sweden and they are treated as advanced HCC; according to TL V' s medical expert, the national care programme is followed for first line treatment of advanced HCP. Thus, these patients are primarily treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, but if this is not appropriate, the patients are treated with lenvatinib or sorafe. Patients with increased bleeding tendencies and patients unsuitable for immunotherapy are, according to the TL V ' s cliniical expert, not suitable for treatment with atezumab + bevazizumab. According the expert, 50 to 75 percent of patients are governed by their different dietary patterns when choosing between sorafenib and lenvatizin, and according to local expert traditions, the choice of treating with bevavizumab or sorafenid is also influenced by the local traditions of the patients. 50 to 75% of patients are treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and 25 to 50% of patients with lenvatinib or sorafenib. TLV has not previously investigated the use of atezoizumab + bevazizumab, sorafenik or lenvatnib for the treatment of HCC but the NT Council recommends atezoazumab Plus bevavizumab for the current indication and both sorafenic and lenvatinig have general subsidy. The treatment of advanced HCC is not differentiated by whether the disease has a viral or non-viral etiology. According to TLV's clinical expert today, etiology is not taken into account in the selection of the treatment regimen. The expert believes that at present there is no evidence that etiology has any relevance for the response to treatment. I published the study from IM150 in which atezozizumab+ bevaxizumab was compared to bevajizumab as a treatment for HCC and no difference in efficacy was observed in patients with atherosclerosis (≥ 95%) in the subgroup of 1,05 to 1,68 patients with HCC plus sorafenil (≥ KIHRK1,63) [5]. According to the TLV clinical expert, this subgroup analysis can only be hypothetical and should be studied further. This interpretation is in line with the interpretation of the authors of the publication [5]. Furthermore, the expert has stated that there is a great need for treatment alternatives regardless of the etiology. Based on this, TLV considers that for this health-economic assessment, a division of the population into respective non-viral etiologies is not sufficiently justified.",

The TLV clinical expert considers that the study design, where a second course of STRIDE was possible for some patients, could be a treatment option for isolated patients in Sweden. In Sweden, patients are treated first-line with sorafenib or lenvatinib if atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is not appropriate. However, according to the TLV Clinical Expert, an equivalent efficacy of sorefenib/lenvatinib is expected irrespective of patients' suitability for atezoizumab + bevaziumab. EMA considers that the adverse reactions of STRIDE are significant, but that relatively few patients discontinue treatment and that most of the side effects are clinically manageable. EMA is of the opinion that the side effect profile of ST RIDE is not significantly worse than that of sorafenib.[2] TLV's clinical expert considers STRITE's side effects were expected and that they do not differ significantly from other studies with combined immunotherapy. Furthermore, the expert believes that the Grade 3 and 4 adverse effects were comparable in STRIDEs and sorabenibs, and that it was positive that STRIDA did not cause side effects.

      "text": "TLV estimates that there are uncertainties in the company' s modelling of OS and chooses to adjust the extrapolation of OS. This is described in the paragraphs below. In TLV' s baseline scenario, OS is extrapolated with the Hazard 1 distribution in both treatment arms. This means that a lower proportion of patients survive over time compared to the company ' s ex-trapolation. TLV presents susceptibility analyses in which OS is extrapolated to other distributions and presents a susceptability analysis in which the time horizon is shortened to ten years. In the TLV and the company' s extrapolation of OS, STRIDE has an efficacy advantage compared to sorafenib long-term follow-up in HIMALAYA. The company has shown that the risk of death in the respective STRIDES and phenibs during the subsequent follow up period is consistent with the KM estimate for the study comparison arm. At 10 years, the estimation of OS is in line with the expert estimate of approximately 03 percent. The company refers to several studies, including a systematic review study by Lin et al (2022) that compiled OSdata from 13 clinical trials of immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer, malignant melanoma and urothelial cancer [18]. The study shows that there is a difference in overall survival between patients treated with immunotherapies compared to chemotherapy for up to 60 months, and that the studies show support for long-term survival. TLV's clinical expert states that it is reasonable to expect that treatment with STRIDE in HCC may result in long survival for a proportion of patients. Based on the TLV expert's combined clinical studies and the company's pre-specification, the company assesses that TLV may be more reasonable for a certain proportion of STRIDS patients. TLV considers that it is reasonable to assume that the relative efficacy benefit of STRIDE compared to sorafenib begins to decrease gradually at 6 years. At 8 years, the risk of death is assumed to be the same in both treatment arms (HR=1). At these time points, only a small proportion of patients are still progression-free and on treatment according to extrapolated PFS and TTD curves (TTD, Time on Treatment). Approximately 97 percent have progressed by 6 years and approximately 2 percent are on treatment with STRIDA. TLV presents sensitivity analyses to show how the outcome is affected by other assumptions. Progression-free survival in the comparison between STRIDE and sorafenib The company' s modelling of PFS implies that the risk of progressing is [--------] for patients treated with STRIDE compared to sorapenib over a long period of time. TLV estimates that both the proportion of patients who are progression- free over time and the efficacy benefit assumed by the company may be overestimated. The company ' s modeling of the PFS and duration of treatment (TTD curve, see more in section 3.2.1) for STRIDA also imply that after a period, the percentage of patients are progress- free is [------------------------------------------]. TLV adjusts the extrapolated PFS curve to STRIDS by assuming the risk for progressing in both treatment cycles is the same at 35 months, which coincides with the 10th time point of the STRIDIE and KM curve (see KM Curve for PFS). Total survival and progression-free survival in the comparison between STRIDE and Lenvima TLV considers that there are uncertainties in the company' s modelling of OS and PFS for Lenvimi. TLV believes it is reasonable to assume a comparable efficacy between Lenimav and OS sorafenib since the baseline scenario of TLV is assumed to be the same as the extrapolated OS survival curve, see Figure 6. Regarding PFS, TLV considers that it is reasonable to assume that the efficacy of Lenvima is better than that of sorafenib. Therefore, in TLV's analysis, the PFS curve for Lenvema is extrapolated by applying a constant hazard quotient of 0,66 (from the RE-FLECT study [10]) to the extrapolled curve of sorabenib. Even with the aforementioned adjustments of OS and PFS for lenvima, the TLV assesses that there are uncertainties with the extrapolation as the data is based on the REFLECT TLV study. However, TL V considers the adjustments made make OS and pFS more consistent with the opinion of the FLECT study, the national healthcare and TLV programme experts on the effectiveness of LENVIMA in relation to the effect of soravenib. TLV' s assessment: TLV considers that the company' s modelling of OS and PFS is uncertain. TLV chooses to model OS for STRIDE and sorafenib with the Hazard 1 knot distribution and assumes that the efficacy benefit of STRIDES relative to OS decreases progressively between years 6 and 8.",

      "text": "There are uncertainties with the quality of life weights used by the company in its analysis. The EMA considers that the patient-reported outcome data are not clinically relevant, due in part to the open design of the study [2]. The TLV also notes that the quality-of-life weights for all conditions in both treatment arms are higher than the quality Of-life in the normal population for the corresponding age and gender distribution11. At the request of the TLV, the company has reported quality-Of-Life weights based on data converted to EQ-5D-3L and with the tariff of Dolan [13]. The TL V has considered using the quality -of-Life weight from the NICE evaluation of Lenimav [14]. The quality- Of-Life Weight in NICE's evaluation is 0.745 in progression-free condition and 0.678 in the progressive condition. The Quality of Life Weights from the CLIL study are difficult to reasonably use, but appear to be more useful than those from NICE. the study appears to be somewhat high, but whether the quality of life weights used by NICE are more reasonable to use is difficult to determine. TLV chooses to apply the HIMALAYA quality-of-life weights as they are obtained through the clinical study; TLV uses the EQ-5D-3L-converted weights in combination with the Dolan tariff; in addition, TLV applies state-specific quality- Of-Life weights. In TLV's analysis, the quality- of-life weightings are 0.814 in the progression-free state and 0.788 in the progressed state; in the sensitivity analysis TLV shows how the outcome is affected by the use of the same quality-Of-Life Weights as used in NICE's evaluation of Lenima. In addition to the above-mentioned differences between companies and the assumptions of TLV, the company has preferred to use the different scenarios of the treatment of the TLV. the company has argued that the quality of life weights in the baseline TLV scenario should be different between the treatment arms in the progression-free state. This is based on the fact that the study quality of Life was [-------------------------] for patients treated with STRIDE, and also because adverse reactions of grade 3 or higher were more common among the patients who were treated with sorafenib in the study.

      "text": "Prices of sorafenib Sorafenib is included in the Periodical Product System. TLV adjusts the price of soraphenib to the average selling price of the product that is the periodical product12 over three months. The average price of periodical products during the months of October, November and December is $ 24,029.13 If TLV were based on the average price for periodical goods during the month of December, January and February, the average cost would be $ 21,171. This has only a small impact on the outcome. Dosage and RDI for Lenima TLV clinical expert indicates that patients may need to adjust their dose to the lower dose due to side effects. The company assumes that the RDI of Lenima is 100 percent. For other tumour groups, according to the expert, re-introduction of the combination of CTLA4 antibody and PD1 antibody occurs if the combination is judged to have provided clinical benefit. The expert indicates that in some cases it may be possible to add a treatment regimen also for STRIDE. Like the company, TLV chooses to assume that treatment with STRIDA as well as treatment with sorafenib may continue after progression in accordance with the study HIMALAYA. Unlike the company TLV assumes that a certain percentage (7.6 percent) receives an additional dose of Imuduj in combination with Imemberzi with sorafinib after progress, which is assumed to be consistent with the clinical trial HIMALYA. 12 TLV is based on the first published list of the progression period. It does not take into account any changes in the TLV's progression rates during the 117-month period from April 2023 to June 2023. TLV also assumes that treatment with Lenvima can be continued after progression. This assumption is made to ensure consistency between the analyses. TLV lacks the TTD curve for Lenvime and assumes the ratio of Lenvim and sorafenib's PFS (HR 0.66) can be applied to the treatment duration. To extrapolate Lenvim' s TTD Curve, TLV applies a constant hazard ratio of 0.66 to the extrapolated TTD of sorafenim. Figure 9 presents the TTDS curves in the TLV baseline scenario, and Figure 10 presents TTDS and PFS curves for STRIDE, sorafenigib and Lenvim respectively in separate figures. In the HIMALAYA study, more than 40 percent14 of patients received follow-up treatment. According to the TLV expert, between 30  50 percent of patients in Sweden are receiving follow up treatment. The expert estimates that there is currently no established treatment after first-line treatment with Tecentriq plus bevacizumab, but according to the expert, sorafenib or Lenvima are used. He estimates the same treatment options may become relevant after first line treatment with STRIDE, but that Tecentrq plus be vacizuma b could also be considered. For patients who were first-lined with sorafeneb or Lenviima, Stivarga (regorafenib) or Cabometyx (kabozantinib) are recommended as follow-ups according to TLV' s expert. Individual patients who have received AFP may be considered for treatment with Cyramovir (ciramovirazumab) after first Line treatment withTecentriq, or Kostfenib, or be monitored for differences between patients who are treated with Lenviimab and those who are being treated with Striide. TLV considers that the company' s assumption is uncertain and therefore chooses to assume that the costs of care visits and monitoring for patients treated with sorafenib or Lenvima are the same as for those treated with STRIDE. TLV' s assessment: In the clinical trial HIMALAYA received a small proportion of patients to a dose of Imudojudo progression. TLV assumes that Lenvima treatment can be continued after progression, which is the same as the assumption made for STRIDE and sorafenib. TLV assumed that 40 percent of patients receive follow-up treatment. After treatment with Stride, half of the patients are assumed to receive soraphenib and half of those patients are considered to be receiving sorafenima. Patients treated with first-line Lenven or Lenven are equally divided between Stivarga (regorafenib) and Cabometyx (kabozantinib). TLV presents sensitivity analyses with other assumptions about follow-on treatments. The Company reports a cost comparison between STRIDE and Tecentriq plus bevacizumab. The Company' s cost comparisons include drug and drug administration costs. Based on the indirect comparison reported by the Company (see section 2.4.2), it is assumed that treatment with Tecentrq + bevazizumab would result in a longer progression-free survival compared to STRIDES. Therefore, drug and medication administration costs are calculated according to the PFS curves for the respective treatments. The time horizon of this analysis is [---] months.

The TLV cost comparison between STRIDE and Te centriq plus Bevacizumb shows that the high cost of treatment for STRIDI is approximately $490,000 higher than the cost of the comparator alternative.
