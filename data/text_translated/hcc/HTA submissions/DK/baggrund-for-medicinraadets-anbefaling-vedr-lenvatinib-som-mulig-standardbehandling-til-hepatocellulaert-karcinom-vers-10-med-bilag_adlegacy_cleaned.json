The limited significance is confirmed by clinical experts in the NICE evaluation of lenvatinib (Lenvima). The 7 days of wasting is assessed to be clinically plausible and is validated by a clinician. Applicants have chosen to exclude wasting in their main analysis. Other pre- and post-progression costs Other treatment costs are the costs associated specifically with either a progression-free disease stage (PFS stage) or disease phase (PD stage). The costs are thus not related to either lenvatnib (L envima) or sorafenib (Nexavar) treatment, but to the average time a patient stays in the given stage, which relates to which treatment the patient receives. The Applicant has estimated the resource use of treatment in PFS and is asked through the questionnaire collected about the resourced use of the sorafenub (nexavar). The estimate for the resoursed use of sorafenab has subsequently been provided by a Danish clinician (Nexvar). Applicant has subsequently had the estimates validated by a Danish clinician. Applicants have estimated consumption of number of outpatient visits to oncologist, AFP test, liver function test, INR, complete blood cell count, biochemical test, endoscopy, CT scan, MRI scan, hospitalization, nursing and home care. Valuation of resource consumption has been done on the basis of Danish laboratory medical guidelines, DRG and DAGS assessments 2018 and Amgros catalogue of unit costs.

Lenvatinib was nominally superior to\nsorafenib, HR was 0.856 with upper limit of the 95% CI <1 (95% CI: 0.736, 0.995], p=0.0342).\nAnalyses that adjust for imbalances in baseline characteristics that are considered prognostic of outcome, are likely to be the least biased and most applicable to patients, as stated in the EMA\n“Guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man”. In addition the HR also\nfavoured lenvatinib when OS was adjusted for the baseline imbalance in HCC aetiologies (HR 0.855,\n95% CI: 0.721 to 1.013).\nThese results confirm that the direction of imbalance between groups is likely to have biased OS in favour of sorafenib.\nPost-progression therapies\n“The Committee notes that there is not much difference in the proportion of patients who after the study received other medical treatment for their cancer disease between the lenvatinib and sorafenib\n(33% and 39%, respectively). Since the absolute and relative efficacy estimates do not detect\nstatistically significant or clinically significant differences in survival for lenvatinib compared to sorafenib, the expert estimates that lenvatinib does not offer any clinical added value to the survival\ntarget”\nComment\nThere was a notable imbalance between the treatment arms regarding the proportion of patients who received post-treatment anti-cancer therapy (including procedures and medications) during survival\nfollow-up.\nA higher proportion of subjects in the sorafenib than in the lenvatinib arm received post-treatment anticancer therapy: 51.1% (243/476) versus 43.1% (206/478) respectively)1. Further, a higher\nproportion of subjects in the sorafenib arm rather than in the lenvatinib arm (9.5% vs 3.1%) received\npost-treatment anticancer therapy with investigational drugs, including regorafenib, mostly within clinical trials. Additionally, 121 of the 156 patients that received an anticancer medication postprogression on lenvatinib received sorafenib2. This imbalance in treatment with new agents is an\nartifact of clinical trial design rather than reflective of clinical practice.\n In the overall population, the HR (95% CI) for lenvatinib versus sorafenib was 0.87 (0.75,\n1.01) in the adjusted analysis (post-hoc analysis of OS results adjusted by use of posttreatment anti-cancer therapy) compared with 0.92 (0.79, 1.06) in the unadjusted analysis\n Furthermore, as per the exploratory analysis provided in the response document3, lenvatinib first-line followed by any subsequent anti-cancer medication demonstrated a longer OS than\nsorafenib followed by any subsequent anti-cancer medication. Patients who received any\nsubsequent medication had a 4-month OS benefit if they began on lenvatinib vs sorafenib (21 vs 17 months)\nThese results also confirm that the direction of imbalance in subsequent therapies is likely to have biased OS in favour of sorafenib.\nAdverse events\n“Overall, the committee considers that there are no significant differences in the adverse reaction profiles, which mean that a product is preferred over the other”\nComment\nLenvatinib and sorafenib have safety profiles that are consistent with other VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapies; however, the nature and extent of adverse events (AEs) differed between the two agents\nbased on their different mechanisms of action.

The QoL impact of lenvatinib and sorafenib was broadly equivalent across the majority of\nfunction and symptom areas; however it is notable that there was a statistically significant and\nclinically meaningful delay in worsening for lenvatinib compared with sorafenib across several domains including diarrhoea, nutrition and pain.\nMedical Council's assessment of clinical added value for lenvatinib for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma\n“The Medicines Council finds that lenvatinib and sorafenib can be treated as first line therapy in patients with HCC”\nComment\nEisai would like to thank the Medicines Council for considering the evidence and providing Danish patients access to a treatment alternative in first line therapy for HCC.\nConclusion\nThe REFLECT trial is the first study in 10 years to demonstrate a proven overall survival benefit by statistical confirmation of non-inferiority when compared with sorafenib, and as such represents an\nadvancement in HCC therapy.\nThe clinical benefits of Lenvatinib were demonstrated in the REFLECT trial, a randomized, multicenter, head-to-head, open-label Phase III study comparing lenvatinib to sorafenib, which\nshowed:\n Non-inferiority of OS: 13.6-month median OS (95% CI: 12.1-14.9) vs 12.3 months (95% CI:\n10.4-13.9) (HR: 0.92 [95% CI: 0.79-1.06])\n A statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement across all secondary efficacy endpoints:\n4 Harandi A, Zaidi AS, Stocker AM, Laber DA.

      "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a less frequently occurring cancer in Denmark, which occurs most often in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.[1] The liver function of patients with liver diseases such as cirrhoea can be divided according to how good the liver function is and is referred to in the Child-Pugh A, B and C categories, from best to worst liver function. There are about 430 new cases of HCC per year, with men accounting for just under 3⁄4 of the cases.[2] At the end of 2015, 652 patients had HCC, reflecting the low survival for this patient group. Thus, the one-year survival rate is 37% for men and 40% for women, while the five-year survivability is only 9% for males and 11% for females.[2] Currently, HCC constitutes a disease in which the Barcelona Liver Cancer Clinic (BCLC) system has been used to divide the stage of liver function and the physical status of the patient, as well as to determine the benefit of the tumor-related cancer, after which treatment is often decided. Patients with early disease (BCLC A) are evaluated for surgical removal of the liver, transplantation or percutaneous ablation (i.e. destruction of cancer cells by chemical interventions or hyper/hypothermia, where in particular radiofrequency therapy (RFA) has been introduced in Denmark) with the possibility of recovery. Five-year survival is about 50-75 % dependent on treatment [3]. Patients at intermediate stage (BBC) have large or multiple liver tumors and have liver function similar to BCC and are offered symptomatic treatment [3]. Patients with disease at this stage are evaluated for local chemotherapy in the liver (transarterial chemoembolization) [3] In the advanced stage (BCLC stage C), patients still have liver function equivalent to Child-Pugh A or B, but are no longer candidates for local treatment as they have cancer symptoms and/or vascular invasion or spread outside the liver [3] They are thus evaluated with a view to first-line systemic therapy with the multicinase inhibitor sorafenib.",

Adjusted for duration of treatment, 1.59 events/ patient-year were observed in the lenvatinib arm and 1.80 events/patient-year in the sorafenib arm. The difference between the two treatments is 0.20 events/ patients-years in favour of lenvatitinib, which is a larger difference than the predefined limit of 0.18 events / patients-year, corresponding to a 10% relative increase or reduction. The relative efficacy estimate (rate ratio) of 0.89 [0.78; 1.01] indicates that the risk of an adverse event per patient year is lower for lenvatininib than for Sorafenib. However, the difference is not statistically significant, placing lenvatinib in the category of no clinical value. As a qualitative review of adverse reactions to the above quantitative assessments, the Adverse Reactions Committee has sought to describe below the differences in adverse reaction profiles for the Lenvatinib and Dafenib tablets. Increased protein excretion from the kidneys (proteinuria) was observed in 25% of patients treated with lenvatinib, whereas the corresponding figure for sorafenib was 11%.

Quality of evidence Very low HR: Hazard ratio For patients treated with lenvatinib or sorafenib, the median time to progression was 7.4 and 3.7 month respectively. According to the EPAR for lenvatinib [10], the Applicant is using a censorship method in the analysis of the progression-free survival data which may result in overestimation of the efficacy of Lenvatinib. This is due to the fact that more patients drop out of the study in the lenvatinini arm than in the sorafenib arm. There are therefore more censors in the Lenvatini arm, which means that any progression events are not included into the analysis. If the analysis is adjusted so that the censorship takes into account the disparity in the number of patients leaving the study, the difference in progression free survival at 3.6 months is HR 0.72 [0.63; 0.83]. The Panel concludes that the two analyses produce consistent low results. As the minimum clinically relevant difference in the quality of the evidence is very important for the clinical efficacy goal to be achieved. Since the smallest clinically relevant difference has been achieved, the efficacy endpoint is assigned an important clinical added value.

      "text": "Currently, there are limited systemic treatment options available for 1st line unresectable HCC patients:\nsorafenib is the only systemic agent that has been approved for first line treatment of advanced HCC. There\nis a significant need for new treatments in advanced unresectable HCC that delay progression without negatively impacting patients’ HRQoL.\nLenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor with a novel binding mode that inhibits VEGF receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), FGF receptors (FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4) and other RTKs\ninvolved in tumor proliferation (including platelet derived growth factor receptor PDGFRα, KIT, and RET).\nLenvatinib has been approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have received no prior systematic therapy.\nLenvatinib is the first treatment in 10 years to demonstrate a proven overall survival benefit by statistical confirmation of non-inferiority versus sorafenib. In addition:\n- Lenvatinib demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in terms of\nprogression-free survival (PFS) compared with sorafenib.\n- Importantly, results from the EORTC-QLQ (C30 and HCC18) suggest that lenvatinib treatment leads\nto a clinically meaningful delay in several HRQoL domains, including Role Functioning, Pain,\nDiarrhoea, Body Image, and Nutrition.\n- The adverse event profile of lenvatinib is manageable and predictable.\nIn addition, in the context of the assessment of OS it is important to note the following:\n Imbalances in baseline characteristics which were potentially important prognostic factors may affect the treatment benefit seen with lenvatinib. Baseline imbalances of note in REFLECT included\nthe proportion of patients with AFP levels ≥200 ng/mL (46.4% in the lenvatinib arm and 39.3% in\nthe sorafenib arm) and the proportion of patients with an aetiology of HCV (19% in the lenvatinib arm (and 26.5% in the sorafenib arm).\no Notably, after adjustment for imbalances in baseline AFP, lenvatinib was found to be nominally superior to sorafenib in terms of OS. In the presence of imbalances for strong\npredictors of outcomes, adjustment for such covariates generally improves the precision of the analysis\n More patients had post-progression treatment in the sorafenib arm than in the lenvatinib arm (51% of patients in the sorafenib group had post-progression treatment compared with only 43% in the\nlenvatinib group). As a result the overall survival results may favour sorafenib.\no When adjusted for post-treatment anticancer therapy, the HR for OS favoured lenvatinib\n Finally, the exploratory analysis presented in section 5.1.3 demonstrate that, based on the REFLECT\ndata adjusted for imbalances in baseline characteristics an incremental mean OS benefit of at least three months may be reasonable\nLenvatinib represents advancement in the management of HCC. Several other investigational therapies\nhave failed to meet non-inferiority or superiority endpoints for OS versus sorafenib. Patients should be\ngiven the opportunity to get the best possible treatment options. Lenvatinib introduction will lead to a\npredictable and manageable budget impact due to a small target population and no additional resource requirement for the treatment of adverse events.",

As per the protocol only the phase 3 study REFLECT is used in this the assessment [4].\nREFLECT was a multicenter, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority phase 3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib versus sorafenib as a first-line systemic treatment in subjects with unresectable\nHCC.\nA total of 954 subjects who met all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria were randomised in a 1:1\nratio to one of the following treatment groups:\n Lenvatinib: 12 mg (if baseline BW ≥60 kg) or 8 mg (if baseline BW <60 kg) QD oral dosing\n Sorafenib: 400 mg twice daily (BID) oral dosing\nAllocation of randomisation numbers was performed using an interactive voice/web response system\n(IxRS®) based on the following stratification factors:\n Region: Region 1 (Asia-Pacific); Region 2 (Western regions, such as EU, North America, other)\n Macroscopic portal vein invasion (MPVI) or extrahepatic spread or both: Yes; No\n Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS): PS = 0; PS = 1\n BW: <60 kg; ≥60 kg.\nEnrolment in Study 304 occurred between 01 Mar 2013 (first subject gave informed consent) and 30 Jul\n2015 (last subject enrolled) at 183 study sites (number of sites initiated) in Asia, North America, European\nUnion, Russia, and Israel [2]. A resulting total of 154 sites in 20 countries were involved in this study [1].\nThe data cut-off for the primary analysis occurred on 13 Nov 2016 after the occurrence of 700 deaths.\nA total of 1,492 subjects were screened for entry into the study. Of these, 538 subjects were screening\nfailures, and 954 subjects (63.9%) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lenvatinib (478\nsubjects) or sorafenib (476 subjects). Of the 954 randomised subjects, two in the lenvatinib and one in the\nsorafenib arm were not treated. The two subjects in the lenvatinib arm were not treated because they met\nexclusion criteria and were randomised in error. The subject in the sorafenib arm chose not to take study\ntreatment. Therefore, 476 subjects in the lenvatinib and 475 subjects in the sorafenib arm received at least\none dose of study treatment (Figure 4.1).\nInclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in appendices, Table 7.2.\nFIGURE 4.1: TRIAL PROFILE [1]\nA non-inferiority test of overall survival (OS) between lenvatinib and sorafenib was done using a 2-sided\n95% confidence interval (CI) of hazard ratio (HR) (lenvatinib:sorafenib). The HR and the corresponding 2sided 95% CI were estimated using a Cox proportional hazard model with treatment group as a factor, and\nstratified by the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors.\nSuperiority hypotheses were tested for OS using a stratified log-rank test with the randomisation (IxRS) stratification factors. No multiplicity adjustments were needed for testing of the non-inferiority and\nsuperiority of OS due to the closed testing principle. Two interim analyses were performed. Since the study\nwas not stopped at the first or second interim analysis, non-inferiority for OS was tested first at the final analysis with a non-inferiority margin of 1.08, which indicated that lenvatinib preserved at least 60%\n(corresponding to δ = 0.60) of the sorafenib treatment effect versus placebo as observed in the sorafenib\nSHARP and Asia-Pacific trials [5,6]. Non-inferiority was declared if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for\nHR was <1.08 at the final analysis. If non-inferiority was declared for OS, then superiority (corresponding to\nδ =1) was to be tested for OS. Superiority would be declared if the 2-sided P value was <0.05 using the\nstratified log-rank test at the final analysis.\nAs of the data cut-off date of 13 Nov 2016, the median duration of survival follow-up was 27.7 months in\nthe lenvatinib arm and 27.2 months in the sorafenib arm.\nThe lenvatinib and sorafenib arms were generally well balanced with regard to baseline HCC disease characteristics and disease history with some exceptions.\n The proportion of subjects with baseline alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels ≥200 ng/mL (an adverse prognostic factor in HCC), was greater in the lenvatinib arm than in the sorafenib arm: 46% vs 39%,\nrespectively.\n In addition, the proportion of subjects with an HCC aetiology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) was higher in the sorafenib arm than in the lenvatinib arm (26% vs 19%, respectively), an imbalance that may\nfavor sorafenib, since HCV aetiology has been recently shown to be a predictive indicator for sorafenib treatment effect and subjects with HCV appear to derive more clinical benefit from\nsorafenib therapy than subjects with other aetiologies, particularly hepatitis B virus (HBV) [7].\nAn overview of the REFLECT study can be found in appendices, Table 7.2.",

This is also applicable to treatment discontinuation where the\npublished article presents treatment-related TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation whereas EMA’s scientific discussion presents either any AEs as a primary reason(s) or any TEAEs leading to treatment\ndiscontinuation [1,2].\nProgression-free survival (PFS)\nFor PFS, censoring rules followed Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance [11], where patients were censored when they discontinued treatment for any reason other than disease progression.",

Furthermore, the overall rate of response (ORR) in the lenvatinib arm was more than double the ORR\nin the sorafenib arm: 24.1% and 9.2%, respectively. The difference between the treatment arms was 14.8%\n(95% CI: 10.2, 19.4), and the odds ratio was 3.13 (95% CI: 2.15, 4.56), which was statistically significant\n(P<0.00001) in favor of lenvatinib treatment. Six subjects in the lenvatinib arm had a CR (1.3%) compared\nwith 2 subjects (<1%) in the sorafenib arm, and 22.8% of lenvatinib compared with 8.8% of sorafenib\nsubjects had PR. Stable disease occurred in 51.5% of subjects in the lenvatinib and 51.3% in the sorafenib\narm.\nThe increased ORR to lenvatinib is relevant in clinical practice because lenvatinib is highly effective in reducing tumor size, and achievement of tumor downstaging facilitates the use of more curative treatments\n(e.g., resection, ablation, and superselective cTACE), which in turn improves patient survival even further\nIn addition, lenvatinib and sorafenib have safety profiles that are consistent with other VEGF/VEGFRtargeted therapies; however, the nature and extent of adverse events (AEs) differed between the two agents\nbased on their different mechanisms of action. The most frequently (>30% of patients) reported TEAEs were\nhypertension, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, and weight decreased with lenvatinib and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, diarrhoea, and hypertension with sorafenib. The AE profile of lenvatinib may\nbe more favourable compared with sorafenib from a patient perspective due to lower rates of palmar plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome and diarrhoea, which can have a substantial impact for patients.\nIn conclusion, giving physicians and, most importantly, patients an alternative treatment option, depending on individual patient characteristics, will provide the opportunity for a personalised\napproach ensuring patients receive the most appropriate treatment as early as possible. Lenvatinib,\nwith its distinctive side-effect profile, and statistically and clinically significant response rates in comparison to current standard of care, can provide a meaningful benefit to patients who currently\nhave no other treatment options.\n5.

The efficacy target is therefore a measure of safety of treatment, and the SCCS considers it to be an important efficacy goal.

If discrepancies are found, a possible reason for this should be given. If there is a lack of data from the pre-defined PICO study descriptions, additional trial data must be made available, in particular to justify the absence of a meaningful effect in relation to a specific endpoint, and not to replace all data with meaningful data for this endpoint. For efficacy measures (ORR, SAE, treatment discontinuation due to adverse events and non-serious adverse reactions) where it is natural to calculate both absolute and relative difference, the relative difference will be the basis for statistical analyses. The absolute difference will then be calculated based on the estimated relative difference for an assumed level of the incidence rate in the comparator group. The assumed levels will reflect the expected level in Denmark for treatment with comparator (if relative risk (RR) = 0.5 and the proportion of incidence in the comparable group is 30%, then the absolute risk reduction (RAR) is assumed to be 30  30 x 0.5 = 15%). If there is more than one comparative study, a meta-analysis of the efficacy objectives should be carried out where methodologically justified. If there is more than one comparative study, a meta-analysis shall be performed for the endpoints where this is methodologically justified. If no comparative studies are available, data may be synthesised indirectly (e.g. in the form of formal network meta analyses or by using the Bucher method) if the intervention and comparator are compared with the same alternative comparator in separate studies.
