      "text": "The Commission considers that the medical service provided by LENVIMA is insufficient in relation to the therapies available to justify a national solidarity approach in the extension of the HAS-directive indication. Taking into account: - the demonstration of non-inferiority (without demonstrated superiority) of lenvatinib compared to sorafenib in terms of overall survival and the methodological limitations of this demonstration: - a very select population (Child-Pugh A, ECOG 0 or 1) with no histological evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma required, - an open-label study, - the possibility for patients in the Lenvatinib group to be treated with Sorafenib if the disease progressed when the reverse was not possible, - choice of the non-infertility threshold of 1.08, corresponding to a consistent loss of efficacy of 40% of the effect of sorafeninib versus placebo, - French tolerance to unattended severe outcomes (patients not identified as having Aspirin-independent hepatocytomatocarcinoma) in patients who would not be eligible for treatment with sorafennib in the same pharmacology class, but who would have a higher mortality rate than those in the French Pharmacovigilance Committee, and in particular those patients who were not eligible to receive a medical grade ≥ 3 history of renal cancer from the same group, Medical, Economic and Public Health Evaluation 2/ 25 ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATIONS AND REGULATIONS Date of Initiation (Centralized Procedure): 28/05/2015 Date of Extension of Indication (Object of the Opinion): 20/08/2018 Engagement in the MPAA: an observational study to characterize the overall toxicity profile of advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in adult patients who have not received prior systemic therapy, including those with relapsed childhood disease, and to include data on tolerance in patients with recurrent conditions, including in Europe.

The laboratory claims a significant SMR and an ASMR V compared to NEXAVAR (sorafenib) in a restricted range of MMAI, i. e. in patients with preserved hepatic function (Child Pugh stage A).  For information, NEXACAR was granted an MMA in October 2007 in the  treatment of HCC . Lenvatinib is a tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor that selectively inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, in addition to other proangiogenic and oncogenic pathway-linked TK receptors including fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGF), platelet-derived growth factor receiver (PDGF) and KIT and RET receptors. In this indication, the Commission considered that the RMS of KISPLYX was insufficient to warrant national solidarity management.  THERAPY INDICATIONS  LENVIMA is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of adult patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (papilloma, follicular, Hürthle cell) or locally advanced metastatic, radioactive and refractory metastases (RAI). The recommended daily dose of lenvatinib is 8 mg (two 4 mg capsules) once daily for patients weighing < 60 kg and 12 mg (three 4 mg tablets) once a day for patients weighting ≥ 60 kg. 4 mg Stop Stop until occurrence (one 4 mg capsule) by resolution to Grade 0 (same effect or 1 or 2 new effects) Third 4 mg days Stop Until occurrence (4 mg capsules) by resolutions to Grades 0 (the same effect or 2 or 3 new effects). Toxicity with a life-threatening effect (Grade 4): Stop a. Treat nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea before stopping or reducing the dose. b. Reduce the dose gradually based on the previous dose (12 mg, 8 mg, 4 mg or 4 mg every other day). c. Haematological or protein toxicity: no adjustment of the first dose is necessary for the first occurrence. For haematological toxicity, administration may be resumed upon resolution to Grade 2; for proteinuria, resumption of administration at resolution to less than 2 g/24 h. e. With the exception of biological abnormalities considered not to imply a life-threatening prognosis, which can be managed as Grade 3 effects.  MEDICAL NEEDS Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common of the liver cancers (approximately 90%) 1 with an estimated incidence in France of approximately 9,600 new cases per year in 2018 2. This type of liver cancer develops most often on a renal cirrhosis (80% to 90% of cases) of various types (primary hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, diabetes mellitus). The prognosis of primary liver cancer remains one of the worst of all cancers with a 5-year survival rate of less than 15%.3 The management of HCC depends on the stage of the disease and the general condition of the patients4,5,6,7. Unlike other solid tumors, for which the therapeutic decision is made based on the TNM classification, there is no consensus prognostic classification for HCC7. Therefore, several classifications or scores have been proposed including the  Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer  (BCLC) 8 classification which has the advantage of enabling a prognosis stratification and proposing a treatment algorithm. When HCC is at an early stage (BC 0-A), patients are generally eligible for curative treatment by surgery, radiosurgery or transplantation. In case of failure, refractory disease or ineligibility for TACE, or in the presence of vascular invasion and/ or extrahepatic injury (advanced stage CLC), treatment with sorafenib is recommended in patients with preserved general condition (ECOG ≤ 2) and preserved hepatic function (Child-Pugh A). In adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (stage BCLC B or C) who have not received prior systemic therapy, the medical need is therefore considered to be partially met by sorafenib. However, there remains a medical need for better tolerated and/ or more effective treatments at this stage of the disease.",

Lancet. 2018;391:1163-1173 Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01761266 Demonstrate non-inferiority in terms of overall survival (OS) of lenvatinib compared to sorafenib Primary primary line of treatment for patients with unresecable liver cell carcinomas. November 2016 Scope and location of 183 centres in Asia, North America, European Union (14 centres in France including 52 patients in the study), Russia and Israel. The study consists of 3 phases (see figure below): - a pre-randomisation phase, consisting of a screening and inclusion period; - a randomisation phase, which extends to the date of analysis of the main outcome, which includes a treatment period and a follow-up period in case of discontinuation of the study before the analysis date; - and an extension phase, for subjects still in the trial at the study date who will continue on current treatment or who have stopped treatment.  Adults ≥ 18 years of age with a histological or cytological diagnosis of unresectable hepatocarcinoma or a clinical diagnosis established according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria  ≥ 1 hepatic or non-hepatic lesion measurable by the low mRECIST criteria  Subjects classified as Stage B (not eligible for chemoembolism) or C by the BCLC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer) classification  Stage A Child-Pugh score  Adequately controlled arterial pressure with or without antihypertensive therapy  ECOG score of 0 to 1  Estimated significant survival ≥ 12 weeks  Prior history of systemic cardiovascular disease measured by the mRICIST criteria ≥ 6 months  Congestive heart failure, angina, heart attack or stroke requiring a first dose of antibiotics in patients with ≥ 50% or more of the patient' s blood volume before treatment  Non- invasive heart disease, congestive cardiac arrest or heart attack  Gastric or oesophageal varices requiring treatment within 28 days prior to randomisation  Patients with brain metastases *Pre-cancer therapy was allowed only if it was adjunctive or topical therapy administered concomitantly with surgery Experimental group: Lenvatinib PO 1 time per day (J=1J28). Treatments were administered until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, at the request of the patient or withdrawal of consent. Note that patients in the lenvatinib group could receive sorafenib in case of progression of disease, whereas those in the Sorafenib group could not receive post-progression according to the Lenvatinib MAG. * Dose jumps, dose reductions or discontinuations were permitted in the event of lenvatnib-related toxicity. in a 1:1 ratio (lenvatinib vs. sorafenib) and stratified by: - Geographical region: Asia-Pacific vs. western regions (EU, US etc.) - Gate and/ or extrahepatic vein invasion: yes vs. no n - ECOG performance score: PS = 0 vs. Total survival (SG) defined as the time between randomization and death from any cause* cipal * Censorship at the cut-off date for patients whose death was not documented at the time of analysis or at the date of last contact for patients who lost sight or withdrew their consent Hierarchical secondary outcome criteria:  Progression-free Survival (PFS) defined by the time from the date on which they were randomized to the date when the disease first progressed or when they died.  * Progress to death (TPH) determined by the length of time between randomisation and date of death from all causes* cf. Exploratory secondary outcome criteria:  Disease control rate (not presented in this document)  Clinical benefit rate (no presentation here)  Quality of life assessed using the generic questionnaire EQ5D-3L (not shown here) In order to highlight in the final analysis a difference of approximately 2.5 months between the two treatment groups in favour of the lenvatinib group (10 months vs 12.5 months; HR = 0.8), with a confidence interval non-inferiority threshold of HR 1.08 (justification of the below non-infectiousness threshhold), the following 700 events were expected for the main event analysis (ITT) and 666 for the PP (Tensibility Analysis) at the end of the analysis. Therefore, the number of subjects needed was estimated at 940 (470 in each group) to achieve a potency of approximately 97% with a risk α of 0.05 for SG (taking into account the annual rate of major deviations of 5%, the inclusion rate of 39 patients per month and the duration of inclusion of 24 months). It should be noted that assuming a real HR for overall survival of 0.8 in favour of lenvatinib, the potency associated with the demonstration of superiority of Lenvatinib would be approximated from Intermediate and Final Randomised Analyses. Efficacy and quality of life analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat population (ITT population = patients analysed according to their randomisation group). A sensitivity analysis was performed on the per-protocol population (population PP = patients analyzed according to randomization group for patients who received at least one dose of alyse treatment). Hazard ratios and CI were estimated using a stratified Cox model. If the upper bound of the LIC was less than the non-inferiority bound equal to 1.08, then non-inferriority of lenvatinib vs sorafenib could be claimed at the bilateral alpha risk of 0.05 and the superiority of the MHSR 9/25 could then be tested at the same threshold. Using the meta-analytical method proposed by Parmar et al. 19989, the HR pool estimate of overall survival of soraphenib vs placebo is 0.69; [0.57; IC 0.83]. (10.7 months vs 7.9 months; HR = 0.69) and the Asia-Pacific trial11 (6.5 months vs 4.2; HR= 0.68). The threshold of not less than 1.08 was estimated using the upper limit of confidence method of Rothmann et al. 2003 and corresponds to a preservation of at least 60% of the true effect of sorafenib vs placebo. In case of non-inferiority established on the primary endpoint, the secondary endpoints were tested in a hierarchical manner (for superiority). No specific alpha risk control was performed for the multiplicity of assays on the primary outcome criterion (non-inferiority and superiority) taking into account the closed testing procedure ( closed testing ). In the absence of an inferiority of the primary criteria, the secondary outcome criteria were tested in a hierarchical bi-lateral alpha risk test which allowed for the control of the alpha risk of 0.05 as an exploratory case, followed by a negative evaluation of the outcomes of secondary criteria. In total, 3 amendments to the protocol have been made since its first version on 12 November 2012. The 1st amendment (6 January 2014) mainly consisted of additions and clarifications regarding certain selection criteria (pre-cancer treatment, concomitant treatment, etc.), the addition of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire as a secondary quality of life assessment criterion (with updated statistical analysis), and the modification of the follow-up time for overall survival (life expectancy 2 to 3 months). The following two amendments consisted in amendments and clarification regarding the events that were expected to occur in the analyses. It should also be noted that there has been a change in the planned analyses, as all efficacy analyses have been performed on stratification factors recorded in the interactive voice/web response system (IxRS) instead of the randomization factors reported in the CRF as established in the initial protocol.",

Patients with non-alcoholic liver disease (NAC) were treated differently depending on lenvatinib concentration. Patients with non-alcoholic liver disease (NAS) differed depending on the concentration of lenvatinib; treatment did not vary between groups: on average, 8 patients (0.8%) had prior conventional medicine treatment (radiotherapy and ectomy in 28.1% of cases) with minor violations of the clinical and physiological protocols (3.3%) Sorafenib Group (n = 476) 5 (1.1) compared to 60 (12.6) and Public Health (Public Health) treatment (lenvatinib and SH) in 1.9%, and combination with other anticancer agents in 70.3% of cases, 11.4% of cases received a Chinese or foreign treatment. * The percentages of patients with cirrhosis at inclusion are from the clinical study report. Masatoshi et al. 12 reported 75% of patients who had cirrhotic disease based on a retrospective analysis by an independent imaging review panel.  Main outcome criterion: overall survival (OS) The median duration of patient follow-up, defined as the median time between the date of randomization and the death or cut-off date (13 November 2016), was 27.7 months in the lenvatinib group and 27.2 months in sorafenib. The non-inferiority of lenvatinib to sorafenib in overall survival was established statistically significantly at the 5% bilateral risk (upper bound of the HR confidence interval below the pre-specified non-subsistence limit of 1.08); however, the superiority of Lenvatinib compared to Sorafenib was not demonstrated (value 1 being within the confidence interval). At the time of the analysis (13 November 2016), the treatment tolerance population (SAS population) comprised 951 patients, including 476 in the lenvatinib group and 475 in the sorafenib group.  Adverse reactions (AE) At least 1 AE was reported in 98.7% (470/476) of the Lenvatinib patients and 99.4% (472/475) of the Sorafenib patients. The most common adverse reactions (> 20% in each treatment group) are described in the table below: Table 3: Most common ADRs (REFLECT-304 study  SAS population) Lenvatinib group Sorafenib group Adverse reaction (n = 476) (n= 475) n (%) n (5%) Hypertension 2012) 144 (30.3) Diarrhoea 184 (38.7) 220 (46.3) Decreased appetite 162 (34.0) 127 (26.7) Weight loss 147 (30.9) 106 (22.3) Fatigue 141 (29.6) 119 (25.1) Hand-foot syndrome 128 (26.9) 249 (52.4) Proteinuria 117 (24.6) 54 (11.4) Dysphonia 113 (23.7) 57 (12.0) Alopecia tolerated safety (24.4) 14 (25.9) SAS group (population analysis) By weight, the incidence of hypertension was increased by 22.3% (34.0%) vs. 30.6% (24.7%) and the incidences of proteinuria were reduced by 26.3% (32.0% vs. 22.6%) in the sorafenib treatment group, respectively. For information, the rate of investigator-related RSI was 93.9% in the lenvatinib group vs. 95.2% in the sorafenib group. the percentage of Grade 3 to 5 RSI appeared to be higher in the Lenvatinib Group compared to the Sorafenib Group (75.0% vs. The most frequent AEs (> 2% in each treatment group) are shown in the table below.

      "text": "LENVIMA is covered by a Risk Management Plan (RMP) which was updated on 27 June 2018 (version 10.6):  Significant risks identified: o Hypertension, o Proteinuria, o Insufficient or impaired renal function, o Hypokalemia, o Heart Failure, o Reversible Posterior Encephalopathy Syndrome, o Hepatotoxicity, o Haemorrhagic events, o Arterial thromboembolism, o QTc-valley prolongation, o Hypocalcaemia, o Hyperthyroid, o Gastrointestinal perforations and fistulas, o Non-Gastro intestinal Fistulas.  Potential major risks are: o Venous thromboembolic events with insufficient progesterone, o Renal failure, o Ovarian excretion, o Cardiac insufficiency, o Inflammation of breast milk, o Hepatic impairment, o Long-term use of CYP3A4 in patients with abnormal ovarian cycles, o Urinary atrophy, and other medical conditions. Summary & discussion The application to change the conditions of authorisation of LENVIMA (lenvatinib) for its extension of indication  as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy  is based on an open-label phase III non-inferiority study (REFLECT-104) comparing lenvatinib to sorafenib in 954 CHC patients with unimpaired hepatic function (Child Pugh) and general preserved status (EC-1). The demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between the groups. The patients were predominantly male, with a median age of 62 years, 79.5% had advanced stage C HCC according to the BCLC classification (Barcelona Clinic liver cancer) or intermediate stage B and were ineligible for chemoembolization (20.5%). The patients had not received prior systemic therapy. At baseline (13/11/2013), after a median follow-up of 27.7 months in the lenvatinib group and 27.2 months in sorafenib, non-inferiority was demonstrated with respect to overall survival (principal endpoint) for lenvitinib compared to sorafenab, with median overall survivorship (OS) of 13.6 months compared to 12.3 months for sorafenub (HR = 0.92; [0.79; 1.06]; no predefined inferiority threshold = 1.08). For example, among patients who received post-progression therapy, 77.6% received sorafenib and 9.6% received a clinical trial drug in the lenvatinib group, while 30.4% were re-treated with soraphenib and 24.5% participated in clinical trials. Finally, the superiority of lenvatinib over sorafenib in overall survival was tested but not demonstrated; however, it should be noted that lenvitinib was shown to be superior to Sorafenib on the following ranked secondary endpoints: progression-free survival (7.4 months vs. 3.7 months; Δ = 3.7 month; HR = 0.66; CI [0.57; 0.77]; p < 0.00001), time to progression (8.9 months versus 3.7months; ∆ = 5.2 months; HR= 0.63 ; IC [0.53 ; 0.73]; p< 0.00001) and objective response rate (24.1% vs. 9.2%; Δ = 14.8%; CI = 3.08 OR [2.128; 4.48]; P < 0.0001). The objective response rate (24.1% vs 9.2%; ∆ = 14.8%; OR = 3.08; CI [2.12; 4.48]; p < 0.00001) was not conclusive in the analysis of quality of life (hierarchical secondary endpoint) using the EORTC QLQ-C30 (cancer-specific questionnaire) and EORTSQ-HCC-18 (supplement to the HCC specific QLX-C30) questionnaires, given the open methodology and the absence of a pre-specified objective in the clinical relevance analysis. The rates of Grade > 3 adverse events (75.0% vs. 66.5%), GGEIs (43.1% vs. 30.3%) and MIEs leading to discontinuation of treatment (19.7% vs. 14.5%) appear to be higher with lenvatinib than with sorafenib. The GGE reported more frequently in the Lenvatinib group compared to the Sorafenib group were hepatic encephalopathy (4.4% vs. 0.6%), hepatic insufficiency (2.9% vs. 1.7%), and decreased appetite (2.3% versus 0.4%). Arterial thromboembolic events, haemorrhagic events, hypothyroidism and renal events were also observed with a higher incidence in the lenvatinib group compared to the sorafenib group.  Overall, the RECTEFL-304 study demonstrated non-inferiority in terms of overall survival (main judgement criterion) compared to Lenvatinib, with no evidence of systemic hemocytopenia, hepatocellular carcinoma (HEC) in patients with advanced or non-treatment-resistant CHD, and generally no pre-existing systemic HEC in patients receiving treatment. However, the Commission points out that the scope of the results is severely limited by: - The conduct of the open-label study when a double-blind study was possible, possibly inducing a measurement bias with respect to overall survival and the secondary hierarchical criteria of response to treatment; - The absence of robust quality of life data due to the open nature of the study and the lack of a pre-defined endpoint; - the partial crossover i. e. the possibility for patients in the lenvatinib group to receive sorafenib therapy after progression, whereas the sorafeninib group were not allowed to receive lenvatnib, which may have favoured the lenvitinib group for overall survivorship, - the transferability of results between them to the French population without assessing the absence or histological evidence of treatment response. The known tolerability profile of lenvatinib is characterised by a higher number of serious adverse events, grade 3 adverse reactions and treatment-related deaths compared to sorafenib, including hepatotoxicity, hypertension and loss of appetite and weight. In total, taking into account: - available clinical data from an open-label study to demonstrate the non-inferiority (and possibly superiority) of lenvatinib compared to sorafenib in terms of overall survival, - identified methodological limitations that do not allow the results of the study to be considered robust, - the transferability of the results to the uninsured French population considering the profile of the patients included in the study not in line with the French Epidemiology; - the unfavourable toxicity profile of lenvitinib in comparison to Sorafenib (hepatotoxicity, significant haemorrhagic and thromboembolic events, no life-threatening hypothyroidism, etc.) in the CHIMA-group, and the expected number of deaths and non-life-impacting events in the grade 3 treatment group, in relation to the quality of life of the subjects treated with Lenvatinib. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), phase Ib studies are underway evaluating the combination of lenvatinib with pembrolizumab or nivolumab. A phase II study is also underway, evaluating tolerability of the treatment chosen by the physician after a first line of treatment with lenvitinib. Lenvatinib is also being developed for first-line treatment of metastatic renal carcinoma, including in combination with pembrolizumab or leverolimus, for melanoma, head and neck cancer, or advanced endometrial cancer in conjunction with Pembrolizaumab (an ongoing Phase III study). PLACE IN THE THERAPE STRATEGY The management of HCC depends on the stage of the disease and the general condition of the patients. In case of ineligibility for TACE or in the presence of vascular invasion and/ or extrahepatic impairment (stage BCLC C), in patients with a preserved general condition (ECOG 0-2) and good hepatic function (Child-Pugh A), sorafenib therapy is recommended. A note recommendations13,14,15,16 place lenvatinib as a first-line alternative to sorafennib without identifying the population that could benefit from treatment (i. e. not at risk of not being eligible for or contraindicated by the use of sorafeninib). The ESMO13 and EASL14 recommendations specify that lenvatinib should only be used as a first-line treatment in patients without biliary tract involvement, portal trunk involvement or > 50% liver volume (according to the study selection criteria). In patients with very advanced disease (BCLC D), only palliative care or inclusion in a clinical trial is recommended. Taking into account: - the demonstration of non-inferiority (without demonstrated superiority) of lenvatinib compared to sorafenib in terms of overall survival and the methodological limitations of this demonstration: - a very select population (Child-Pugh A, ECOG 0 or 1) with no histological evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, - an open-label study, - the possibility for patients in the lenvitinib group to be treated with sorafeninib in case of disease progression whereas the reverse was not possible, - choice of the non-infertility threshold of 1.08, corresponding to a 40% consistent loss of efficacy of the serious placebo-induced reversible effect, - non-identifiable susceptibility of the clinically unsuccessful patients to the results of the French studies, but the prevalence of patients receiving lenvetinib would be higher than that of those in the French group (such as patients who would be eligible for treatment with Sorafenib), and in particular the risk profile of patients from the French-originating group ≥ 3 years old, who would not be able to tolerate the risk of death due to medical complications,",
