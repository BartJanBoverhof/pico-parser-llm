The Medical Council assesses whether new medicinal products and new indications can be recommended as possible standard treatment and prepares common regional treatment guidelines. New medicinal products are assessed in relation to efficacy, existing treatment and price. It should provide lower prices and medicinal products that are of the greatest benefit to patients. The common regional treatment guidelines are assessments of which medicines are most appropriate for the treatment of patients in a therapeutic area and thus the basis for uniformly high quality for patients across hospitals and regions.",

This gives a difference in median time to progression of 3.7 months. This exceeds the difference of 3 months pre-defined by the specialist committee as clinically relevant. The relative efficacy difference shows that there is a significant difference in progression-free survival between the two groups. Hazard ratio was 0.66 [0.57; 0.77].

The quality of evidence is estimated to be very low. The Scientific Committee has primarily stressed that there is no clinically significant or significantly different survival benefit at lenvatinib compared to standard therapy. The Scientific Committee notes that a long-term progression-free survival does not necessarily result in an increase in the quality of life of HCC patients, as some patients will be symptom-free despite progression. The Scientific Committee notes that the applicant has not provided data showing a significant difference in the quality of life between lenvatinib and standard treatment.",

Work on the protocol has been initiated on the basis of the preliminary application for lenvatinib received on 25.05.2018. The protocol forms the basis for the final application for the evaluation of the clinical added value of lenvatinib compared to standard Danish treatment.

Liver function in patients with liver diseases such as cirrhosis can be broken down by how good liver function is, and is referred to in the Child-Pugh A, B and C categories, from best to worst liver function. By the end of 2015, 652 patients had HCC, reflecting the low survival rate for this patient group.

Patients with early disease (BCLC A) are assessed for surgical removal of tumor, liver transplant or percutaneous ablation (destruct of cancer cells using chemical substances or hyper-/hypothermia, in which radiofrequency treatment (RFA) has gained in particular in Denmark) with recovery and a five-year survival of about 50-75 % depending on treatment [3].",
