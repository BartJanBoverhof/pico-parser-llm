In Sweden, approximately 500 patients are diagnosed annually with HCC. Metastases occur primarily in lymph nodes, lungs and erythrocytes. [1] The main risk factor for HCC is liver cirrhosis. More than two thirds of HCC occurs in cirrhotic liver lesions, but HCC may, especially in non-alcoholic fatty liver, chronic hepatitis B and porphyria, also occur in liver cirrhosis without cirrhosis. Etiological risk factors to HCC are mainly viruses (hepatitis B and C), toxic liver damage (alcohol and aflatoxin) and metabolic diseases (di-abetes, fatty liver hepatitis, haemochromatosis, porphyria). In patients with liver cirrhosis, they have hepatitis B or hepatitis C at the highest risk of cancer, but in hepatitis C, the cancer risk of hepatitis C decreases the cancer risk of hepatitis C is resolved.

Binding of CTLA-4 to the ligands CD80 and CD86 limits T-cell activation. Tremelimumab blocks this, increasing T-cell activation and proliferation. [2.3] Durvalumab is a human IgG1∞ monoclonal antibody that binds to programmed cell death-ligand-1, PD-L1. This blocks PD-L1 from binding to PD-1 and CD80, preventing reduction of cytotoxic T-cell activity, proliferation and cytokin production. [2]",

TLV estimates that there are uncertainties in the company's development of OS and chooses to adjust the extrapolation of OS. This is described in the paragraphs below. In TLV's baseline scenario, the OS is extrapolated with the distribution of Hazard 1 knot in both treatments. This means that a lower proportion of patients survive over time compared to the company's ex-trapolation. TLV has consulted clinical expert on the survival of patients treated in the first line with sorafenib in Sweden.
