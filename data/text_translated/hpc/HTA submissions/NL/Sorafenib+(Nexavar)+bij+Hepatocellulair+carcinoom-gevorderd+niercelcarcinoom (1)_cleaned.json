Cheung (020) 797 88 10 Subject Review sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma Dear Mr Klink, In your letter of 6 December 2007 you asked the Health Insurance College (CVZ) to carry out an assessment on whether the medicine Nexavar® (sorafenib) is interchangeable with a means included in the insured package. If this is not the case, ask for an assessment of the therapeutic value of this medicine for the indication for which compensation has been requested. Sorafenib is currently included in Appendix 1B and Annex 2 of the Health Insurance Scheme. This assessment is about a new indication, namely the application of sorafenib in the treatment of hepatocellular cancer (liver cancer).",

The standard treatment for the subgroup of patients with advanced disease consists of the best supportive care. The therapeutic value has been compared with placebo treatment. The CFH concludes that: The limited available literature indicates that patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who are deliberately curative or (continuation of) locoregional or local palliative treatment is not possible or considered non-medically-sensituous (allergic hepatocellular carcinoma), had a longer survival if they were using sorafenib than when using placebo. When using sorafenib, certain serious side effects occur more frequently than in placebo, particularly hypertension, diarrhoea, lymphoedema, abdominal pain and hand foot skin reaction.

Scope Epidemiology.Hepatocellular carcinoma is newly diagnosed in an estimated 560,000 people per year, worldwide.1 In the Netherlands, a total of 1964 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were registered (1964/12 = 164/year).2 The male female ratio was 2.4:1.In 2000 the standardised incidence was 1.6/100 000 men and 0.3/100 000 women. There was no increase over time. Risk factors in Europe include: hepatitis C (60-70%), alcohol consumption (20%), hepatitis B (10-15%), and others (10%).Prognosis.In the period 1989-2000, the 5-year survival rate, regardless of the stage of disease, was 5% in the cancer region under investigation, Amsterdam and the South Netherlands.2 In a European study over 1990-1994 was the 5-year survival 7% and the 1-year survival 22%.2 Stadium classification.",

Efficacy and efficacy Since hepatocellular carcinoma has poor prognosis, relevant outcome measures: duration of survival and time to progression. Positive effects of sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma have been found in a phase II study,4 and in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase III study not published as an article, but whose data are present in the EPAR1 and in a clinical study report in the application dossier. The standard dose was 400 mg twice daily per os. The phase II study involved 137 patients (71% males; median age: 69 years), of whom 72% with Child-Pugh A stage and 28% with Child-Pugh B liver function.

This results in approximately 116-145 patients being eligible for treatment with sorafenib at any time during the further course of their disease. It is expected that the number of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma will increase due to an increase in the number of hepatitis B or C. 2.2 Dosage and duration of use The recommended dose of sorafenib is 400 mg twice daily. Treatment should be continued as long as the patient has a medical benefit or until unacceptable toxicity occurs.
