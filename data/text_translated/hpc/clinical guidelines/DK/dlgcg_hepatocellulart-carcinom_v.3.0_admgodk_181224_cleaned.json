HCC occurs in 70-80% of cases in a cirrotic liver. Purpose The overall objective of the guideline is to support evidence-based high and uniform quality cancer interventions across Denmark. Patient group The most common cause of cirrhosis (about 65%) in Denmark is alcohol overconsumption (2). Incident and prevalence of cirrhosis are relatively stable, but the underlying causes change in these years, as alcohol-related cirrhosis and Hep B+C decline, while fat-related cirrhosis have an increasing trend. Diagnostics and treatment of HCC involve doctors from various specialities, including internal medications with hepatic function (hereinafter referred to as hepatolog), HPB surgeons/ transplant surgeons, oncologists, radiologs, interventional radiologists and pathologists. Since HCC are mostly accompanied by an underlying chronic liver disease, treatment of HCC will be more complicated than one sees than the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Denmark.",

Finally, it must be decided which action an abnormal screening test should trigger. Until very recently, screening for HCC has been widespread despite the lack of evidence of the beneficial effect of the screening procedure.
