The Center is characterized by a lower incidence both compared to the North (-39% in men and -19% in women) and to the South. The difference between North and South can be explained by the different incidence of infection with hepatitis viruses and in particular with the hepatitis C virus (HCV).

It is estimated that, in the presence of currently available treatments, periodic surveillance of patients with cirrhosis by liver ultrasound for early detection of the HCC produces a satisfactory cost-benefit ratio when the incidence of disease in the controlled population exceeds 1.5%2.

Therefore, it is called focal lesion, a lesion that emerges from the ultrasound background in a more distinct way (with the normal ultrasound probes per abdomen) or other imaging technique, and that generally has dimensions of at least 5 mm10. The pathway of hepatic carcinogenicity in 90% of the cases occurs in stages, with a progression from the regenerative micronodule (not visible to imaging techniques) to the regenerative macronodule (sometimes visible to the imaging, with dimensions exceeding 5 mm) on which they take place mutagenic alterations that lead to a slight dysplasia at first then progressively severe until the onset of a regenerative macronodule (sometimes visible to the imaging)",

Among the parameters expressing the synthetic function the most informative are the plasma levels of albumin, prothrombin time or INR (as the liver is the most important place of synthesis of the coagulation factors), cholesterol and cholinesterase.

These data are almost never available for the HCC on cirrhosis as the surgical approach is only available in a minority of cases and does not provide for the lymphoadenectomy due to the risk of ascitic decompensation. Therefore, the morphological stage is almost exclusively based on imaging techniques.

However, in practice, liver transplantation is applicable to a very limited fraction of patients who are cirrhotic with HCC due to clinical and oncology limitations associated with organisational and social considerations. Therefore, given the limited availability of organs, the use of transplantation should be based on the concept of equity between the different categories of patients and cannot be independent of the calculation of the survival benefit provided to the individual patient with transplantation compared to the expected results with other possible anticancer treatments Best results in terms of survival (75-80% to 5 years) after transplantation",
