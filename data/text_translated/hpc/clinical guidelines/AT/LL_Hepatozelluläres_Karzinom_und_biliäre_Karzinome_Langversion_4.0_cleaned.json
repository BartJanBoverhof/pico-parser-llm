Thus, the risk of radiation-induced liver disease (RILD, radioation-induced liver disease) and of side effects in critical neighbouring organs such as stomach, duodenum, small intestine and colon can be significantly reduced. Through these developments, the SBRT can increasingly be used for inoperable HCC and for bridging in the context of transplantation.

The calculation of an overall survival adjusted for cross-over resulted in a median survival time of 5.1 months for placebo and was significantly shorter compared to the verum group [775]. Thus, a subgroup of patients seems to benefit significantly from the therapy.

The aim of their use is to continuously improve the supply by presenting, critically reflecting and improving the results of the supply. The present selection of quality indicators has been prepared in accordance with the methodology of the Oncology guidance programme [783]. For the derivation process, a \"Quality Indicators Working Group\" (AG QI) was established, which produced the final set of quality indicators on the basis of the already existing quality indicators of the HCC 2013, the new strong recommendations (\"soll) of the updated HCC/CCA guideline, the results of the existing quality indicators from the certified liver cancer centres (HCC only) of the German Cancer Society as well as the results of the search for existing national and international quality indicators.
