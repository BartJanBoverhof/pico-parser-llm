The vol- ume of the future remaining winter must exceed 40% of the total hepatic volume. Therefore, when right hepatectomy is considered, prior right portal vein embolization is often required; surgery is performed only if sufficient hypertrophy of the left life is induced.Under these circumstances, postoperative mortality is < 5%, and 5-year OS and non-recurrence rates approximately 50% and 30%, respective [19]. Due to improved selection of patients, periodic management and surgical age is induced.Under these circumstances, postoperative mortality is < 5%, and 5-year OS and non-recurrence rates approximately 50% and 30%, respective [19].
