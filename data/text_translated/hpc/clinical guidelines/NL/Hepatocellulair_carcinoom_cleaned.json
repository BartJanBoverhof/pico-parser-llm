The directive deals with the following topics: Surveillance, Diagnosing, stereotactical radiotherapy, palliative system therapy, radioembolism, surgery, follow-up and aftercare. For whom is this directive intended? The directive applies to all adult patients with HCC and adult patients with increased risk of HCC who need to be included in a surveillance program. Where the directive is limited to patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. The directive is intended for all professionals involved in the second or third line in the surveillance, diagnostics, treatment and supervision of patients with HCC.

In addition, the possibility of HCC therapy in case of detection of HCC and the a priori risk of HCC and prevalence of benign noduli in this patient play a role. Patients with an increased risk of HCC are: Patients with hepatic cirrhosis. Patients with hepatitis B without cirrhosis but with additional risk increasing factors such as familial HCC, (south) east Asian man > 40 years*, (south) east Asian woman > 50 years*, Sub- Sahara African > 20 years. Talk to the patient: Participation in liver cancer surveillance is a choice that knows both for and disadvantages; as liver cancer is detected, there is more often a curative stage to treat with better chances of survival.",

Recommendation Consider in patients with cirrhosis with suspicion of HCC seen on the echo in the primary diagnostics MRI with contrast instead of CT. Given the cost, there is a preference for extracellular gadolinium over liver-specific contrast. If the MRI is technically, for example, by implants, or from the patient's point of view (e.g. claustrophobia), this can be replaced by CT. When the diagnosis of HCC is made with CT, additional MRI is only required when consequences are expected with respect to the policy.

Recommendation Inform patients and family/nearness about the possible occurrence of complaints after treatment of HCC. Mark these early effects of cancer using a (validated) screening tool. This screening should be used from diagnosis to treatment and follow-up. Considerations Disease and treatment have major consequences The Health Council concludes that many patients, after a deliberate curative treatment for cancer, suffer from complaints (Health Council, 2007). These complaints may be limited or extensive, both physical and psychological, and may occur early or later. This is called \"distress.\" Distress means: an unpleasant emotional experience of psychological (cognitive, behavioral, emotional), social and/or spiritual nature that can interfere with the ability to deal effectively with cancer, the physical symptoms and the associated with it.",

Because of relatively limited financial resources, finding a feasible and meaningful endpoint is also a challenge. In the Netherlands and other countries, TARE is currently part of the reimbursed care for HCC. TARE is routine care, which makes it more difficult to carry out (comparative) studies. Patients and treatment providers often have a preference for the study arm (TARE) compared to the control arm (TATE). Moreover, the difficult and long-term inclusion of the PREMIERE study (Salem, 2016) is an example of this. As a result, the resulting studies often have a limited study population, despite long-term inclusion, and were often terminated prematurely. Moreover, the data available is limited and does not go beyond progression-free survival.",

In patients who have in advance doubts as to whether adequate margins can be achieved by, for example, a central location or nearby large blood vessel, neoadjuvant TACE may be considered for the purpose of reducing the size of the lesions and thus obtaining adequate margins. However, Row 6: Row 7: There were significant differences between the different studies in the materials used and the interval between TACE and ablation. At present, there is no unambiguous recommendation as to which techniques are preferred (RFA or MWA, conventional TACE or drug-eluting bead TACE) or the interval to be maintained between TACE and ablation (Hendriks, 2021).",

In the studies, the so-called body surface area (BSA) method has been used to calculate the activity to be administered. This method does not take into account the actual dose in the tumour and in the surrounding liver tissue, and leads to structural underdosage.
