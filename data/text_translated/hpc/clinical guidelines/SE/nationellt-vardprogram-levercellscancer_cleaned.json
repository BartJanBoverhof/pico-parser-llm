The overall survival of the group has improved during the period we have had national care programs in Sweden, probably thanks to an increased proportion of active treatment. After completed curative treatment (ablation, resection or transplantation) the 5-year survival rate in the median is 40-75%, while the relatively large group of HCC patients with advanced tumour burden, poor liver function or reduced general condition, who can only be offered symptom relief treatment, has a median survival of less than 1 year. The treatment chosen depends largely on tumour factors and liver function, but differs a part in different parts of the country. Our hope is that the care program will contribute to more equivalent care. Liver disease may pose a significant risk for the development of HCC, which is why HCC monitoring is recommended for some target groups. HCC monitoring is organised according to the conditions in each region. Recommendations have been coordinated with more equivalent care.",

In Sweden, approximately 500 people per year are diagnosed with HCC. The proportion of patients with cirrhosis due to metabolic diseases (mainly MASLD) is expected to increase in the coming years. Primary prevention of HCC is based on treating underlying liver disease and risk factors for disease progression (such as alcohol consumption, diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity) to prevent cirrhosis development and thereby reduce the incidence of HCC through early diagnosis and treatment. Acute intermittent porphyria leads to an increased risk of developing HCC uta other underlying liver disease. • Risk groups should be screened for hepatitis B and C. • Hepatitis B vaccination should be offered to risk groups. • Hepatitis B prophylaxis should be given to neonates whose mothers have hepatitis B. • Treatment of chronic hepatitis B should be offered to patients with high rice fibrosis or HCC. • Risk groups for hepatitis B vaccination should be offered to risk groups.",

Chronic viral hepatitis (B and/or C), alcohol-related liver disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease [MASLD] – previously referred to as non-alcoholic fatal liver disease [NAFLD]) are the most common liver diseases associated with HCC [1, 4].

The incidence of HCC in Sweden is strongly associated with gender, age and cause. Men have approximately 4 times higher incidence of HCC compared to women (8 vs. 2/100,000), and HCC is a relatively rare form of cancer among people younger than 50 years [10]. However, the age-specific incidence increases significantly with increasing age (fig. 1).

Median survival for patients receiving palliative therapy varies from 8 months to 3 years. In up to 40 % of all newly discovered cases of HCC, it is not possible to offer active antitumour therapy at all.

New Swedish studies have shown that liver cirrhosis is often underreported among patients diagnosed with HCC in Sweden and that the real proportion of underlying liver cirrhosis among patients with HCC is thus greater than previously reported [2]. Similarly, MASLD is an increasing and often understated cause of HCC in Sweden [17].

There are national recommendations for antiviral therapy for hepatitis B [25]. New antiviral medicines for hepatitis D infection have been received, which are considered the most severe form of viral hepatitis with a higher risk of liver cancer than mono-hepatitis B infection [29]. Treatment with direct acting antiviral drugs (DAA) is recommended to all chronic carriers of hepatitis C and leads to healing in > 95% [30].

A Swedish study suggests that people of Asian origin have this higher HCC risk even after moving to Sweden [41, 111]. Even in Africa, hepatitis B perinatal or early childhood spreads.",

The DAA treatment in patients with established hepatitis C cirrhosis reduces the risk of HCC development [124]. The HCC risk of hepatitis C with cirrhosis is estimated to be about 1-2 % per year [38, 125]. HCC monitoring is recommended for patients with hepatitis C-related cirrhosis with both active and pre-treatment hepatitis C.

In case of impaired liver function or limited multifocality, liver transplantation is preferable, but in turn requires limited co-morbidity. In case of large singular tumor, liver resection is often possible, but requires good liver function. In established HCC, ablation is first-hand choice, due to good tolerability and low frequency of complication, which may also allow treatment for fragile patients. In the choice of resection or ablation, several factors must be weighed in addition to size, such as localisation, co-morbidity and liver function.

The worse liver function, the stronger the indication for transplantation [230, 232]. However, transplantation can only be offered to patients with tumour burden within selection criteria (see section 11.4 Liver transplantation (LTx) at HCC). Resection/ablation is usually the first choice in patients with cirrhosis and preserved liver function, Child-Pugh A, especially with Child-Pugh 5 points and less tumour burden, since the differences in 5-year survival compared to transplantation are limited [232-234]. Liver resection provides lower tumour-free 5-year survival than transplantation, but possibly with the possibility of ointment transplantation [230, 235]. In small tumours, < 3 cm, ablation is often a suitable option as it can be performed with fewer complications, shorter treatment time and lower cost than resection [77].",

Since ablation is not appropriate due to localisation or tumour size, but liver function well preserved, resection is recommended. In case of multiple tumours or relapse of HCC (not local relapse) after previous resection or ablation, liver transplantation should be considered [230], as relapse risk is lower after transplantation. However, both resection and ablation are common curative treatment options also in case of multiple tumours and/or relapse. Precise limit for these treatment options is difficult to define, but in a large proportion of international studies and guidelines where the value of resection of multifocal HCC is discussed, the limit is drawn at 2-3 lesions [16, 77, 236] The individual case is drawn.",

Local therapy minimises the volume of healthy liver that is removed. The disadvantage is that the risk of incomplete tumour destruction and local recurrence is higher than for resection. There is a limitation on how large tumours that can be treated by an adequate margin (where 3 cm is a common limit). Larger tumors can be treated but with an increased risk of relapse.

Ablation can be performed using laparoscopic technology, as well as in open surgery, if accessibility or location means that percutaneous treatment is not adequately assessed. The number of percutaneous ablations performed has increased significantly over the past decade, partly due to better evidence of the ablation effect and its tolerability, but also thanks to technical method development.

Initially, these considerations should be discussed. and the consequences should be supported by a multi-professional team in nutrition, oncology and palliative care. Cortisone can stimulate appetite, possibly give a little more energy and increase well-being. It can be given in shorter courses or in a low maintenance dose after a shorter high dose treatment. However, consider the side effects of the cortisone and adjust the dose to the expected survival At the late palliative stage, the importance of nutrition treatment as the body cannot absorb food and fluid in the same way and it is expected that the patient will eat less.

However, 6 months intervals have been used in Sweden for a long time in follow-up after both resection and transplantation as well as in primary HCC monitoring. Given the increased risk of early local relapses, more frequent follow-up has been advocated for the first year after ablation. Since intrahepatic relapses are most common after ablation/resection [374] in combination with the fact that in principle only these can be treated curatively, it justifies follow-up with a focus on the liver alone. For ablation and resection patients with persistent underlying liver disease, long-term application of the same criteria for post-intervention follow-up as for primary HCC monitoring. Proponents of more intensive post-LTx follow-up have described that such may provide an increased chance of curative targeted treatment of HCC relapse after LTx [455).

Acute intermittent porphyria leads to an increased risk of developing HCC without other underlying liver disease. • Hepatitis B and C risk groups should be screened • Hepatitis B vaccination should be offered to risk groups. • Hepatitis B prophylaxis should be given to newborns whose mothers have hepatitis B. • Treatment of chronic hepatitis B should offer patients with high liver disease.",
