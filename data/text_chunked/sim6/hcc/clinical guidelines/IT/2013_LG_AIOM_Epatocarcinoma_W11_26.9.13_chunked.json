Other causes are alcohol abuse, certain hereditary metabolic diseases (haemochromatosis and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency), and the metabolic syndrome represented by obesity, diabetes and hepatic steatosis. Cirrhosis is the main risk factor for HCH, while co-risk factors for the development of HCH on cirrhoses are: co-infection of HBV and HCV viruses, hepatitis B virus genotype C and C1b genotype, and consistently elevated and significantly repeated HCV transaminase values (about 5 times higher than normal values), while single infection with HBV produces about 80+ active HCV values and carries a relative risk of developing HCV infection. The effect of antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B on the prevention of the development of HCC is controversial, while the risk for HCC in HCV-infected patients treated with interferon and ribavirin who achieve a prolonged viral response is reduced compared to untreated or non-responsive patients. However, it is unclear whether this reduction is achieved even when liver cirrhosis is already present. LHCC is one of the most well-defined neoplasms and therefore, at least theoretically, preventable. Furthermore, epidemiological data clearly show that a population of at-risk subjects, i.e. patients with cirrhosis of the liver and certain categories of patients with chronic viral hepatitis, is well identifiable. Due to improvements in the management of complications of cirrhotic liver disease, in particular those related to portal hypertension, HCC has recently become the most likely cause of death in patients with compensated stage of liver disease.",

For these patients, liver transplantation should also be considered immediately. If they are not transplantable, they may be susceptible to other therapies, but the choice must be very careful, individualized and absolutely managed within a multidisciplinary team, because of the risk of precipitating irreversible liver failure. Since cancer treatments for HCC can cause changes, at least temporary, in portal pressure, every patient with HCC on cirrhosis should undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) for signs of portal hypertension and for the gradation of bleeding risk from varicose veins, before the start of oncological therapy.

In fact the TNm is also based on histological data, such as nodal microscopic invasion, and is encoded after the surgical removal of the primary tumor. These data are almost never available for HCC in cirrhotics as the surgery approach is viable only in a minority of cases and does not involve lymphadenectomy due to the risk of ascitic decompensation. Therefore, morphological staging is approached almost exclusively on the basis of imaging techniques. In addition, it is also necessary to consider the degree of underlying hepatic function both for the purposes of treatment and prognostic purposes. For many reasons such staging systems have been proposed. For these reasons, numerous staging systems have been proposed.

In cirrhotic patients with HCC limited to the liver and with good residual liver function, treatment should aim, where possible, at the eradication of the neoplasm. A first consideration should be whether the patient is eligible for a liver transplant as this procedure represents a cure for both HCC and the underlying cirrhosis. However, in practice, liver transplantation is applicable to a very small fraction of cirrotic HCC patients due to clinical and oncological limitations associated with organisational and social considerations. Therefore, given the limited availability of organs, the use of transplantation must be based on the concept of equity between the different categories of patients and cannot disregard the calculation of the benefit of survival provided to the individual patient with transplantation compared to the expected results with other possible anticancer treatments The best survival results (75-80% at 5 years) after liver transplantation for HCC on hepatic cirrhosis are in patients who meet the Milan criteria, i.e. a single neoplasm ≤ 5 cm or multiples of no more than 3 nodes and diameter ≤ 326 cm (Level 2++).",

Similarly, down-staging of tumors exceeding the Milano criteria in order to bring them back to the transplantation criteria has been proposed by several groups32, 33 (level of evidence 3). beyond the Milan criteria (in order to bring them within the scope of transplantability) is not yet fully defined due to the lack of good quality clinical studies. The transplantation of the right hepatic lobe from a living donor represents a controversial indication for liver transplantation for HCC, especially in view of a percentage, albeit low, of deaths (1 case per 200-500 procedures of donation of right liver lobe) and a significant incidence of serious complications and permanent disability among donors34, 35 (Level of evidence 2-). In Europe, unlike in Asia and Japan, the transplantation from a live donor is rarely performed and represents only 0.6% of all liver transplants for hCC36. In the case of a surgical patient with HCC in Milan that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in the treatment of liver cancer due to liver disease, the selection of alternative therapeutic approaches for liver surgery is not feasible because of the age of the patient.

Two randomised trials evaluated radiofrequency percutaneous ablation versus surgical resection42,43. The first of the two, which randomised 180 patients, with tumours ≤ 5 cm, to receive either RFA or surgery resection, failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the two approaches42 (Level of Evidence 1-) in the survival rate at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years.

For these patients there is no evidence of benefit from the application of systemic treatments. Several studies suggest that combined treatments (TACE + percutaneous ablation) increase tumour response to locoregional therapy, extending the volume of tumour necrosis achievable. The meta-analysis of four small randomised trials comparing single and combined treatment showed a survival advantage with the use of combined therapies61 (Level of evidence 1+). The combined approach allows maximum flexibility in the treatment and retraction of each individual nodule, or in the event of the appearance of a new lesion.",

A recent Cochrane systematic review concluded that there is no clear evidence of efficacy for any adjuvent approach.62 (Level of evidence 1+). Some meta-analyses have instead confirmed a survival benefit obtainable with antiviral therapy in viral patients, due to its favorable effect on disease progression and mortality not related to HCC (L63 (L1+) evidence). Patients undergoing surgical or percutaneous ablative treatment who have shown a complete response are recommended to undergo a low-contrast positive imaging method every three months for the first two years and every six months thereafter. Advanced HCC is characterized by the presence of portal vein thrombosis and/or metastasis. In these cases there is no indication for locoregional treatments as it is a systemic disease. Some highly specialized surgical centers have proposed and perform portal thrombectomy associated with hepatic resection of HCC, especially in cases where the portal invasion is limited to the branches of order II and III. However, there are no data indicating that this procedure is superior or equivalent to treatment with sorafenib.",

The most commonly reported adverse events are skin toxicity (HFSR, hand-foot skin reaction), diarrhoea, asthenia. Hypertension may occur, but appears to be less frequent in patients with HCC than in patients receiving sorafenib for renal cancer. Asthenia may occur in HCC patients independently of treatment with Sorafenib and is potentially related to the underlying hepatopathy. The occurrence of side effects (particularly HFSR and severe reactions) during treatment with Serafenib can be managed by temporary discontinuation of treatment and/ or dose reductions, depending on the severity of the observed toxicity. Dose reductions may be based on halving the daily dose (200 mg twice daily instead of 400 mg twice a day), and the dose may be further reduced by one level (200 mg two times daily on alternate days): Full dose 400 mg every other day First reduction 200 mg once a day Second reduction 100 mg once daily every other 2 days Table 6 summarises the dose reductions and treatment interruptions based on the observed toxicity during treatment with sorafenib adopted in the SHARP",

Recommendation Strength Clinical recommendation SIGN clinical recommendations In patients with HCC, treatment with tamoxifen or strong androgenic anti-A negatives should not be undertaken. The use of chemotherapeutic agents in HCC patients, characterised by a high rate of marked impairment of more or less potent hepatic function, results in increased carcinogenicity associated with elevated risk of cancer, in addition to the intrinsically low toxicity of HCC-related carcinogens. In addition, HCC can be listed among cancers intrinsically characterized by less chemo-sensitivity. Numerous chemotherapeutic drugs, as single agents or in combination, have been experimented over the past decades in patients with HCC, producing more or less disappointing percentages of objective responses, without ever producing a solid demonstration of efficacy. Among the various cytotoxic drugs experimented and variously used in clinical practice, doxorubicin, used as a single agent, is reported.",

It should be noted that the study population has different characteristics from Western patients with HCC: over 90% of the randomized patients had HCC related to hepatitis B virus infection while just over half of the patients were cirrhotic and of the latter 89% had good liver function (Child-Pugh). These results cannot be extrapolated to Western patients who are largely affected by hepatic cirrhosis and generally have worse liver function than the patients in the study. In addition to highlighting the diversity - in terms of disease characteristics and prognosis - of Asian patients compared to Western patients, it should be recalled above all that the study in question adopted a control arm (doxorubicin) which, at present, is not the standard and cannot be considered an adequate control for these patients.",
