The\n- ii - In accordance with §35a Social Code Book (SBG) V, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) commissioned the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) to assess the\nbenefit of the drug lenvatinib. The assessment is based on a dossier compiled by the\npharmaceutical company (hereinafter referred to as the “company”). The dossier was sent to\nIQWiG on 19 September 2018. The aim of this report is to assess the added benefit of lenvatinib in comparison with the appropriate comparator therapy (ACT) in adult patients with advanced or inoperable\nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received prior systemic therapy. In the therapeutic indication of lenvatinib, the G-BA differentiated between 2 patient populations and specified different ACTs for them. For the benefit assessment of lenvatinib,\nthis results in 2 research questions, which are presented in Table 2.",

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were used for\nderiving an added benefit. Research question 1: patients with Child-Pugh A or no hepatic cirrhosis\nDescription of the included study 304\nThe REFLECT study (E7080-G000-304, short name 304) was used for the benefit assessment of lenvatinib in comparison with sorafenib in the treatment of adults with HCC and Child-Pugh\nA or without hepatic cirrhosis. The 304 study is an open-label RCT comparing lenvatinib with sorafenib. The study included\nadults with HCC in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B or C who did not receive any prior systemic therapy for the advanced or inoperable disease. Hepatic cirrhosis of any\naetiology was not an exclusion criterion. Patients in BCLC stage B had to be ineligible for\ntransarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Further inclusion criteria were Child-Pugh stage A\nand an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group – Performance Status (ECOG-PS) score of 0 or 1. Overall, 478 patients were placed in the lenvatinib arm and 476 in the sorafenib arm of the study. Randomization was stratified by the criteria of region (Asia-Pacific/Western regions),\nECOG-PS (0/1), body weight (<60 kg/≥60 kg) and the presence of macroscopic portal vein invasion (MPVI) and/or extrahepatic spread (ES) (yes/no). The 304 study had a total of 3 study phases: a pre-randomization phase, a randomization phase\nconsisting of a treatment phase and a follow-up phase, and an analogously designed extension phase.",

In both study arms, the treatment and any dose adjustments\nwere performed in accordance with the current Summary of Product Characteristics [SPC]. The randomization phase was followed by an extension phase, in which patients either continued to receive the study medication in accordance with the original allocation or were\nfollowed up if treatment was discontinued during the randomization phase. In terms of their\ndesign, there was no technical difference between the randomization and extension phases. The\nextension phase is still ongoing.

It is also assumed that patients in BCLC stage D are ineligible for lenvatinib treatment. b: Presentation of the respective ACT specified by the G-BA. c: BSC is considered the therapy that ensures the best possible, individually optimized supportive care to alleviate symptoms and improve the quality of life. d: Only patients with an ECOG-PS of 0 or 1 were included in the study.
