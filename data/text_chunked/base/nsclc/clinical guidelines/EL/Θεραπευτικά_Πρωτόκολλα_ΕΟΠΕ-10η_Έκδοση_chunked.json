The most common EGFR mutations are exon 19 deletions (45% of cases) and the L858R spot mutation on exon 21 (40% of cases). These mutations have been associated with susceptibility to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKs) and are referred to as susceptible mutations. Randomised phase III studies showed that CI inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib) have an advantage over chemotherapy (in terms of objective response rates, disease-free survival and improved quality of life) in untreated patients with EGFR mutations and a general status score of 0-2. Furthermore, pre-designed analyses of these studies separately also showed a significant benefit in overall survival for patients clearing",

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) accounts for approximately 80% of all non-melanocytic skin cancers.[1] BCCs generally develop slowly, and initially develop locally in extensive areas of soft tissue, cartilage, and bone.[24] BCC is classified as aggressive and non-aggressive, with aggressive neoplasms accounting for 5-20% of all BCC cases.[25][26] The incidence of advanced disease is estimated at 1%.[27] Advanced BCC includes",

The efficacy of Vismodegib as a small molecule inhibitor of SMO was tested in patients with locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma for which surgical treatment is no longer feasible, evaluated in the Phase II ERIVANCE study. A total of 119 patients with advanced BCC were included in the efficacy analysis of Study 1620, 84 patients with laBCC and 35 patients with mBCC, with objective response rate (ORR) as the primary endpoint and without requiring testing for PD-L1 prior to initiation of cemiplimab [11].",
