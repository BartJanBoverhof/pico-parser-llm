The scope of these results is, however, limited by the following: ‒ Despite statistical significance, the one-time estimate of the absolute difference in progression-free survival is small, and the clinical relevance of this difference is questionable; ‒ The open-label design of the study, which led to possible evaluation pathways, including treatment decision evaluation, with a marked increase in the docetaxel group of pre-progression treatment changes compared to the docétaxel group (31 patients; versus 24) ‒ A contradiction in the results of the interdiagnostic analysis of unreported progression in the reproducibility of this objective measure; In this context, the overall prognostic effect is poor, and clinical significance of the difference is debatable; LUMKRAS (LUMKRS) with a negative impact on the quality of life, especially in the short-term context of reassessment of treatment decisions, with notably increased incidence of treatment changes before progression as compared to docetaxil (31; versus 24). It should also be noted that exposure to 25% of the dose tested in this trial produces the same area under the plasma curve.",
