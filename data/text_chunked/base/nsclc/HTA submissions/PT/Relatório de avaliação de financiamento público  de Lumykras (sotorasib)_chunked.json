It is currently the only inhibitor of Kras G12c approved by the European Medicines Agency, at a dosage of 960 mg/day PO, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. As the biology of lung cancer has become known, new drugs have been developed that act on specific components of the cancer. These drugs are called biologic or targeted therapeutics. These mutations initiate the oncogenic process and activate signaling pathways that the tumour needs to survive. Blocking this signaling can induce apoptosis and tumour regression. This is the framework for the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced CPNPC with mutated KRAS G12C, oral therapeutics and with the possibility of sequential use after chemotherapy or immunotherapy. In case of progression, the second line of treatment for advanced cPNPC consists of docetaxel monotherapy, or with pemetrex or docetaxil + nitendanib combination, or PD-L1 inhibitors such as nivolumab, pembrozolizumab or pentotubes, followed by discontinuous tubulination of the tubule, which reduces the activity of docopib, and a decrease in its activity of an anti-tubulin agent, which is a reducing agent in the circulatory system.

However, only recently, it has been possible to robustly evaluate the prevalence of the p.G12C mutation in patients with CPNCP. To do this, data from the AACR GENIE registry, an international registry with information from 19 of the main cancer treatment centers in the world, is required. In this Lumykras (Sasibotor) registry there were a total 13,243 patients with cPNCP, of which 29.0% (n=3838) had a KRAS mutation and 12.01% (n = 16.04), specifically had the PPNPC mutation. it is possible to conclude that, of the 4,603 cases of CPNPC diagnosed annually, 557 (12,1%) will be KRAS p.G12C positive.",

TAIM submitted a phase 1-2 clinical trial, an indirect comparison analysis by MAIC, and interim data from a phase 3 controlled clinical study. Overall quality of evidence was classified as moderate, as a consequence of the immaturity of overall survival outcomes. Moderate quality means moderate certainty of outcome (meaning: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimated effect, but there is a possibility that it may be substantially different).",
