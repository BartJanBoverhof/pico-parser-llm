Survival for the whole group has improved during the period that we have had national care programmes in Sweden, probably thanks to an increased proportion of active treatment. After curative treatment (ablation, resection or transplantation), the median 5-year survival is 4075%, while the relatively large group of HCC patients with advanced tumour onset, poor liver function or impaired general condition, who can only be offered symptomatic treatment, have a median survival of less than 1 year. Which treatment is chosen depends mainly on tumour factors and organism function, but some varies in different parts of the country. Our care programme aims to contribute equally to the care of certain groups at risk of developing HCC, which may therefore be recommended depending on the region. The diagnosis of HCC is made in most cases with non-invasive radiological criteria, which however presuppose underlying cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B.",

In the first line, combination therapy including immunotherapy is now recommended, but also tyrosine kinase inhibitors, with a little bit of other side effect profile, is widely used.

Therefore, AFP can be considered as complementary to ultrasounds when treating the underlying viral inflammation in hepatitis [93, 94].

Cirrhotia is by its nature a histological diagnosis, therefore liver biopsy has been considered the gold standard. A newer, non-invasive technique for assessing the severity of chronic liver disease is transient vibration controlled elastography (VCTE). Elastography has a very high sensitivity for cirrhic liver disease but poorer specificity, which means that advanced leukaemia can be ruled out. Using elastography as the only test to diagnose cirrhiosis should be delivered with caution, at least two measurements and quality evaluations of the liver, so in cases of good prognosis, the basis for the diagnosis should be established and the patient should be medically valid (< 30%). The limit value between advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis for elastography value varies in different studies and is now usually recommended a limit value of about 15 kPa [107, 108].",

None of the studies reviewed have specifically examined HCC screening in a Swedish context. The more recent studies examining the cost-efficiency of semi-annual ultrasound and AFP screening combined with AFP show slightly different results. A 2019 Canadian study shows that the cost per quality-adjusted life year is approximately SEK 770 000 when ultrasound is compared to no monitoring for patients with grade F3/F4 who have undergone successful treatment for hepatitis C and have an annual HCC incidence of significantly less than 0.5% [154]. The corresponding result for patients suffering from cirrhosis of the liver and a yearly HCC incident of 1.39% is about SEK 385 000 [154] A US study from 2022 also examines patients with successful hepatitis C treatment and quality of life adjusted by quality of monitoring is approximately 960 000 SEK per year.",

A disadvantage of the standard method RECIST in HCC is that there are effective treatments, such as some locoregional modalities and targeted drugs, that do not affect the size of tumors and where the clinical effect of treatment is therefore not captured [175]. The problem of the absence of tumor shrinkage was addressed with the introduction of the concept of viabletumor in the modified RECISTM criteria (mRECIST) [176]. Tumor viability is defined radiologically as the remaining contrast-suppressing area in the tumor I. Instead of measuring the maximum length of the tumor according to the MRCIST 1.1 method, the maximum diameter of the longest diametrical remaining area (MRCIST) or the maximum time remaining in the intermediate stage (TACRISTM) in the region after complete non-absorption or contraception of the HCC (T) is measured by TACRIST 1. However, several studies have shown that response (=ORR, overall response rate) after locoregional treatment as measured by mRECIST predicts survival (OS) [177].",

The risk of developing PFLF depends on factors related to the patient, the liver and the surgical technique. In liver surgery, generically the volume of remaining after surgery (future liver remnant, FLR) is of high potassium, but in HCC and underlying liver parenchymal function, predictive methods are often not available to assess the risk for developing severe liver dysfunction (e.g., PHLP) such as a small-scale liver transplantation. Child-Pugh scale, MELD, etc., are not developed (or calibrated) to predict the risk of PHLF.",

The recommendations in this section are a simplification of these guidelines. Preoperative FLR calculation using DRT or MRT provides an insight into the risk for PFLF in a liver function which, according to the European Consensus Document, is described as normal at 20% of FLRF, while the Swedish FHLF standard uses at least 30% of normal liver function (<20%), whilst FLR uses a sufficiently low risk for FHL.

Assessment of liver function should always be performed when planning a large or complex liver resection or when suspected liver failure, such as advanced chronic liver disease or drug-induced liver injury, see Figure 3 Preoperative assessment with respect to planned resection and progressive liver function. Several methods exist to assess liver function, but there is no evidence to recommend a specific method for assessing liver function in the face of surgery, and local expertise is often lacking in assessing the risk factors of liver failure and kidney failure. The prevalence of liver cirrhosis related to metabolic risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity is increasing significantly in the community and should be considered in the preoperative risk assessment.

Elastography provides a good estimate of the degree of fibrosis (and steatosis) and has in practice replaced the need for preoperative liver biopsy, except in special cases. Different studies show varying thresholds for increased risk of PHLF (4.3-14 kPa), which complicates the practical application. ICG clearance is a commonly used method to measure liver function and high values are associated with increased risk for PFLF. There are several promising new methods under development, such as LIMAX, hepatic and functional MRI, but insufficient evidence to recommend them generically. Overall, this method should always be performed in the presence of large volumes (three or more segments) or complex (domestic-anatomical) abnormalities, even if no specific diagnosis of chronic liver dysfunction can be recommended. If chronic liver disease is suspected, the investigation should be supplemented by extended liver function assessment, although no specific method for this can be recommended. It is important to note that the risk of chronic hepatic disease/cirrhosis is high even if the patient has not yet been diagnosed. Approximately 80% of HCC in Sweden occurs in a cirrhotic liver, and HCC is often the first complication of cirrhosus, which is therefore not uncommonly undiagnosed upon detection [205]. Figure 3.",

However, less than 40% of the HCC can be subclassified into these sub-types.

However, international consensus on the definition of R1 for HCC resections is lacking [220], which is why the minimum distance from the tumour to the hepatic transcervical cell site and any other residual tissue with a margin of < 1mm [221-223] should be specified. the minimum distance from tumor cells to the hepatic transsection surface and possibly other resection edges with < 1 mm margin should be indicated [221-223].",

Because underlying liver disease, with and without cirrhosis, is so common in HCC, not only the volume but the function of the central FLR is important [260]. For liver-refreshed patients, at least 30% FLR use is considered adequate, while a larger margin is recommended for underlying hepatic disease. In addition, the underlying kidney disease may result in both decreased growth rate and total growth [261]. Volymexpansion may be performed with PVE (ventricular embolism), ALP (associating portal vein liver partition and astigmatism), SVET for hepatic ligation, and double vein embolisation (SVEP+H). In a systematic meta-analysis, ALPPS resulted in faster growth, higher resection rate, shorter time to tumour-free but also a significantly higher rate of complications compared to PVE and SIRT [262].",

Via the catheter, cytostatics (usually doxorubicin) or radioactive microspheres (yttrium) can be deposited directly into the tumour. Two retrospective studies show better survival [293] and a higher rate of tumor necrosis [294] with selective cytostatic administration (i.e. in segmental or subsegmental arteries) than with lobar. Cytostatic infusion is often terminated by embolisation with spongostan [295] or degradable [296] or permanent particulate embolism [297]; Intracytoplasmic embolistic infusion often terminates without transcytoplasty infusion (TAI), whereas intracytopathic embolist infusion terminates with transcellular embolisation (TAE) [295].

Macro-vascular spread in HCC, sometimes loosely referred to as tumor thrombos, is also a frequent phenomenon. There has been some hesitancy in treating portal thromboembolic syndrome with cirrhotic syndrome. Elevated INR and thrombocytopenia have led to a perception that patients with circrosis would be naturally anticoagulated. There was also a concern that anti-coagulant therapy would provoke bleeding events, partly spontaneous, and partly associated with portal hypertension. However, it is not self-evident to always initiate anticoagulation in newly diagnosed port thrombosis. Several factors influence the decision. In planned liver transplantation it is important to maintain the portomenterial confluence of thromboses, where even a minor thrombus should lead to initiation of anti coagulation. Broken thromboses that involve the entire nucleus and extend to the mesenteric vessels also increase the indication of treatment, as well as any symptoms related to DOAC, such as more severe thrombotic events or signs of paralysis.",

For ablation and resection patients with remaining long-term renal disease, the same criteria for careful follow up as those for primary observation of HCC have been applied in Sweden. Prior to such intensive monitoring, LTX could be used to describe an increased likelihood of occurrence of LTX after treatment.
