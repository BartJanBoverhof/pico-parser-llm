The following major changes arise for hepatocellulose cancer to the 2022 S3 Guideline: • Imaging diagnostics (Chapter 3.3): CEUS is recommended for imaging diagnosis in addition to MRI, while MRI should continue to be used for local spread diagnostics. • Radiation therapy (chapter 3.4.3): As part of this update, a systematic review of radiation therapy was conducted with two evidence-based recommendations that SBRT should be considered for treatment of tumours confined to the liver as a bridging procedure or when other local procedures are not feasible. • Treatment should be evaluated as a combination of systemic therapy and long-term therapy.",

On the basis of this systematic research, no recommendation could be made due to the lack of available studies. o The recommendation for first-line therapy of gemcitabine/ cisplatin has been extended to include the combination with durvalumab. o Progress under first line therapy is recommended by presentation in the Molecular Tumor Board. o In second lines, more treatment options based on molecular changes are available: no oncology programme. o Hepatocellular carcinoma and biliary carcinomas. o Long-term survival. o August 4.0 ▪ Patients with microsatellite instability or mitochondrial repair insufficiency with progestogen inhibitor have been recommended as preclinical therapy in the preparation of immunotherapy (progress) with pemibrolizumab in patients with progressive renal failure. (FGFR2) fusion or an FGFR rearrangement has been recommended as second-line therapy in cholangiocarcinoma.",

These high-quality guidelines can not only serve the structured design of the knowledge system, but also find their place in the structure of the health system. Because these high-quality guidelines are not only used for structured knowledge transfer, but can also be used in the design of health system structures, such as evidence-based guidelines as a basis for creating and updating disease management programmes or the use of quality indicators extracted from guidelines in the context of the certification of organ tumour centres.

The guideline was developed in editorial independence from the funding organisation. All members submitted a written declaration of any existing conflicts of interest during the guidelines process using the AWMF form (initially, updated before the Consensus Conference).

Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer worldwide. According to current GLOBOCAN data, more than 905 000 people worldwide fell ill with a primary liver tumor (HCK and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) in 2020 and more than 830 000 died from it [http:\\\\gco.iarc.fr]. The most common risk factors for HCC in Germany are currently chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and alcohol consumption. The incidence of HCC has increased significantly in the Western world due to chronic HCV infection-related cirrhosis of the liver as well as the significant increase in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Hepatitis (NASH) with advanced fibrosis or cirrosis. Cohort studies have shown that approximately 1-8% of all patients with cirrhosis develop HCC (2% for HBV, 3-8% for HCV) [3], [4], [5] whereas in NAFLD or NASH the incidence of HCC varies greatly (0.004 - 7.6%) [6]. In NAFLD or NASH, on the other hand, the incidence of HCC varies greatly (0.004 - 7.6%) [6],[7].",

These patients should be offered regular early diagnosis from a PAGE score of 10 onwards. Antiviral therapy reduces the risk. Using the PAGE-B score allows for risk stratification.[11] An antiviral therapy in chronic HBV with a nucleoside/nucleotide analogue reduces both the risk of progression of liver cirrhosis including hepatic decompensation and the HCC risk.[2] However, these patients sometimes have a significantly increased risk of HCC compared to the general clinical population despite antiviral treatment.[12] For Asian patients, therefore, various risk assessment systems have been published, such as GAG-HCC, CU-Hcc or RE-B-Score, [13] [14], [15], For Caucasian patients with chronic hepatitis B, the PAGAE assessment system has been established [11]. For Caucasian patients with chronic HBV, the PAGE-B rating system was established [11] to calculate a score based on the following: • Age (16-29 years: 0 points; 30-39 years:2 points; 40-49 years:4 points; 50-59 years:6 points; 60-69 years:8 points and ≥ 70 years:10 points); • Gender (female: 0 point; male: 6 points); and • Thrombocyte counts (≥ 200/ dl: 0 marks; 100-199/ dl: 6 marks; < 100/ dl:9 marks) For practical reasons, the presence of liver cirrhosis was not included in the rating system.",

Patients with NASH and cirrhosis of the liver have an increased risk for HCC, whereas the risk of hCC in NASH without cirrhotic disease is variable. Several recent publications have shown that some of the patients with Nash and HCC do not have cirrosis [6],[18] but these are usually retrospective cohort studies. We would like to refer here to the S2k guideline \"Proving non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\" published in April 2022. Consensus-based recommendation continued in 2023 with patients with advanced liver failure, regardless of the cause of the initial diagnosis, who may be eligible to participate in a HCC trial. Liver fibrosis, irrespective of the cause of the liver disease, may be offered participation in an HCC early detection. Strong consensus Chronic liver diseases under various causes can lead to fibrosation of liver tissue up to liver cirrhosis. The determination of the fibrose stage is classically histopathological using various classification systems that are often disease-specific, such as the METAVIR score, according to Desmet and Scheuer, Knodell or Ishak [19]. The histopathological classification of the fibrous stage based on a liver biopsy is increasingly abandoned due to its invasiveness, low acceptability, cost, but also because of a potential sampling error due to inhomogeneous fibrotic transformation. © L 1 Risk cofactoring, prevention and early detection 36 The incidence of HCC in NAFLD patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis is 1.25 per 1000 person-years for all NAFLd patients, and 14.46 per 1000 persons-year for NASFLD with advanced fibroblasts and cirrhotic disease [20].",

These data support the current HCC surveillance failures of the NAFLD. For the identification of patients with history of fibrosis, there are no procedures available besides the FIB scores and risk categories. Since the global prevalence of NAFLD is approximately 25% and continues to increase, these data support prevention and early detection of cancer beyond the liver in adults with NAFLd. For the non-invasive determination of liver rigidity as a surrogate marker of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, various elastographic methods are therefore available today, such as transient hepatic elastography (Fibroscan®), scleral wave elastography Acoustic Force Pulsed Radiography (ARFI) and MR-Blast Impulse Elastography (EIB) [22], which is often used as a blood test for liver disease.",

In Taiwan, the introduction from the 1980s onwards of HBV vaccination programs has reduced the rate of new HBV infections in children from 86-96% to 12-14% (HBeAg-positive mothers) and from 10-12% to 3-4% (HBEAg-negative mothers). As a result, the incidence of HCC has significantly decreased, especially among male adolescents [47], [48].",

However, the presentation of a HCC is a significant part of the cases for various challenging reasons, so that the definitive diagnosis requires additional molecular testing and pathological examinations. In contrast to other malignancies or mixed hepatic carcinomas (combined HCC/ CCA), immunohistological representation of hepatocellular linear differentiation or lineal differentiation of suspected differential diagnoses may be helpful. Hepatocyte markers are currently recommended as HepPar1 and Arginase 1, whose expression patterns are inconsistent and whose combined use may be of little benefit in increasing sensitivity (see biliary linear markers).

The fall of a previously elevated AFP value to < 500ng/ml is associated with a favourable prognosis, so that a transplantation appears to be meaningful at that time. Thus, in an evaluation of the UN-DOS database, the HCCR rate was 35.0% for AFP values > 1000 ng/ ml for transplantation. However, if patients are over 65 years of age, the indication for liver transplantation should be examined particularly carefully. More strongly, chronological age does not constitute a contraindication for a liver transplant [177], [178], biological age being the decisive factor. Chronological age per se does not constitute a contraindication for liver transplantation [177], [178], biological age is more decisive.

      "text": "Strong consensus Patients on the waiting list are at a relevant risk of tumour progression. The primary objective of bridging therapy is to prevent tumour progress and associated withdrawal from the wait list in patients on the liver transplantation waiting list. Within the Milan criteria, the risk of tumor progression is dependent on different factors such as size, number and degree of differentiation of the tumour. These should be taken into account when deciding whether or not to use bridge therapy and weighed against the potential peri-interventional risk. This is especially true in patients with limited liver function and small tumours. In contrast, for stage BCLC-A, there are now many retrospective evaluations of large multi-centre and national collectives and corresponding meta-analyses. The study situation shows divergent results regarding the benefit of a bridging therapy for patients with HCC in the group within the Milan criteria. The therapeutic success of neoadjuvant therapies is mainly dependent on the response (responder vs. non-responder). Several studies [190], [191], [192], [193], [194], [195], [196], demonstrate better survival rates after transplantation with good response to therapy or worse survivorship rates with therapy. In addition, most studies provide evidence that a (heronegional) bridge therapy significantly reduces the risk of tumour progression and thus significantly decreases the rate of tumor progression. Bridging therapy delays tumour progression and thereby significantly reduces the risk of drop-out from the waiting list. For example, a recent meta-analysis showed a relative risk of HCC-related drop-off from the transplantation waiting list when using locoregional bridging therapy of 0.11 (95% CI: 0.07; 0.17) [187]. However, this value was not statistically significant when the studies were highly heterogeneous. A multicentre, statistical evaluation of the data of 1083 European HCC patients within the Milan criteria using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis showed that in an intention to treat (ITT) consideration of a low risk for HCC related drop-outs from the wait list due to a bridge therapy by 34 to 49% [197]. In addition, response to bridging therapy similar to downstaging (see below) within the Milan criteria can be used as a tumor biology selection criterion, thus contributing to better patient selection and lower recurrence rate [198].An evaluation of UNOS data from over 3000 HCC patients within the Milano criteria (compared with and without bridged therapy) found a significantly lower proportion of microvascular (16.8% vs.",

In addition, it has been shown that a high number of treatments is necessary for an aggressive tumor biology, especially if an increasing AFP value is found at the same time. Both are accompanied by an increased recurrence rate [153], [161], [199], [200], [201], [202], [203], even if the HCC is still within the low Milan criteria in terms of image morphology.

Therefore, in addition to the radiological response, the AFP value is also important in assessing the risk of relapse. e.g. it has been shown that with a normal AFP value (either pre-initial or under bridging therapy < 20 ng/ml) the lowest risk of recurrence is after LTx (5-year recurrence rate of about 7%) However, there is no normalisation of the AFP decrease compared to locoregional therapy.

For example, it has been shown that the risk of tumour recurrence after transplantation can be classified into three categories based on the combination of the initial AFP value and PET-positivity alone, regardless of the tumour size and tumour density.

However, at present, only smaller studies or combination studies are available that do not provide an evidence-based recommendation for downstage via systems therapy [218], [219], [220]. 3.4 Operative and interventional therapies 73 There is currently no evidence-based basis for adjuvant tumour therapy, so it should not be used outside of studies [222], see also Systemic Therapy chapter 3.5.8.

In addition to mTOR inhibitors, these include antimetabolites (mycophenolate, azathioprine) and low interleukin-2 receptor antagonists [227]. For the use of mTor inhibitors in combination with CNI in high postoperative levels [228], the best available evidence so far is in the form of a prospective dose reduction study of the MIC [229]. In the prospective randomised SiLVER study, 500 HCC patients within and outside the Milan criteria were treated with either mTOR-free immunosuppression or with a combination of sirolimus and CNI.

Conventional Lipiodol-TACE and Drug-eluting Beadogen TACE can be used as approximately equivalent procedures depending on the individual risk profile and preferences of the treatment (see Appendix). Therefore, a preference for this treatment technique can be considered in patients who are at particular risk in this regard. To date, no evidence has been provided that drug-eluting bead TACE improves the survival prognosis of patients compared to conventional TACE. 3.4 Operative and interventional therapeutic procedures 84 For TACE, anthracyclines (doxorubicin, epirubicin) or platinum derivatives should be used [300]. The use of mitomycin C is also possible. A cumulative dose of 450 mg/m2 should not be exceeded when using doxorubacin due to cardiotoxic side effects. Single embolisms cannot be recommended in general, but they are also effective.",

Since TACE is normally indicated in patients with multiple and/ or large tumour centres in stage B BCLC, it may need to be repeated to achieve complete devascularisation of all tumour clusters. The aim is to achieve full devascularization of all tumor centres while largely preserving the non-affected hepatic parenchyma. This requires numerous selective and super-selective catheterizations using microcatheters and sometimes complex intra-procedural diagnostics. The amounts of emboli and cytostats applied in a therapy session are limited to avoid adverse reactions and limit complications. In particular, no more than 10 to 15 ml should be administered in a post-intervention course within 4 weeks of TACE administration. A post-interventional follow-up should be performed within 4-12 weeks after TACE, requiring adequate residual treatment with contrast-enhanced biphasic arterial and portal venous contrast CT or MRI followed by mRECIST-compliant assessment of remission. Therapeutic options should be re-evaluated in an interdisciplinary tumour conference in the following situations: • regularly after 2 TACE; • increasing obliteration of tumour-supplying arterial vessels, resulting in a lack of arterial access to the tumour; • reaching a cumulative dose of 450 mg/ m2 doxorubicin; • the occurrence of contraindications, such as significant deterioration of liver function, extrahepatic metastasis, tumour invasion of large portal or hepatic veins, worsening of the general condition of patients with tumour related symptoms (OG/ EC = 2).",

Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 90 and 257 days, respectively. A comparison of different modalities of radiotherapy administration in patients with portal vein thrombosis was performed in a meta-analysis of 2513 patients, which showed that the different radiotherapies did not differ statistically significantly from each other in the pooled 1-year overlap: 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) 43.8%, TARE 46.5% and stereotactic radiotherapeutic therapy (SBRT) 48.5% [318]. Additional literature Annex S (Table 26: Literature overview on TARE) In addition to the TARE-TACE comparisons, there were several studies comparing TARE and sorafenib. The SARAH study compared 237 patients with TARE versus 222 patients with Sorafenib [32a]. The difference in median overall survival was not statistically significant at 8.0 months in the TARE arm versus 9.9 months for the sorafenib arm. The number of patients with at least one treatment-associated adverse reaction ≥ grade 3 was lower in the ART arm at 41% versus the soravenib arm at 63%. A quality of life analysis using the ETC OR QLQ-C30 questionnaire found a significantly better outcome for the overall health status for the ART arms. The time to progression of tumour disease in the liver was significantly longer for the TARE, but this was not associated with an increase in overall survival. In the Asia-Pacific region, tren has been studied in a total of 360 patients.

LI-RadS summarizes the relevant CT and MRI markers primarily for diagnosis, but is not validated for assessment following interventional therapies [349], [350]. To date, this system has also been adopted in Germany for the non-flattening outcome of diagnosis. In addition to the morphological evaluation of the treated intrahepatic lesion and thus the effectiveness of the local ablative therapy procedure, imaging serves the detection of post-intervention complications and in the further course also the re-local intra- and extrahepatic staging [352].

A detailed characterization of 133 cHCC-CCAs from the Asian region was able to show the heterogeneity of this group of tumors [432]. The molecular patterns there showed for some of the changes commonly seen in HCC tumors in this study, other patterns typical for tumors that are commonly observed in C.B.C.A. have been shown to occur in 6.5% of the cases of FGCA and FFRH respectively, and both mutations are found to be raptorial [431]. Data for systemic therapy are limited to retrospective analyses and date from 1999 to 2020. The comparability of the characterisation of these rare tumours remains unclear, as the diagnostic criteria have evolved continuously over this long period. With these limitations, the tendency for a platinum-containing systemic treatment to work can be inferred from the retroactive data, for tyrosine kinase inhibitors there are conflicting observations. A retrospect analysis from France for the years 2009 to 2020 compared 25 patients treated with KTIs with 54 patients receiving platinum based therapy. In a further retrospective analysis from Korea from 1999 to 2015, 62 patients on sorafenib and 37 patients on systemic therapy were treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy [434].

The presence of preoperative nutrition deficiency in patients with hepatic resection with HCC has been associated with elevated post-operative complications and prolonged hospital stay [441], and GLIM criteria should be used to diagnose poor nutrition [452]. Malnutrition should be diagnosed using the GLIM Criteria [452]. The current ESPEN guideline Clinical nutrition in liver disease recommends the Nutritional Risk Score (NRS 2002) or Minimal Nutrition Assessment (MUST) or The Royal Free Hospital Nutrition Prioritizing Tool (RFH-NPT) for the determination of malnutrition. Sarcopenia in patients with HCC is associated with poor tolerance to therapy as well as increased mortality [453], [454] [455], [456],[457]. Low hand strength and low alpha angles (as measured by Body Impedance Analysis) may provide information on increased mortality risk [458]. Since most cases of HCC can be attributed to cirrhosis of the liver, nutritional measures such as energy and protein supplementation may be recommended in the management of sarcopenia.[458] Patients with HCC or CCA and malnutrition should receive process-oriented nutritional counselling from qualified nutritionists, including the use of enteral/parenteral nutrition if appropriate.[450] Palliative care in HCC/CCA palliative treatment is defined as an approach to improving the quality of life of patients and their families facing problems associated with a life-threatening illness.

Patients should be encouraged to communicate to the physician what up-to-date information is important to them, how comprehensive and detailed it is. Individual preferences regarding shared decision-making (e.g. on how to treat tumours) should also be clarified and taken into account [508], [509]. Possible treatment options and alternatives should be communicated and understood in a clear, realistic and effective manner throughout the course of illness and treatment and in a way that is understandable to patients [510], [512], [513], [514], [515], [516], [517].

Tumor patients prefer a patient-centred attitude of their doctors in the form of understanding, empathy and support, especially in unfavourable prognosis or in advanced disease stages [514], [515], [516]. Patients who perceived their doctor as empathic and attentive were more satisfied, less stressed psychologically and had higher self-efficacy [514][517], [518].

Other important risk factors for the development of gall bladder cancer are older age, obesity, a familial prevalence, and gallbladders polyps [542] [543].

This may be due to an intravascular fibrosis, which results in the diagnosis of long-term cardiovascular disease and endothelial carcinoma. © Oncology and Endocrinology on August 3, 2023 In contrast, HCC is characterized by arterial hypervascularization during the arterial phase and leakage during the venous phase or late phase. However, some small iCCAs may also exhibit artery hypervascularisation and thereby mimic hepatocellular carcinoma [571], [572]. The arterial stage not only helps in the diagnostic distinction between an HCC and an iCCA, but also in the clearer delineation of vascular anatomy before surgical resection [567], [568], compared to MRI, so contrast-enhanced CT is only limited in its ability to detect the spread of the tumor along the gallbladder [573]. An optimal protocol for the assessment of cholangiocarcinomas should include MRCP, conventional T1- and T2-weighted abdominal MRI sequences (including T1 in- and out-of-phase formation), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and multiphase contrast-enhanced sequences in the arterial, portal, venous, and delayed phases [5697], [573].",

Dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences show peripheral hyperintensification in the arterial phase, followed by progressive and concentric filling of the tumor with contrast agent. The pooling of contrast agent in the late phase is indicative of fibrosis and strongly suggests an iCCA. Magnetic resonance imaging with Cholangio-pancreatography (MRI/CPR) is helpful in visualizing the biliary tract and tissue structures and thereby accurately determining the anatomical extension of the tumour. The MRCP technique is used to determine the concentration of contrast agents between the T2 and T2-free MRCP sequences. In preparation for MRCP, patients should fast for at least 4 hours to minimize intestinal peristalsis and gastric secretion and maximize gallbladder excretion. Diagnostic contrast agents may be added to document the fluid signals in the T2-weighted and twelve-arm magnetic resonance imaging (TWI) signal. The DWI may be useful in the detection of tumors in the MRCP if it does not support the sensitivity of the tumor to DWI or if it increases the risk of chronic disease in the gall bladder [573]. It is well documented that DWI increases the diagnostic sensitivity of MRI for cholangiocarcinoma. Previous studies have documented an overlap of the dynamic contrast-enhancement patterns of small space-demanding intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (< 3 cm) and hepatocellular carcinomas [555], [561], [577], [578]. In such cases, diffusion-weighted imaging performed at a number of different b-values in the range of 0-800 s/mm2 can help distinguish iCCA from HCC [579], [580], [581], [582]. Similarly, DW MRI can help to give a benign image of malignant strictures from oncologic ogm oncology to hepatocell carcinoma and biliary tumors.",

The documentation of a range of ADCs specific to iCCA has been limited by the large variability of reported ADC levels. This variability, largely attributable to technical differences in imaging acquisition, has led researchers to consider the use of normalised ADCW to optimise the quantitative characterisation of lesions including iCCa. However, studies have shown that despite the high sequence variance observed in VCAs, the comparison of the DWMRI values with those of other MRWs in the MRW MRI was limited due to the high variability in reported ADc values. In another study, patients with less than one-third of the tumour with diffusion restriction compared to patients with more than one third of tumour diffusion restriction had a more advanced baseline TNM stage, a higher incidence of lymphatic invasion and lymph node metastases, and a higher rate of stromal metaplasia.

Strong consensus Especially before curative resections or minimally invasive interventional therapies, an accurate detection of the maximum spread of the tumour as well as the reference to all anatomically important structures is essential. MRI is distinguished in this task by its superior soft tissue contrast and is therefore considered to be the imaging method of choice for diagnosing the maximum extension of the cholangitis [573].

If curative intentional resection is possible, this is the preferred treatment for patients with hillary or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

In addition, increased morbidity is found even with successful drainage and a cause is suspected e.g. in the possible introduction of kei-men into the biliary system by the intervention therapy.

However, 56% of patients required percutaneous drainages in addition to the endo-scopic drainings. Drainage appears to be impractical in Western countries [679] and does not appear to offer any advantage over a plastic stent implantation [680]. Although the risk of tumor cell entrainment through the access route of drainage is rare, it is observed after PTCD but not after endoscopic therapy [681], [682]. Prior to augmentation procedures of the liver (e.g. portal vein embolization), at least biliary drenage of future liver remnant tissue should be performed [683]. The draining of liver tissue to be removed has only a minor effect on hypertrenduction [684].
