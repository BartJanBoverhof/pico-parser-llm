      "text": "With the exception of biological abnormalities considered not to imply a life-threatening prognosis, which can be managed as Grade 3 effects. MEDICAL NEEDS Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common of the liver cancers (approximately 90%) 1 with an estimated incidence in France of approximately 9,600 new cases per year in 2018 2. This type of liver cancer develops most often on a renal cirrhosis (80% to 90% of cases) of various types (primary hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, diabetes mellitus). The prognosis of primary liver cancer remains one of the worst of all cancers with a 5-year survival rate of less than 15%.3 The management of HCC depends on the stage of the disease and the general condition of the patients4,5,6,7. Unlike other solid tumors, for which the therapeutic decision is made based on the TNM classification, there is no consensus prognostic classification for HCC7. Therefore, several classifications or scores have been proposed including the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 8 classification which has the advantage of enabling a prognosis stratification and proposing a treatment algorithm. When HCC is at an early stage (BC 0-A), patients are generally eligible for curative treatment by surgery, radiosurgery or transplantation. In case of failure, refractory disease or ineligibility for TACE, or in the presence of vascular invasion and/ or extrahepatic injury (advanced stage CLC), treatment with sorafenib is recommended in patients with preserved general condition (ECOG ≤ 2) and preserved hepatic function (Child-Pugh A). In adult patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (stage BCLC B or C) who have not received prior systemic therapy, the medical need is therefore considered to be partially met by sorafenib. However, there remains a medical need for better tolerated and/ or more effective treatments at this stage of the disease.",

The demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between the groups.
