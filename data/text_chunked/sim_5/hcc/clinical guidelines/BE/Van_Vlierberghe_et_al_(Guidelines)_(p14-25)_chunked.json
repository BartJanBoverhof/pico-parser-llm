      "text": "Introduction\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary tumour of the liver. Its behaviour is rather peculiar with prognosis made out not only by the tumoural disease but also\nby the severity of the underlying liver disease. Worldwide it is a major problem. In the West,however,\nthe prevalence is lower than in developing countries. However due to a rise in HCV induced liver cirrhosis,\nHCC becomes more prevalent in Belgium. In the\nHepCar registry (a Belgian registry where on a voluntary basis, patients with HCC are reported), 70 patients\n(51 male / 19 female) were reported between January\n2003 and September 2003. Median age was 62 years ±\n12.",

Due to this changing pattern of HCC in Belgium, a\nBASL working group was founded to discuss and report on guidelines in epidemiology,screening,diagnosis and\ntreatment of HCC. These guidelines are a result of a discussion between the different members of the working\ngroup reflecting data published in literature and taking into account the specific Belgian situation.
