Furthermore, it must be noted that no usable data are available for the selection of specific AEs. In this situation, it is conceivable that the overall conclusion on added benefit may change materially if the missing information became available, since the presented event rates also reveal potential disadvantages of lenvatinib. For this reason, it is not possible to adequately weigh all positive and negative effects of lenvatinib. For research question 1, an added benefit of lenvatinib is therefore not proven.
