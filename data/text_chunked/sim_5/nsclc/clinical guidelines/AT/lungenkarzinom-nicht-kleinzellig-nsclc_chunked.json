The mesothelioma screening programs of the SUVA (Swiss Accident Insurance Institution) for people with asbestos and the German statutory accident insurance in occupational risk exposures have also detected people with lung cancer.

Pancoast tumors (synonym: Superior Sulcus Tumor) are a distinct entity [115]. Characteristic symptoms result from the consequences of local growth, starting from the lung tip, with infiltration of neural (brachial plexus, ganglion stellatum) or osseous structures (ribs, vertebral bodies). Optimal local imaging by thoracic MRI is crucial for therapy planning. It is the basis for assessing operability, in particular the relationship to the brachial plexus, possibly to the neuroforamines or the vertebrate bodies. A close coordination between the conservative and surgical disciplines (thoracic surgery and possibly neurosurgery) is crucial, especially with regard to the question of operability after induction radiochemotherapy. In many patients, a local, operative procedure is not possible, these patients should receive maintenance therapy with Durumavalb after radio-chemotherapy at a PDL1 expression of ≥ 1%.",
