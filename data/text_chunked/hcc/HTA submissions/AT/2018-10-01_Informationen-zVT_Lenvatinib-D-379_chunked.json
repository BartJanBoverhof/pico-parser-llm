The key questions were identified in the interdisciplinary consensus at the first working meeting (Kick-off Meeting). In order to be able to answer the key questions, a conceptual presentation of their statements and the international literature guidelines based on them were developed. A second meeting, attended by all the mandate holders of the different professional societies and institutions, clarified the basis on which the key questions should be answered (de-novo research, guideline adaptation or pure expert consensus).Search period: In October 2009 and January 2010, a central and systematic search was carried out for guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, published either in English or German between January 2000 and November 2009. • Validity after review by the LL Secretariat extended until",
