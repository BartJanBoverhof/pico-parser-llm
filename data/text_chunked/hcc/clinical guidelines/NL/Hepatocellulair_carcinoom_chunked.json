It covers the following topics: Surveillance, diagnosis, stereotactic radiotherapy, palliative system therapy, radiation embolization, surgery, follow-up and aftercare. Who is this directive aimed at? The Directive applies to all adult patients with HCC and to adult patients at increased risk of HCC who need to be included in a surveillance programme. The Directive is limited to patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis where this is indicated. Scope The Directive addresses all professionals involved in second or third line surveillance, diagnosis and treatment and counselling of patients with Hepatocellulare carcinomas. For hepatocell carcinom patients, this Directive is a care system in the form of surgical diagnosis, treatment and how to deal with liver cancer. How did the directive come about?",

Recommendation Recommandation-1 Consider including the patient at significantly increased risk for HCC in a surveillance programme. This includes the possibility of HCC therapy in case of detection and the a priori likelihood of developing HCC and the prevalence of benign nodules in this patient. Therefore, a good result is not a guarantee that there is no abnormality. Approximately 1 to 2 out of 10 people participating in liver cancer surveillance will receive a ' false alarm ' at some point within three years. This may lead to stress, unnecessary (retrospective) additional examinations and a small risk of complications. *Consider abandoning surveillance in the absence of cirrhosis, positive family history, viral coinfection or metabolic risk cofactors in the event of a low mPAGE-B score and tenofovir/ entecavir treatment.

Africa in the absence of cirrhosis or other risk-enhancing factors at low mPage-B score surveillance may be waived (Patmore 2023).

Meta-analyses suggest that MRI is more sensitive and specific than ultrasound for the detection of HCC, both curative stage and all stages: both standard MRI and MRI with shortened protocol/no contrast). However, there are few studies comparing MRI and echo in the same patient (none in a Western setting), and insufficient data on risks of MRI (especially in long-term surveillance) and on cost-benefit analysis. Because of the inadequate quality of true surveillance, surveillance by means of MRI with or without alpha-fetoprotein is the preferred method. Background Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is done in patients at increased risk of this malignancy. Meta-analyses and research in the Dutch setting show that surveillance is associated with HCC detection at an earlier stage, more frequent use of curative therapy, and better survival (Singapore, Sub-Saharan Africa, 2015; 2022).

The CMRI included T1-weighted imaging, DWI, T2WI and contrast-enhanced gadoxetic acid (Primovist®) T1-weighed imaging. The cause of the chronic liver disease was hepatitis B virus in 56%, hepatitis C virus in 29% and alcohol in 11%. The index test consisted of MRI-scan comprising respiratory-gated DWI. MRI lesions were considered suspicious if they had elevated signal on high b value DWI and were iso or hypointense to liver background on the ADC map. During the study, six patients were diagnosed with HCC which results in an incidence of 3 percent. The MRI was used as a replacement test for U.S.",

      "text": "Baseline question What modality and scan protocol are indicated for diagnosis of HCC? Recommendation Consider using MRI with contrast instead of CT in patients with cirrhosis suspected of having HCC seen on the ultrasound in the primary diagnosis. Given the cost, extracellular gadolinium is preferred over liver-specific contrast. If MRI is not possible technically, for example by implants, or from the patient's point of view (e.g. claustrophobia), it can be replaced by CT. When HCC is diagnosed with CT, additional MRI is only needed when policy implications are expected. Considerations Pros and cons of the intervention and the quality of evidence Dr systematic reviews were included (Roberts, 2018; Chen, 2019; Li, 2022). The literature for comparing multiphase contrast with CT for patients with liver cancer includes a portion of additional studies (2028) conducted on the same patients. Both systematic literature reviews included patients with cirrhosis of the liver. Both Roberts (2018) and Chen (2022) also included primary studies that were not included by the other, and performed meta-analyses with them. Therefore, both systematic reviews were discussed, although there is a large overlap. With low certainty, caused by a risk of distortion and the heterogeneity between the primary studies, MRI with extracellular contrast agent seems to have a slightly higher sensitivity than CT scan.

These results and ratings appear to be in line with the included systematic literature studies that have been able to directly compare CT and MRI.

The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) states in its guideline that prospective studies with a direct comparison appear to be lacking (Galle, 2018). The search query in the current module set off against CT MRI, which did not specifically search for studies that examined the MRI contrast agents head-to-head. Therefore, there is no certainty that there are no prospect studies on this subject, especially any studies that might have appeared after the EASL guidelines.

This categorization system is specifically applied to patients with risk factors for developing hepatocellular carcinoma, such as cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B, or a history of prior hepatocell carcinooma (American college of radiology, 2018) There are 2 categorizations systems, namely Hepatocellulare carcinom for CTRI/MRI and for radiochemistry.",

The CT/MRI LI-RADS algorithm categorizes observations into probability levels in which a hepatocellulose cancer could be present. These range from LR-1 (certainly benign) to LR-5 (certainty of a hepatocellular cancer). Categories also exist for non-classifiable (LR-NC), probably certain or malignant but not necessarily a liver-cellular cancer (LRM) and a certain enlargement of the tumor in a vein (LRTIV). Diagnosis is based on various combinations of 5 important features and several attendant features. The main features are: presence of increased leakage in the arterial phase (non-peripheral ring size), non-mean outer ring size, decrease in capsule size, and <50% increase in subsequent growth. the lesion size, capsular discolouration, and increase in size between successive examinations (>50% growth in <6 months). The ancillary features are divided into 3 groups: general features advocating malignancy, general features supporting HCC, and general characteristics supporting benignity. The algorithm and exact categorization can be found in the LI-RADS CT/MRI description, see the most recent",

The contrast agent used for MRIs is also less nephrotoxic compared to the CT scan, but is more burdensome to the environment. It is important that the imaging has a high probability of a correctly positive classification when the disease is actually present and thus also gives few false-negative classifications. For the diagnosis of HCC in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, the sensitivity of MRI appears to be higher than that of CT, with similar specificity. The imaging sensitivities for the diagnostic of HCH are lower in small lesions (<10mm and 11-20mm). Due to the indirect comparison between studies included in the literature analysis, the choice of a contrast agent for MRI over another contrast agent based on the accuracy seems to be insufficiently substantiated at this time. The cost of liver-specific contrast agents is much higher than the cellular malignancy agent. Gadolinium contrast medium is very well",

It is substantiated that the majority of nodes smaller than 1 centimeter often do not turn out to be malignant there, and the decrease of a biopt at such small nodes gives a large probability of positive sampling (EASL, 2018). Diagnostic yield is dependent on the diagnosis of the size of the node, and differentiation of the tumor size. Also, a study of the biopsy of the liver less than 2 cm was described in 2008 (Forner et al., 2018).

Finally, it is stated that the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients without cirrhosis cannot be made without a biopsy (Marrero, 2018). The guideline of the ESMO (European Society for Medical Oncology; Vogel, 2018) indicates that a second biopsy, another imaging modality with contrast agent, or a resection of the lesion may be considered if the first tumor biopsy does not seem to reveal a focal lesion. A second ton biopsy or resection could be considered in patients who are eligible for resection with an acceptable risk of morbidity and mortality (Vogel, 2018.) The ESMO guidelines state that it is important to differentiate between a hepatocell carcinom with a cholangiocarcinoma and a hepatic cell carcinome because the latter might indicate potential therapeutic differences from a collateral cancer. In addition, in highly differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas, signs of malignancy, such as interstitial or vascular invasion, are often not detectable through a biopsy according to the Directive (Vogel, 2018).",

Recommendation To be decided multidisciplinarily in a centre with expertise in the treatment of HCC (as described in SONCOS guidelines 2023) or for patients with HCC with BCLC stage 0 -B, in whom no resection or ablation is possible, TARE or TACE is preferred. Consideration should be given to preferring TARE over TACE if one or more of the following factors are present: Presence of portal venous thrombus (PVT) Failure of TACE (or not possible) Size (approximately > 5 cm) Number of tumours (> 3-5) Selection of BCLC segments (> 2) on the basis of a dose of TARE for portal thrombosis and self-triggering of the tumour should be based on a safe, adequate and effective dose to deliver TARE to the patient. Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were selected and designed (Dhondt, 2022; Kolligs, 2015; Pitton, Salem, 2015); only RCTs were included in the analysis, resulting in a high quality of evidence.",

In the case of TARE, which uses complex radioactive medical devices for Hepatocellular carcinoma, it is currently a logistical and financial challenge for HCCE due to the limited technical means available and at the same time a significant financial challenge. In the Netherlands and other countries, TARE is currently part of the paid care for HCC. This makes TARE routine care, which further complicates the conduct of (comparative) studies. Patients and practitioners often prefer the study arm (TARE) compared to the control arm (TACE). The laborious and long-term inclusion of the PREMIERE study (Salem, 2016) is an example of this. As a result, the resulting studies often have a limited study population, despite long term inclusion, and for this reason were often terminated prematurely. Moreover, the available data is limited and does not go beyond progression-free survival. However, for TARE in this setting, the value of available data remains the same.",

This led to the inclusion of TARE in the BCLC schedule as an alternative treatment for HCC patients in whom conventional ablative techniques are not feasible or have failed (Salem, 2021; Kim, 2022). In the largest cohort study in 209 patients (BCLC A, n=27; BCLC B, n = 68; BCLC C, n=\"114) a response was found in 62% of patients, with a median survival of 20.3 months (95% CI = 16.7 to 26.4 months) ((Lamzi, 2022)).",

This may also be expected of resin versus glass 90Y-TARE, however, there have never been conducted head-to-head studies. In the daily routine, the available products will be used interchangeably, with holmium-166 (166Ho) -TARE (Reinders, 2022) showing similar results. The Netherlands Institute of Healthcare therefore considers the three different products as technically equivalent variants of TARE. Advantages and disadvantages of the intervention (TARE) TACE was considered in the analysis as the control arm because it is currently the (international) standard of care in irresectable BCLC 0-B patients for whom ablative techniques are not possible. The main studies conducted to TACE versus best supportive care included tumors with a smaller average size of 4.9 cm (Llovet, 2002) and 7.0 cm (Lo, 2001) with an average of 2.8 TACE treatments (range 1-8) and 4.5 TACE therapies (ranges 1 to 15), respectively.

Several studies provided evidence for this approach in HCC (Garin, 2021). In the DOSISPHERE-01 study, 60 intermediate/advanced stage BCLC B-C HCC patients were randomised for both approaches. The response found doubled in the study arm (36% versus 71%; p < 0.0001), leading to improvements in overall and progression-free survival. It is likely that when using an individual treatment plan for TARE, outcomes will further improve compared to TACE. In the Netherlands, this individualized approach is widely used and considered state-of-the-art TARE where published international guidelines can be consulted (Weber, 2022). A disadvantage of TARE is the complexity of the entire treatment pathway.",

Both TACE and TARE are well tolerated, there is no evidence that TACE or TARE would cause more or fewer complications. Cost (spending) Several studies have been conducted on the cost-effectiveness of TARE compared to TACE. In a study from the United States in >5000 HCC patients from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database (solitaire HCC cm; bridging transplantation) ablation to thermal had the best cost effectiveness, followed by TARE. In terms of cost-efficiency, TACE had a better cost/benefit ratio compared to TARE with a mean of $29,600 USD.

This again includes the number of TACE treatments needed to adequately treat the more extensively spread disease, which plays a major role in the higher cost-efficiency of TAE compared to TACE (Rostambeigi, 2014). This was confirmed with clinical data (Kudo, 2014; Yamakado, 2014). Partly for this reason, experts recommend applying TACE super-selectively, in patients with <5 tumors, with a maximum of two affected segments, and only in tumors <5 cm (de Baere, 2022). For BCLC-C based on porta thrombosis, TARE is preferred. Presence of PVT, the number of treatment cycles required (cost-effectiveness), tumor size and tumor number are important criteria that can determine the individual choice for TARE, especially if drawing up a personalized treatment plan is included in it.

In some studies, there was a risk of bias due to, among other things, insufficient documentation, loss of follow-up and blindness. In addition, the study findings were sometimes difficult to compare because the control interventions and populations differed (indirectness) and there were multiple studies with a relatively small population and, as a result, a large spread of the point estimator of the outcome (precision), which also depended on the lack of quality of this evidence. In addition, recurrence rates are currently low even for larger lesions (3 to 5 cm) when using advanced planning software, needle positioning systems, multiple needles, and/or confirmatory software (Beermann, 2020; Laimer, 2020); Schullian, 2022).",

There were significant differences between the different studies in the materials used and the interval between TACE and ablation. There is no clear recommendation at this time as to which techniques are preferred (RFA or MFA, conventional TACE or TACE drug-eluting) or whether the interval should be maintained between TACE and ablation (Hendriks, 2021). Eight studies were included in the TACE study and one was included in combination therapy prior to ablation and the same analysis has been performed in several studies with TACE. In conclusion, the eight included studies show evidence of a possible positive effect of the combination of TACE and ablation on overall survival, disease-free survival and local tumour control in patients with tumours ranging from 3 to 5 cm. However, the included studies did not find a significantly higher rate of complications in the combination of TACE and ablation compared to ablation alone, but the quality of the evidence for this was assessed as very uncertain.

Acceptability, feasibility and implementation The Working Group considers that there are no objections or conditions to the acceptability of the recommendation. Rationale for the Recommendation: Weighing arguments for and against the interventions There are several randomized studies demonstrating that the combination of TACE plus ablation is superior to ablation alone in patients with HCC greater than 3 cm. We calculated a relative risk of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.166 to 0.66) and 0.52 (0.6582) for overall survival and 1 year and 3 years respectively for the combined treatment, but this has not resulted in a favourable recommendation from the underlying GRADE systematic clinical trials. In contrast, not only do the various studies indicate a beneficial effect, but also the rationale for neoadjuvant TACE is strong: first, TACE leads to shrinkage of a lesion, making it easier to completely ablate a leson with sufficient margin; second, due to the closure of tumor-feeding arteries, there is a smaller chance of recurrence as a result of atinks; and third, for any treatment with satellite TACE, there are greater frequencies of abscesses, especially those that occur in the immediate vicinity of HCCs and outside of the primary lesion.",

In larger tumors, greater resection is usually preferred. In general, thanks to local resection, improvements in tumour resection are expected to continue for up to 3 years after ablation, and even better results are obtained in tumoral resection after more than 3 cm. However, ablation outcomes have steadily improved in recent years, due to improvements in ablation systems and needle positioning, with a significant proportion of patients with tumors >2 cm not being candidates for resection, as a result of cirrhosis with portal hypertension, advanced age, co-morbidity and/or an unfavourable location of the tumor. To increase the effectiveness of ablation in larger tumors, several trials have been conducted combining ablation with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).",

Both studies did not show evidence of superior efficacy of ART over sorafenib on overall survival and progression-free survival. However, there was no clinically relevant difference in tumour response to ART compared to Sorafenib. Firstly, the systemic therapy used in the studies (sorafenib) is less potent than the current standard combination treatment of atezolizumab with bevacizumab; secondly, technically secondary dosimetry of TARE has been used in currently included studies; the studies used the so-called body surface area (BSA) method to calculate activity; this method does not take into account the actual dose in the tumour and surrounding liver tissue, and leads to structural cell-mediated dosing. This was also demonstrated in a post hoc analysis of the SARAH study (Hermann, 2020).",

However, one of the inclusion criteria of the IMbrave 150 study was that there were no longer any local treatment options. This was further confirmed by an update of the IMbrave 150 study one year after the primary analysis (Cheng, 2022). In addition, consideration should be given to whether the individual patient is expected to benefit from systemic therapy or from TARE, taking into account, among other factors, the course of disease, underlying liver disease and function, portal hypertension, autoimmune co-morbidity, and cardiovascular status. However, studies are conflicting on the associations between underlying disorders and effectiveness of immunotherapy (Pister 202fister, 2021; Espinoza, Houma, 2020). Therefore, it is recommended that each patient be enrolled in a multidisciplinary team of experts in order to prioritize TARE versus TARE for their patients, and in particular to ensure that the right decision is made with patients at the appropriate table of expertise and in the best interest of the patient.

Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse reactions were equal to 43% in the atezolizumab and bevacizumab group versus 46% with sorafenib. Aspects to be monitored are whether there are contraindications to immunotherapy and whether therapeutic enzyme antagonism is used. This should be taken into account when treating with atezolubeva plus bevazizumab. However, if a rapid response is desired, lenvatinib should be preferred over sorafenib (ORR lenvantinib 40.6% compared to 12.4% with bevacizumab). Treatment-related Grade 3-4 adverse reactions of Sorafenib versus Lenvatinib were similar, but the pattern of reactions was different.

Recommendation Inform patients and family/neighbours about the possible emergence of complaints after treatment of HCC. Report these early consequences of cancer using a (validated) screening tool. This screening should be used from diagnosis to treatment and follow-up. Considerations Disease and treatment have major consequences The Health Council concludes that many patients, after intentional curative treatment for cancer, suffer from complaints (Health Council, 2007). These complaints may be limited or extensive, both physical and psychological in nature, and may occur early or later. This is called distress. By distress is meant: an unpleasant emotional experience of a psychological (cognitive, behavioural, emotional), social and/or spiritual nature that may interfere with the ability to effectively cope with cancer, the accompanying physical symptoms and treatment (Guideline on detecting the need for psychosocial care, 2017). These are mostly physical consequences that are clearly linked to the specific nature of the cancer, consequences of the treatment, psychsocial problems and general complaints. General problems may be in the areas of relationships with partner and",

Examples of complaints at a more advanced stage include fatigue, abdominal pain, poor appetite, nausea/vomiting, weight loss (Sun, 2008). Patients with cirrhosis are at increased risk of HCC. The early consequences for this group of patients are often related to liver failure. Symptoms of liver failure include jaundice, ascites, headache, fatigue and encephalopathy. Psychiatric complaints that have occurred include problems with concentration and memory, anxiety, depression, anger, sadness, reduced self-esteem, tiredness, loneliness, doubts about the prognosis and problems with psychological controls (Guideline Restoration of Nazism's Signaling System).

These results and ratings appear to be in line with the included systematic literature studies that have been able to compare CT and MRI with each other. 8: Hepatocellular carcinoma: Based on the included literature, there are only indirect comparisons to be made for the type of contrast agent for MRI. In this indirect comparison, MRI with gadoxetic acid appears to generally have higher accuracy than extracellular contrast (Chen, 2022; Li, 2019; Roberts, 2018). The implicit comparison reduces the certainty in the evidence and makes it difficult to make a judgment on which contrast agent is preferred based on the reported accurate parameters. The parameters could, for example, vary due to differences in the study design, setting and previous testing, or different characteristics in the sample.",

However, studies are conflicting on the associations between underlying disorders and effectiveness of immunotherapy (Pister 202f, 2021; Espinoza, Houma, 2020).
