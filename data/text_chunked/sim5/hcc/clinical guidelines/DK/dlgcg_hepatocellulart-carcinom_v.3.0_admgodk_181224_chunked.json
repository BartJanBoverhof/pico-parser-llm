Patient group The most common cause of cirrhosis (about 65%) in Denmark is alcohol consumption (2). The incidence and prevalence of cirrosis is relatively stable, but the underlying causes are changing in these years as alcohol-related cirrhomosis and Hep B+C decline, while fat-related Cirrhomoses have an increasing trend. Diagnosis and treatment of HCC involve physicians from different specialties, including medics with internal hepatological expertise (hereinafter referred to as hepato-implantation surgeons), HP/transplantation surgists, oncologists, radiologists, and interventional pathologists.",

Finally, deciding what action an abnormal screen test should trigger. The risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis over a period of 5 years is about 7%. Since some groups of patients with Chronic Hepatitis B have an increased incidence of hepatocell carcinomas (hCC) even without having developed cirrhotic disease, screening for HCC should be performed in patients who have a family history of HCC, Asian patients over 40-50 years of age, and African patients over the age of 25 years.",

At the same time, the presence of small foci of HCC in these resects typically suggests that these lesions are pre-stages to typical HCC (37, 38, 40). The frequency with which such lesions develop into HCC is typically unknown; in contrast, HCC has well-defined stages and exhibits a distinct histological continuum between the ultradiagnostic and typical margins (24, 40). There is likely to be a continuum between HGDN and HCC rather than two distinct stages.

Radioembolization (selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT)) may be envisaged as downstaging to achieve resectability or Milan criteria for transplantation. Stereotactic radiation therapy (SBRT) provides precise radiation to a well-defined target volume, usually with few fractions and a high dose per fraction. Phase I and Phase II studies of SBRT of HCC show that radiation treatment can be administered with low risk and limited side effects to patients with Child Pugh A, maximum tumour diameter of 5 cm and adequate liver volume (83). Several publications show that children with Child-Pugh B and C developed irreversible liver failure, which is why those with child Pugh scores > 7 are not recommended for stereotactic irradiation (84, 85).",
