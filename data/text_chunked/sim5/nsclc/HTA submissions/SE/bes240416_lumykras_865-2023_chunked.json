The company believes that they would not be able to short-circuit the entire docetaxel population of ECO G PS 0 or ECO B PS 1 if the median duration of the adoption of the Code is approximately one month. The reduction in overall survival (1 month) is based on data from CodeBreaK 200 where patients could be randomised to docetaxel and thus were not unsuitable for docetaxil. The decrease in total survival for Lumykras may be greater than 1 month, especially considering that higher ECOG PS than 1 may occur with",

However, the high cost per gain QALY is not affected to such an extent in poor survival as a result of patients not eligible for Docetaxel being in poor condition. These latter factors affect the cost per QALY downwards. None of the TLV' s calculations of the cost-effectiveness of Lumykras compared to best supportive care result in a cost per earned QALy higher than what TLV would normally assess as reasonable for a very high severity condition. Patients already continuing treatment with Lumykra are covered by the benefit of the limitation of patients not needing to discontinue a treatment interrupting the function of a TLV assessed in patients already continued treatment with subsidised Lumykrac on 1 June 2024.",
