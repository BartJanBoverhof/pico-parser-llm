We want to highlight the significant innovation Sotorassib brings to patients with incurable non-metastatic lung cancer with relapse after prior treatment. An innovation recognised by the EMA, which granted Sotorisib a conditional marketing authorisation due to the significant unmet need that Sotoresib addresses. We are therefore generally satisfied that the Medical Council considers that the studies used reflect Danish clinical practice and that the methods used allow for a health evaluation. However, there are issues in this assessment report that Amgen wishes to take the opportunity to comment on:",

      "text": "The Medical Council accepts the applicants' assumptions regarding administration and testing costs for sotorasib. Instead, the applicant applies a DRG rate for intravenous administration of docetaxel that includes the pharmaceutical price of Docetaxel, which means that the Applicant counts the drug cost for Docetaxil twice (unit cost of 17,556). Therefore, the Medical Council modifies the administration cost of Docettaxel to an administration visit. can it then be justified to reduce a rate by + DKK 15,000 on the basis that the rate would include a medicine costing DKK 150 per dose? If the Medical Council is uncertain about the risk of double counting, as described here, then the solution, in the light of this argument, should be to reduce the pharmaceutical cost of docetaxel to 0 instead. Considering that Amgen here has documented the choice of this rate by consulting two clinical experts at different hospitals who have consulted relevant staff in their respective departments about the rates applied for the administration of Docetaxel - and that the contact details of these clinicians are shared with the medical council - we do not find the above argumentation to be satisfactory.",

In this particular case, Amgen's analysis gives a QALY gain of 0.63 versus the Medicine Council's 0.52 and an ICER of approximately DKK 550,000/QALY versus Medicines Board's ICER (approximately DKK 839,000).

The inability to robustly match for number of prior lines of therapy or prior use of immunotherapy is a potential limitation that arises due to limited comparator trial data specifically in KRAS-mutant NSCLC.

Given that CodeBreak 100 included 57% of patients with 2 or more prior lines of therapy, a comparison of PFS and OS data from the whole of the CodeBreak 100 NSCLC population against PFS and OS data from patients in SELECT-1, who had received only one prior line of therapy, is likely to be conservative.

Adenocarcinomas develop from the mucus-producing cells of smaller airways along the periphery (outer edges) of the lung (14, 15).

The expected incremental costs as well as effects for sotorasib versus platinum-based\nchemotherapy as well as docetaxel are therefore assumed to be comparable. The best alternative to assessing\ncost-effectiveness versus platinum-based chemotherapy is to use data from the Flatiron database (Appendix L -\nFlatiron). These data are based on a basket of chemotherapy regimens, including platinum-based chemotherapy\nwhich is the most common regime in the basket (Table 60). This analysis was performed as a confirmatory analysis to validate the primary MAIC analysis of sotorasib versus docetaxel monotherapy using a basket of chemotherapies as a source to represent docetaxel. However, given that the most common chemoregimen in the basket of chemotherapy regimens in the Flatiron dataset was platinum-based chemotherapy the analysis also represent a pragmatic approach to show that the\nresult of sotorasib versus platinum-based chemo does not differ significantly from the comparison of sotorasib vs docetaxel.

This\napproach is deemed feasible as the global SLR was broader and will therefore have included all studies relevant for the scope of this application. The local adaptation was conducted to restrict the literature included in the global SLR to studies with either sotorasib or docetaxel in adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated in 2L+. The local adaptation only included comparator studies with sufficient sample size and reporting to allow for a\nMAIC, which was necessary as the primary evidence for sotorasib was a single-arm trial. These selection criteria\nwere applied to the studies as they reflect the EMA-indication and proposed scope of the application for sotorasib for KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC in Denmark.",

However, across both distributions, the AIC and BIC were not meaningfully different with little\nseparating the two. Given this, and consistent with the approach taken for OS, jointly fitted survival models\n(either restricted or unrestricted) were considered more appropriate to reduce uncertainty through the estimation of fewer parameters and the use of a larger data set. For the jointly fitted models, the AIC indicates that the generalized gamma distribution is the best performing, whereas the BIC indicates that the log-normal provides the best statistical fit to the observed data, although\nagain differences are minor. In this instance, the BIC statistic was preferred as its use mitigates the risk of\noverfitting statistical noise in the tails of the observed distributions.

The indirect treatment comparison suggests that sotorasib provides a superior\ntreatment option for these patients compared to docetaxel, providing PFS and OS gains which exceed the minimally clinical important differences of 3 months, previously defined by the lung cancer expert committee at\nDMC(7). Health economic analysis demonstrates that sotorasib is a more effective and more costly treatment option compared to docetaxel that would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 750,000 DKK per QALY. The interpretation of the current clinical evidence is somewhat limited by the current lack of a direct comparison between sotorasib and docetaxel.",

Several published observational studies in Western (European, Australian and US) populations show that survival in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC is similarly poor as that in patients with other KRAS mutations or\nwild type disease who are not eligible for existing targeted therapies (72, 128, 129).",

The approach attempted to mimic the effect of randomization by creating a balance between the sotorasib treated and the chemotherapy-treated real-world patients with respect to important available baseline covariates that determine both the propensity for a patient to be treated (with the treatment under evaluation) and a patient’s prognosis. To mimic the treatment effect compared to a hypothetical comparator arm in the CodeBreak 100 trial, the ATT was calculated, assigning weights to the subjects in the comparator arm (Flatiron propensity weighting score analysis). The advantage of utilizing a propensity score analysis is to create a balance across",

Such a balance, if adequately achieved, would limit bias and thus reinforce the validity of a statistical comparison of the clinical outcomes of sotorasib treated subjects vs. patients treated with chemotherapy-based standard of care. Due to sample size restrictions, and based on clinical expertise, the comparator cohort captured 206 patients with any KRAS mutation; including 85 patients with KRAS G12C . The rationale for restricting this analysis to chemotherapy-based treatment was to achieve a comparison most relevant for future reimbursement situations. In particular, PD-(L)1 therapy was disregarded from the comparator arm, as it is normally used in 1L in current clinical practice (clinical advisory board (11 February 2011) conducted by Amgen (138). For validity assessment, a Cox regression model was also run where the comparator cohort was restricted to KRAS G12C patients only.",
