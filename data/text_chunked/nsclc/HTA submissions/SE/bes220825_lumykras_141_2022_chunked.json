      "text": "Lumykras as monotherapy is intended for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a KRAS G12C mutation, in case of progression after at least one previous line of systemic therapy. In NSCLC, there are several different molecular changes that drive the growth of cancer cells. One of these changes is the KRAS g12c mutation. The company states that docetaxel monotherapy is a relevant comparative alternative to Lumykra monotherapies in adult patients with advanced NSCLC with a KRAS G12C mutation, following progression from at least one prior line of systemic therapy, and justifies this as follows: according to clinical expertise referenced by the company, the majority of patients receive pemetrexed in the first line of therapy; since re-treatment with the same medicinal product is not recommended, docetaxal is the remaining treatment option for most patients with tumour progression. The indirect comparison shows a longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survivorship (OS) with sotorasib compared to docetaxel.",

      "text": "The drug cost of Lumykras is SEK 61,000 per month at the recommended dose (960 mg/ day). The corresponding cost for docetaxil is less than SEK 1,000 per month. There is an additional cost for intravenous administration every three weeks. docetaxel measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) is weighted against the cost difference in the measure of cost per QALY achieved. The analysis is performed from a lifetime perspective, which means that PFS and OS are extrapolated beyond the time horizon of the respective studies. According to the company, clinical experts consulted by the company have assessed that the survival rate in the extrapolations for docetaxil is clinically reasonable at year 5 and that a small proportion can even live beyond 10 years. According the company t a on a, the same clinical expert assessed the extrapolation that gives poorer results showed short survival. However, a Swedish clinical specialist consulted with the company has indicated that the modelled survival at docetax years 5 and 10 may be exaggerated in the company' s baseline scenario. The company uses a statistical model of the health cycle of the patient based on the analysis of the LumBore estimate of the time of death of 100 patients at different health intervals compared to the estimated duration of treatment.",

In general TLV considers that indirect comparisons have a lower evidence value than direct comparison studies because they are associated with greater uncertainties.

TLV further objects to the company' s method of measuring health-related quality of life by time to death. This means that patients already at the start of treatment have a poorer health- related Quality of Life in the docetaxel arms than in the Lumykras arms, as more patients in the former are predicted to die within a certain period of time. This violates a fundamental modelling principle that the starting point of the model analysis should be as close as possible to the patient.",

As studies are ongoing for further indications, the TLV finds reasons to limit the subsidy indication to the currently approved indication. The Committee considers that the overall TLV benefit criteria in Section 15 of the Act are met only if the price restrictions for the grant application have been fulfilled, and therefore an appeal must be lodged in accordance with Section 11 of the NDA as set out below.
