      "text": "Providing standardised clinical care to patients in healthcare is challenging. This is due to a number of\nfactors, among them variations in environments of care and complex patient presentations. It is selfevident that safe, effective care and treatment are important in ensuring that patients get the best\noutcomes from their care. The Department of Health is of the view that supporting evidence-based practice, through the clinical effectiveness framework, is a critical element of the health service to deliver safe and high quality care. The National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) is a Ministerial committee set up in 2010 as a key recommendation of the report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance (2008). The\nestablishment of the Commission was prompted by an increasing awareness of patient safety issues in general and high profile health service system failures at home and abroad. The NCEC on behalf of the Department of Health has embarked on a quality assured National Clinical\nGuideline development process linked to service delivery priorities. Furthermore, implementing National\nClinical Guidelines sets a standard nationally, to enable healthcare professionals to deliver safe and effective care and treatment while monitoring their individual, team and organisation’s performance.",

Deaths from cancer averaged about 8,655 deaths per year during 2011-2013, representing about 30% all deaths in that period (NCRI, 2016). Lung cancer was the single most common cause of cancer death in Ireland from 2011-2012 (See Secti\n3.1 Epidemiology). Averaging 1,827 deaths annually, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer dea\nin both sexes (NCRI, 2016). The incidence of lung cancer in Ireland is projected to rise more rap\nin females than in males. By 2040 the rate of lung cancer is projected to increase by 136% in fem\n(Nordpred model) and 52% in males (NCRI, 2014). Cancer incidence data from the National Cancer Registry Ireland (NCRI) and population projections fr the Central Statistics Office (CSO) have been combined by the NCRI to estimate the number of new can\ncases expected in five year bands from 2015 to 2040.",

The studies of follow-up care after potentially curative resection included patients\nwith stages I to III disease, reflecting the stage of disease deemed appropriate for curative intent treatment. They showed a general trend for improvement in survival favoured more intensive followup: Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.83 (0.66 –1.05), but this was not statistically significant (p=0.13). Between-study\nheterogeneity was low. High rates of relapse (between 21% and 71%) were reported even when curative\ntreatment was intended. In the curative intent subgroup, all the studies found that asymptomatic\nrecurrence was associated with a significantly longer survival time: HR 0.61 (0.50–0.74) (p<0.01), with\na low level of heterogeneity.

Advantages of rigid bronchoscopic procedures under general anaesthesia include the\nability to remove large pieces of cancer, maintain adequate ventilation, and allow control of large volume haemorrhage. Nonetheless, flexible bronchoscopy is increasingly used for debulking procedures. These\ntreatments are usually given to palliate symptoms and improve quality of life, but in some patients, relief of endobronchial obstruction will allow assessment for subsequent treatment with curative intent. (NICE,\nEndobronchial techniques available are either a) used to debulk the cancer (brachytherapy, electrocautery, cryotherapy, thermal laser ablation and photodynamic therapy) or b) used to maintain/\nre-establish airway patency (endobronchial stenting). Thermal ablation, surgical debulking and stent\ninsertion were all favoured options where immediate relief of endobronchial obstruction is required, especially if there is a relatively large cancer.",

In order to ensure the maximum sparing\nof normal tissues, three-dimensional treatment planning is mandatory (Senan et al., 2004). However,\ndefining limits of dose tolerated by these tissues is complex as these limits vary according to the total dose delivered, fractionation regimen and use of concurrent chemotherapy (Milano et al., 2007, Schultheiss et\nal., 1995, van Baardwijk et al., 2008a, van Baardwijk et al., 2008b).

Bronchopulmonary toxicity (grade 3 or higher) was similar in both groups (≤2%). Oesophageal toxicity (grade 3 or higher) was 6.6% in the TRT arm and 0% in the non-TRT arm (p<.001). The study concluded that TRT improves overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer, with a small incremental risk of oesophageal toxicity. Future randomised trials to identify possible survival benefits of TRT dose escalation in patients with extensivestage small-cell lung cancer would assist clinicians in selecting the optimal dose while minimising oesophageal toxicity. Consolidation prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is recommended in patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) having a response to chemoradiotherapy. In combined modality care, thoracic radiotherapy is recommended in patients with limited- stage SCLC and should be initiated as early as possible. Consolidation PCI is recommended in patients with extensive-stage SCLC having a response to chemotherapy. Consolidation thoracic radiotherapy may be considered in patients with extensive-stage SCLC having a response to chemotherapy.",

Several drivers of cost, such\nas over-use, rapid expansion, and shortening life cycles of cancer technologies (such as medicines and imaging modalities), and the lack of suitable clinical research and integrated health economic studies,\nhave converged with more defensive medical practice, a less informed regulatory system and a lack of evidence-based sociopolitical debate.

Another reason for conclusions on cost-effectiveness to differ between countries relates to the prevailing cost-effectiveness threshold. While Ireland has no explicit cost-effectiveness threshold for non-drug\ninterventions, cost-effectiveness ratios falling within the region of €45,000/QALY are conventionally considered cost-effective in Ireland. As this threshold differs from the thresholds typically used in other\ncountries the statements of cost-effectiveness made in other contexts are not necessarily applicable to Ireland. In all cases possible the relevant Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) have been\nreported, thereby permitting comparison to the Irish threshold rather than relying on the original conclusion of each study relative to any national norms of cost-effectiveness in each case. It should be\nnoted that there are constraints regarding cost-utility and heterogeneity of practice.",

For example, Ireland’s discount rate is higher than that\napplied in the UK, so many interventions assessed in the UK would have less favourable ratios if the Irish discount rate was applied. Similarly, some analyses are conducted from the societal perspective and may\naccount for more costs and benefits than are considered in Irish cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs), which only account for costs to the health sector and do not typically include non-health benefits.

The evidence suggests that SBRT is less costly than surgery in high-risk patients with early stage NSCLC. However, surgery met the standard for cost-effectiveness due to a longer expected overall survival. This\nis supported by recommendation 2.7.1.1. The evidence also suggests that SBRT compared to 3D-CRT and RFA, was the most cost-effective treatment for medically inoperable early stage NSCLC. This is also supported by recommendation 2.7.1.1.",
