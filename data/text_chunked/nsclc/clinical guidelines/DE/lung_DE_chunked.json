The classification of DME with sufficient evidence for lung cancer was made with the indication that the number of epidemiological studies evaluated a load of no longer time-sensitive DME exhaust gases. These particles can penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract. They have a large surface area to which organic substances can be easily adsorbed. Most studies and all meta-analyses show an increased risk of lung cancer in people who have been occupationally exposed to diesel exhaust gases. In these studies, activity in occupations with exposure to Diesel exhaust gasses was associated with an increased lung cancer risk, but as a measure of exposure, only the occupational designation and the duration of workplace activity were available in most studies. Therefore, a quantification of the lung cancer risks in terms of the concentration of diesel noise is not possible. The trade name asbestos is a combination of various silicate fibrous minerals.

This additional cancer risk, as well as the genetic risk generated by ionising radiation, is referred to as the stochastic radiation effect. Based on the linear non-threshold hypothesis, the first principle of radiation protection is the so-called ALARA principle (As Low As Reasonably Achievable), i.e. the objective of keeping any radiation exposure as low as reasonably achievable.

Isothiocyanates are metabolites of glucosinolates found in high concentrations in cruciferous plants. Similarly to this vegetable, the risk of lung cancer was lower with increased intake or increased urine levels of isothiocyaniates [118], [119], [120]. There is also ample evidence that flavonoids, especially quercetin, can similarly lead to a reduction in lung cancer rates [121], [122], and [123] (Evidence 3a). Flavonides are found in epithelial cells such as apples, onions, celery, beets, tea leaves, but were not protective against lung cancer [1242]. On the other hand, garlic was not protective against lung cancer [124]. Therefore, it can be assumed that organic sulphur, which is present in high concentrations in onions but also in garlic, is not responsible for the protective effect [122].

Large prospective studies allowing a re-evaluation of sputum cytology on the basis of these techniques as a screening procedure are still pending. Endoscopic procedure In the case of clinical suspicion of a lung cancer or in case of suspicious findings in the non-invasive methods, a bronchoscope is usually performed. While classical white light broncoscopy detects well manifested endobronchial tumors, it occasionally overlooks early changes in the mucous membrane level (dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, early invasive carcinomas). The sensitivity of the white light microscopy is not optimal for early cancer. The so-called sputum band autoimmunity can be significantly improved by the development of new techniques such as autoimmune tissues/tissue cytoplasm or endoscopy.[199] Recommendations for the use of bronchoscopy as part of the primary diagnosis of lung cancer can be found in the chapter Diagnostics.Tumor markers Schneider et al.

Assuming a realistic screening population in which the point prevalence of lung cancer is realistically no more than 2%, under analogous boundary conditions, with a 75-percent underlying sensitiveness and a 95-per-cent specificity, the positive predicative value would be only 23%, and the negative at 99%. Since a positive prognostic value of 23% for a large-scale screening is far too common (namely, 77%, in the case of suspicious cases) in combination with a later unproven tumour, it would be inappropriate for screening via other methods, such as molecular blood screening alone, and would be unsuitable for the development of large tumours.

Stronger consensus The better soft tissue contrast makes both MRI and CT sonography fundamentally superior in depicting tumour filtration in adjacent structures. Due to the methodological difficulties of representing mediastinal structures, sonography is suited primarily for the assessment of tumour infiltration in the thoracic wall. MRI may be used against the mediastinum filtration of the tumour, the spinous cells in the Thoracic cavity, as well as the atherosclerotic cells, which are particularly sensitive to a question of mediastine filtration. Clinical studies on the diagnostic accuracy of these two methods for assessing the local tumor spread of a lung cancer were not found in a systematic literature search.",

In contrast, mixed-solid clusters with a solid fraction within the milk glass lesion often correspond to a minimally invasive leptocardial adenoma.[328][327] Predictors of malignancy that can be detected at initial diagnosis include older age (≥ 65 years), lung cancer history in general, the size of the mixture, and a natural solid core.[317][320] Additional criteria for the level of solidity are a combination of the size, appearance, or bulk density of the tumor.[317] Level of Evidence 3 [317]. While CT sequencing in a solid core is used to differentiate a malignant lesion from a benign lesion over time, CT sequences in subsolid pulmonary cores are used to identify the optimal timing of an intervention or to completely avoid an intervention that is not helpful in the context of the overall morbidity of the patient.",

In the histological assessment of a neuroendocrine lung tumour (typical carcinoid, atypical carzinoid, small cell cancer, large cell neuroendocrinal cancer), the aim is to confirm the diagnosis immunohistochemically and to determine the proliferation fraction of the tumour tissue immuno-histochemically. Consensus background The recommendation is based on an expert consensus (see Chapter 2.2.4). It is not uncommon that it is necessary to distinguish primary lung cancer from metastases. In addition, due to current therapeutic options also on small cells and cytotoxic preparations, the need for the most accurate possible histological type of non-Small Cell Carcinoma arises. The current WHO Classification of NSCLC (NSCOS) emphasises that it should not be used to further specify the treatment of rare types of cancer. [346] The recommended markers for this are taken from the respective chapters of the current WHO classification (diagnostic algorithm, see Figure in Chapter 6.6.10). In neuroendocrine lung tumours, the WHO Classification [346] calls for the immunohistochemical detection of neuroendocrinal differentiation for the diagnosis of large-cell neuroblastoma.

For all neuroendocrine tumours, the tumour tissue proliferation fraction should also be determined immunohistochemically (Ki67, MiB1) and reported in the report of findings to confirm the diagnosis (e.g. demarcation of artificially altered infiltrates of a typical carcinoid versus small cell carcinoma). This should take into account that the WHO classification of typical and atypical carcinogens continues to define, among other criteria, not on the basis of the proliperation fractions, but by the number of mitoses per 2 mm2. As a result, in small biopsies, there may be the problem that an area of 2 mm2 of tumour care or 10 HPF (high power fields) is not available. A more differential diagnostic demarcation between typical endocrine and carcinogenic tumours is not possible in the absence of evidence of a pathogenic neoplastic neoplasm at the time of diagnosis, or at least 135 days after the diagnosis of this pathological disease. In the case of small cell carcinomas and large cell neuroendocrine cancers of the lung, the immunohistochemically determined proliferation fraction (Ki67, MiB1) is not a diagnostic criterion defined by the WHO classification [346].",

Careful assessment of co-morbidities must be performed preoperatively, as the association of increasing age and operative lethality is due to the broader spectrum of comorbities and not to age alone [371], [372], [370], [373]. As in younger patients, elderly patients also show that lethability is increased when performing a right lung nectomy versus a right lobectomy, particularly in the case of a right plectomy [368] [369] (Evidence 3b) [369]. Perioperative lethality increases at very advanced age (> 80 years) depending on the overall biological status, tumour stage, severity, number of comorbidities and extent of lung resection. The risk of mortality is particularly high after pneumonectomy. A geriatric baseline assessment is indicated if there is a suspicion of the presence of an age-related syndrome (intelligence decline, immobility, instability, incontinence and impairment) [374] [367] (grade 2b of evidence).

These risks are mainly dependent on preoperative cardiopulmonary function and the extent of planned lung resection. If this is a heterogeneous lung emphysema and the tumour to be removed is localized in an emphysematously reconstructed lung valve that can be removed as part of a lung volume reduction, the postoperative incisional function is less likely to be stable than predicted [40]. The decision on this combination of surgical interventions should be made in advance of a clinical trial to optimise the prognosis of intermuscular therapy, including pre-operative diagnosis of lung function [40], and should be carried out in a pre-clinical conference to present evidence for optimal lung function.",

The study situation suggests there must be defined criteria that trigger early palliational care. Symptoms and burdens are identified and treated mainly when patients are interviewed actively, routinely and in a structured manner. For lung cancer patients, the following criteria were established in this working group: any new disease in the metastatic stage and any inoperable recurrence. Here, after the introduction of the defined trigger criteria, positive evidence was shown for a successful earlier integration of palliative care [551]. As a primary trigger for the integration of specialized pallitive care, Ferrell et al identified the following [8]: (1) Surprise question: Would you not be surprised if the patient died within the next 12 months? (answer: No), (2) frequent hospital admissions, (3) inpatient admission due to difficult to control physical or mental symptoms, (4) complex care requirements, (5) weight gain (6) complex social burdens [553].",

In addition, a significant reduction in unnecessary chemotherapy (60 days before the end of life) [533] was demonstrated in one study and a significant improvement in survival time was shown in two studies [504] [544].An additional pillar of integrated early palliative care is the routine involvement of a Palliative Care Practitioner in the tumour conferences. According to the requirements of the German Cancer Society, an interdisciplinary tumor conference should be held in each organ centre at least once every 8.2 week, in which the main treatment partners regularly participate and in which all patients with first manifestation or recurrence of lung cancer must be presented pre-therapeutically.

Both groups had comparable local control at three years (92.6% for central vs. 90.2% for peripheral locations, p = 0.9) In a dose-finding study of the RTOG for central locations the highest dose level (n=33) was reached at 5x12 Gy; this was effective with respect to local control (87.9% after 2 years) and resulted in acceptable dose-limiting toxicity in 7.2% of patients [571]. For such patients, the feasibility of SBRT with attenuated dose regimens at high-volume centers should be evaluated individually.",

Adequate cardiopulmonary reserve is required. Lobotomy including systematic dissection of ipsilateral lymph nodes is the recommended surgical measure. In rare cases, a pneumonectomy is necessary. In certain tumors, a sleeve resection is permissible, as long as an adequate level of overall safety can be ensured with respect to IA. In a randomised multicenter study for stage 1 and stage 2 patients, it was possible to obtain an anatomical survival of ≤60 cm2 in the lobotomy segment [60]. morbidity and lethality were comparable for both forms of resection in these three studies. Based on current data, therefore, anatomical segmental resection is justified only for tumors smaller than or equal to 2 cm and localization in the outer third of the parenchymal mantle with invasively secured N0 and a resection distance from the tumor greater than its intrinsic diameter.

The receptor-ligand interaction results in inhibition of the cytotoxic effector function of T lymphocytes. The first immune checkpoint inhibitor approved for the treatment of lung cancer was the fully humanized anti-PD1 antibody Nivolumab. This PD-1 antibody inhibits PD1-PD1 interaction and activates the immune system against the tumour. This PD-1 antibody inhibits the PD1-PDL1 interaction and activates the immune system against the tumour. In Checkmate 17 [810], Nivolumab was used as second-line therapy for squamous cell carcinoma versus standard 2nd line chemotherapy docetaxel 75 mg/ m2 every 3 weeks in a Phase III study. 272 patients progressing from first-line combination chemotherapies and PS 0.1 were enrolled in the study, the primary endpoint being survival.

This therapy has shown an advantage for all clinically relevant endpoints compared to docetaxel direct. Although no formal study data are available, this recommendation is made due to differences in the toxicity profiles of immunotherapy and chemotherapy, and the fact that patients in the immune checkpoint inhibitor studies received subsequent treatment (40% in the Keynote10 study [1009]; 36% in the Checkmate 17 study [810]).",

After 4 cycles of carboplatin and gemcitabine, there was a switch maintenance (i.e., immediate administration of docetaxel) versus a standard dual-therapy regimen with Docetaxel at progression. There was an improvement in progression-free survival from 2.7 to 5.7 months (p=0.001) but no survival benefit could be demonstrated (12.3 vs.",

In cases where there is a high therapeutic pressure, if the molecular status is unknown, therapy may be started with chemotherapies or chemo-immuncheckpoint inhibitor therapy. Then the question arises of whether to continue chemotheraphy or chemotherapeutics and immuncheckpoint blocker therapy. Generally this question has not yet been examined in studies. A study with erlotinib could not find any difference in the effectiveness of the EGFRTKI for patients receiving Erlotinib in the 1st or 2nd line. Nevertheless, due to better tolerability and tolerance, it is recommended that patients switch to the higher efficacy toxin inhibitor treatment [1122].

The uniform use of ablative procedures under continuation of previous molecular-targeted system therapy has shown in several retrospective studies a Time-to-Next-Treatment benefit (i.e., upward review of system therapy) of 5-10 months, and is consistently associated with pre-exposure to PET/MRI imaging and admission to systemic therapy, which is ideally suited for the diagnosis and treatment of adenocarcinoma.",

Depending on the patient and stage, it should be combined with local measures, e. g. surgery or radiotherapy. There is strong consensus that a central therapeutic measure in all stages of SCLC is the use of combination chemotherapy, which is complemented by local measures depending on the stage. Functionally operable patients in stages I-II should be treated with multimodal therapy, including surgery. In case of inoperability with distant metastasis and radiation-resistant tumour removal, a local radiation treatment should be performed prior to surgery. Furthermore, in all surgically responsive patients, radiation therapy is not suitable for prolonging the survival of the tumour. The accidental diagnosis of a small cell carcinoma with atypical resection of a peripheral round heart leads to the described stage-dependent therapy procedure. General recommendations for the implementation of chemotherapy The implementation of a chemotherapeutic should be initiated immediately after diagnosis, waiting until symptomatic progression is to be avoided [1267]. The following substances have proven activity in small cell lung cancer: cisplatin, carboplatin, etoposide, teniposid, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, vincristine, methotrexate, adricin, epirubicin, paclitaxel, irinotecan, bendosterol, bandoprolol, or a combination of 3 chemotherapies.",

Therefore, the indication for radiation therapy needs to be particularly critically reviewed in the elderly patient. However, with appropriate patient selection, it is possible in principle to perform simultaneous chemo-radiotherapy in elderly patients as analogous to the treatment protocol of younger patients with limited disease. The study by Schild et al. 2005 [1406] has a subgroup analysis for the older patient group in the NCCTG study of hyperfractionated versus conventional fractionated simultaneous radiation chemotherapy. A total of 549 patients aged 20 years and older were enrolled in this study.",

The subjective perception of pain is the result of a complex interaction of external and internal physical, psychological and social factors [1593], [1590]. Pain is a physical symptom whose character and extent can only be assessed by the patient himself. A basic diagnosis for pain analysis is a necessary prerequisite for rational pain therapy.

The structured aftercare plan should identify recurrent, secondary carcinomas, complications and toxicities of the therapy and the need for strong psycho-oncology and social counseling. Consensus based Recommendations 2024 A new structured course of systemic therapy (Stage IVA, Stage IVB) should be developed for every patient. In a retrospective cohort study on the effect of inhaled tobacco smoking on outcome therapy, it was shown that active smokers were 2.7 times more likely to experience pulmonary events four weeks after surgery. The preoperative cessation of smoking reduces the incidence of postoperative complications[76] (Evidence 2).

Furthermore, therapy modification may be necessary in patients due to age and comorbidities. The combination of demographic aging as a shift in the age structure in favour of older people and the increase in individual disease risk with increasing age results in an increasing incidence of age-related chronic diseases in an aging population. Among the most common locations of malignant neoplasms (colon, lung, prostate, mammary), data from the Centre for Cancer Registry Data at the Robert Koch Institute show an increase in new cases between 1999 and 2008. With the increase of age, the highest rates of women showing Lymphoma are increasing, leading to an increase of 39% in the number of new localizations [16]. Clinical trials are mostly conducted on middle-aged patients.",
