Understanding of the molecular biological mechanisms is developing rapidly following the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Progress is being made towards a treatment tailored to the individual gene defects (variants); an EGFR mutation must be treated completely differently depending on which protein alteration (variant) in the EGFR genome it causes (e.g. EGFR exon 19 versus EGFR 20 exon insertion). Due to studies of this disease, the understanding of the disease and the derivation of even more targeted biological treatments will be deepened, increasingly based on the evaluation of the efficacy of new class III drugs in our patient population. The treatment of this group of patients therefore requires close interdisciplinary collaboration between molecular biologists, pathologists and oncologists in understanding the clinical significance of the variants, preferably (if available) on molecular tumor boards (MDT).",

The treatment for oncogene-driven NSCLC is under rapid development and many new drugs are approved annually by the FDA (fast-track) and often subsequently by the EMA. This development should also include Danish patients, which calls for a joint Danish effort and monitoring, in close cooperation with the Medical Council (MR). This guidelines is an attempt to compile and update the new knowledge and approvals within the field, FDA and EMA, within the MR field. Patients with oncogene-driven NSCLC generally have a better prognosis than the other patients with N SCLC. The patient group often has fewer comorbidities and no or sporadic spinal cancers (common for the non-KRAS G12C variant) compared to the other group of patients with the same N ScLC. Oncogene cancers, however, may occur in all patients with spinal adenocarcinoma or should therefore be investigated independently of the broad genomic profile of NSCSCLC. In addition, genomic profiling of tumours from patients with young-age planocellular carcinoma or patients with planucellular cancer combined with sparse or negative smoking history should be considered.",

In asymptomatic systemic progression, treatment with the TKI \"beyond progression\" profile may be considered under closer monitoring of disease progression. Patients with incurable pulmonary adenocarcinoma and NSCLC NOS, as well as selected patients with curable lung planocellular carcinoma, should be provided with a targeted NGS panel containing the variants described in the guideline.

Blood ctDNA circulating tumour DNA The collection of sufficient and repeated tissue samples may be limited in clinical practice. Therefore, a potential solution to these challenges is to test circulating cell-free tumour (tDNA) in plasma as a supplement to tissue profiling. ctDNA analyses can be usefully used when repeated analyses are needed or when tissue biopsies are not possible or appropriate. The interpretation of ctRNA results should be carried out in dialogue with the pathologist and the molecular biologist. Analyses on ct DNA are not fully implemented in Denmark and are therefore not available as standard in several regions. The lack of variants tested on cDNA may not be used to rule out the presence of a variant. Other examples of limitations of the ct-DNA analysis are: 1) the ability to identify mutations and other changes (e.g. pancreatic cancer) and 2) the inability of the NGS to identify all transitional changes. In case of sparse tissue material, where the validity of an NGS analysis would be questionable, immunohistochemical or FISH analysis may be used instead to detect ALK or ROS1 fusion, but in case these are positive, rebioption should be performed for the detection of the fusion partner at the NGS. In addition, it is important to note that gene amplifications and amplification cannot be checked with sufficient certainty if the percentage of tumour material in the tissue is found to be positive.",

A meta-analysis (20) [1a] compared the efficacy and adverse event profiles of erlotinib, gefitinib, and ofatinib. The analysis was based on 8 randomised trials and 82 cohort studies. 3 ALK translocated NSCLC is seen in 4-6% of all patients diagnosed with incurable pulmonary adenocarcinoma (21). The most common fusion partner is EML4 (85%). For ALK-EML4 there are 12 different variants, of which variants 1 and 3 are the most common. The variants are associated with varying sensitivity to ALK TKIs and they develop varying mechanisms of resistance (21). Alectinib and brigatinib are approved by the MR as first-line treatment of ALK Translocated Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma. ALECTINIB Alectinib is a 2nd generation ALK-TKI and was compared to crizotinib in the Phase 3 ALEX study in treatment-naïve patients (22) [1b]. The study showed greater efficacy of alectinib in terms of 12-month events-free rate, 68.4% with alectitinib vs. 48.7% with crisotinib. PFS was 25.7 months for alectininib and 10.4 months for crizatinib. Intracranial response rate was 81% for alectrinib versus 50% for cricotinib . Intracranial response - measured in a small group of patients with measurable brain metastases - was 81% for alectinib and 50% for crizotinib. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were nausea (15.8% with alectitinib versus 49.7% with crisotinib), elevated alanine transaminase levels (33.1% with Alectinib versus 17.1% with crizatinib) and diarrhoea (13.2% with Alecktinib versus 46.4% with crezotinib). The most frequent adverse reactions were diarrhoea (52% with brigatinib and 56% with crizotinib), elevated creatinine kinase (46% with brigitinib and 17% with crisotinib) cough (35% with brigutinib and 20% withcrizotiniB), hypertension (32% with Brigatinib, 8% withcrisotiniB) and nausea, 30% with brigotinib and 58% withcrezotinib). The most frequent adverse reactions during treatment with lorlatinib were hypercholesterolaemia 82.4% (13.9%), third-degree hyperglycaemia 60.7% (13.2%), third degree oedema 51.4% (2.3%), peripheral neuropathy 43.7% (2.4%), and low-grade systemic impairment 23.7% (1.1%).[b] Treatment with rosuvastatin should be based on first-line evidence of the presence or absence of triglycerides or CYP1A4.",

The studies were discontinued prematurely due to their increased toxicity. Therefore, it is not recommended to combine immunotherapies with TKIs. One hundred and two patients were enrolled and the study showed significantly improved PFS in favour of the chemotherapy arm (PFS 1.7 months (nivo) versus 5.6 months (chemo)) independent of PD-L1 status. All patients will eventually develop resistance to ALK TKI (21) [1a]. The mechanisms of resistance are classified according to whether they are due to a change in the ALK gene itself (off-target) or whether they result from a change of tissue-generated signaling pathways independent of ALK (off target) or biological transformation (88) [2b]. In the case of progression to generation 3 ALK-TKI, lorlatinib should be offered with the same reservations as those under EGFR progression, in addition, see recommendation 11. On-target resistance mechanisms occur as both single mutations and as multiple mutations developed simultaneously (compound mutations) in the ALK gene. These acquired mutations are distinct for each ALK TKI, even within the same generation of ALK-TKIs. It may therefore, in selected cases, make sense to switch between the same generational ALKTKI in the context of resistance development (e.g. between brigatinib and alectinib (2nd generation TKI). However, it is essential to perform a new genetic profiling of progressive resistant metastases (alternative cDNA) to map the variants (21, 91) [a, 2b) ] of Lorentinib in order to overcome the frequencies at which ALKTI variants were developed during the 1st generation ALK. On-target resistance mechanisms developed under lorlatinib are often characterised by the presence of several different mutations (compound variants) in the ALK gene (most commonly G1202R + L1196M and G1203R + F1174C/ L), presumably as a result of sequential treatment with ALK-TKI. Multiple off-target resistance mechanisms that activate ALK-independent signaling pathways have been described during ALK TKI. There are case reports describing response by adding crizotinib to continued lorlatinib at acquired MET amplification (21, 89) [1a, 2b]. More studies investigating the effect of combined TKI are on the way. TKI combinations may, pending further evidence, not be recommended outside of clinical trials. Histological transformation Histologic transformation to small cell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinoma has been described under treatment with both lorlat, alectinib, and brigatinib, although it is rarely seen. The histologic transmutation should be treated according to the guidelines for non-oncogene-driven NLC or SCLC.",

These 3 groups of variants rarely occur together, and HER2 overexpression is not associated with ERBB2 amplification. Therefore, there is strong evidence that there are separate molecular biological mechanisms behind the 3 overlapping groups of variant and therefore likely to need to be treated differently (60). Cerebral metastases occur in 47% of patients either at the time of diagnosis (19%) or during the course of treatment (60%). It is therefore important that the development of new therapies is focused on the blood-brain barrier and that patients are screened/ monitored for development of cerebral metastasis. The second study (112) [2b] investigated the effect of HER2 double blocker plus docetaxel in patients with NSCLC HER 2 mutated, line 2.3- and PS 0-2. 45 patients were included and the study showed an ORR of 29%, DOR of 11 months and PFS of 6.8 months than well known for docetaxil monotherapy (ORR of 7-10%) and PPS of 2.3 months.

In the DOLG, there is a difference in the medical council's assessments across the regions. Furthermore, there are differences between the resources of each department to carry out an application process.
