The directive addresses the following topics: diagnosis and treatment palliative care education and communication post-monitoring, aftercare and follow-up care organization and psychosocial care Who is the directive intended for? This directive is intended for all care providers involved in the care of patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. More information about lung cancer can also be found on the website of the patients' association: How did the directive come about? The initiative for this directive comes from the Dutch Association of Physicians for Lung Tuberculosis (NVALT). The directive is modular as part of the cluster Lungoncology. The directive has been prepared by a multidisciplinary committee with representatives from among others lung doctors, surgeons, pathologists, radiotherapists, oncologists, thoracic surgery, nuclear medicine and radiosurgeons and nurses and caregivers.

      "text": "In oligomethastases, local therapy may be added. A proportion of potentially resectable patients are not eligible for surgical treatment due to co-morbidity, limited functional reserve and poor performance status, as the risk of death or permanent disability is considered too high [Damhouse 1996a; Janssen-Heijnen 1998b]. Only small differences in the division of the diagnosis of the disease have arisen due to the progression of the new Classification of Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and several other factors. Pathogenesis Several factors contribute to the development of lung carcinoma. These are smoking [Molina 2008(7) ], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [Collins 2007(6) ], asbestos exposure, air pollution such as fine particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 (PM) or even 2.5 micrometers, and genetic factors [Movina 2008(7), Pleasance 2010(8). Smoking is the most important factor, especially for small cell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinomas. For adenocarcinomas, besides smoking, air contamination is an important contributing factor. According to a large European study, the risk of lung cancer is associated with air pollutions (HR 1.22 95%; BI 1.03-1.45) per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM. This is lower than the risk due to smoking and the overall risk for which male and female smokers are exposed respectively, given the fact that the current risk of smoking is 12,7 and 23,3 respectively. Nevertheless, the overall risk from air pollution is high, considering that everyone is exposed to it. The risks of lung cancer in the Netherlands are 80 to 85% related to smoking and at least 8% to fine particles, especially in adenocarcinomas [WHO 2009; Beelen 2014]. Approximately 10% of smokers develop lung cancer during his or her lifetime. Smoking and non-smoking related lung cancer are distinct diseases with a different course, a different spectrum of DNA mutations; these diseases require different treatments. Eur Respir J 9:97- Baseline question What is the value of screening for lung carcinoma? Recommendation Longcarcinoma screening is recommended in high-risk groups, by centers that have a low-dose CT and specific software. Additionally, knowledge and competencies for screening must be present. Smoking cessation is an integral part of screenings. Considerations There is strong evidence that by better defining the risk profile of a node, additional diagnostics can be limited. Also, there is evidence from the NELSON trial that less follow-up diagnostics are needed than in the NLST trial. That is, the cost-effectiveness of the screening will improve and the radiation load will decrease. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual screening with a low dose CT for the age group of 30 to 80 years - 55 years and smokers who have smoked in the past 15 years. This definition differs only slightly from the inclusion criteria of the NELSON study. Another way to define the risk group comes from the Liverpool Lung Project (LLP). In this model, age, pack years, sex, passive smoking, pneumonia, asbestos exposure and family history are added. When screening smokers, it is important to pay more attention to stopping smoking at the same time. Although a number of scientific societies recommend lung cancer screening in high-risk groups (with non-small cell lung cancer, particularly smokers and ex-smokers who quit smoking ≤ 10 years ago), there are still uncertainties about the value of these recommendations for clinical practice. Participants are positive if the nodule volume is >500mm (diameter about 9.8mm) or the volume doubling time (VDT) < 400 days. These stricter requirements lead to a positive screen result in 485 (6%) of the 7582 participants, followed by a positive result in 200 (2.6%) participants with lung carcinoma. The positive predictive value of the negative screening is 40.6% and 1.2% of all scans are negative. Over a period of more than 5 years after a lung scan, the risk of developing an uncertain outcome is lower than that of a first scan, and the risk is reduced by 48.7% and 5.3% after a screening, respectively. The number of false-positive scans is lower in the NELSON study (1.2%) than in the NLST (23.3%).",

Reference Query What is the place of the FDG-PET in the mediastinum examination? Recommendation Patients with NSCLC who are eligible for intentional curative treatment should first undergo a combined FDGs/CT scan. A separate diagnostic and a separate FDGS/PT scan. If there is a second choice of FDGT, there is no indication for a true skeletal graph above the FGDCT. If FDG-PET-CT has been performed, there is no indication for skeletal scintigraphy and ultrasound of the upper abdomen. Considerations A French cost-effectiveness study demonstrated that, for the anatomical localization of mediastinal lymph nodes, FdG-pet with CT is a cost effective alternative to CT alone (32). Life expectancy has increased by 0.1 years, while the expected cost savings amounted to €61. An American study finds lower costs associated with selective use of Fdg-pet in patients with normal mediastine lymph node and a T1 tumour on CT (33). Other American analyses show that the number of patients with higher median mortality has increased since the introduction of FDg-Pet. There is also a small beneficial effect on survival of patients using CT over the context of the Dutch literature and economic modelling system (34).",

      "text": "Such studies in the Dutch context require a systematic literature review of economic studies and modelling with Dutch data, which is beyond the scope of this Directive. A new modality in the staging of NSCLC is whole body' MRI with diffusion weighting' (MRI-DW). A publication has found sensitivities and specificities in the same order as those of the FDG-PET (35). However, more research is needed to determine the place of this modality for lung cancer. Since in patients with NSCTC there is often an indication for both CT and FDGs-PETS, it is efficient to combine an FDGS-PTS with a CT with diagnostic quality in one session. Whether this is feasible depends on local circumstances, such as the logistics around the access to the FDS-PTs, the availability of an integrated contrast-only access device, the possibility to assess the radiological quality of the CT and the presence of FDGT-CT in the CT, and the possibility of radiological evaluation. Background Conclusions FDG-PET is more sensitive to the detection of mediastinal lymphomas than a methotrexate.",

(16) Application of the FDGS leads to a reduction in the number of redundant thoracotomycots. Due to increasing sensitivity of the detectors, the amount of FDG administered has been reduced in recent years to about 200-400 MBq and the radiation load at this dose is 4-7 mSv. In 2010, almost all FDGs have been replaced by combined PET-CT machines, which perform both a PET and a CT in one session. This is usually done by producing a so-called low-dose CT (cable 1-3mSv) that is used for the required delayed correction of the FDGS-PET images for the detection of anatomical malignancies and can then be administred with an increased level of metabolic activity in the same sex. The literature on FDG-PET in NSCLC is now over 10 years old and consists of a generous amount of systematic literature reviews, meta-analyses, diagnostic accuracy studies, scenario studies and outcome studies (including some new randomised trials).",

When all patients are considered to have an increased sensitivity of the mediastines and mediastins on CT, the chances of metastase are 100%. However, the specificity of the FDG-PET is lower (78%), since infectious glands are also more often enlarged. This leads to a negative predictive value of all mediastinal glands - hence of the N2 status - of about 85%. In summary, the negative prognostic value of the fDG PET-CT for the mediastinum is thus 85-95%. fDg PET for distant metastases In addition to the value for the staging of the mediostinum, the F D G PET is also suitable for the detection of distant mesastases (25). Recent literature confirms the earlier conclusion that the F d G P E T has been found in 10% to 20% of patients with unexpected distant headaches (16). This percentage was found in 350 patients with distant thorax in the city of Lorax (13).

An MRI examination of the brain to rule out brain metastases in patients with obvious therapeutic consequences has certainly been studied in this group (8). Several studies show that there is too little dissemination research in this group, especially when considering combination treatments (8). A skeletal scan is only done when there is a high suspicion of bone metastases (e.g. hypercalcemia), because a bot scan is cheaper than a FDG-PET. An enlarged adrenal gland on standard CT scan is more often benign than malignant. Especially adenomas, due to their high fat content, can give typical images on CT and MRI (obviously by density measurement - without intravenous contrast - and chemical shift-imaging, respectively).

This is not considered to be valid for liver imaging studies where the same pathology is used to verify pathophysiological findings (9). FDG-PET is used to detect (occult) metastases that are easier to approach for pathological verification. No error-negativity has so far been described only for the absence of FdG uptake in an enlarged adrenal gland (95%-BI: 0.95-1.0) (10) (11) (12) (13). Conversely, (slightly) increased uptake may occur in adrenal adenomas, and again the value of a positive test is dependent on the cut-off point (specificity: 0.88; 95% BI: 0.78-0.94) (13). For typing of brain abnormalities, due to the high physiological FdGs uptake into the mammalian brain, FdGPET has no value for direct comparison studies (14). There is not much direct comparative research between schizophrenia and FdPET (15) (16) (17). The literature on hepatic metastases is largely based on experience in colorectal tumours, which, like lung cancer, generally have an adequate affinity for FDG. The data suggest that FD G-PET has no added value in screening for liver metastasis (than with a state of the art' CT) (18) and that slightly increased uptake also occurs in benign abnormalities (19). 2 - Beckles MA, Spiro SG, Colice GL, Rudd RM.",

Baseline question What laboratory test should be done in patients who have indications for lung carcinoma? Recommendation In all patients with indications of lung cancer, a limited laboratory study should be performed on at least hemoglobin, calcium, albumin, sodium, lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase. More extensive laboratory tests are performed to estimate organ functions before proceeding to treatment. Considerations Laboratory studies are not performed for staging purposes, but mainly for differential diagnostic reasons and preparation for treatment as a whole. For logistical reasons, it is impractical to carry out several provisions. For the underlying stages of prognosis of patients with NSCLC, they have some value; however, the provisions of sodium albumin phosphate, NSCL, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate have no value. Level 1: A2 Beckles 2003, (1) Silvestri 1995, (2) Hillers 1994; (4) B Alatas 2002. (5) Literature Summary Laboratory testing is of little value in the diagnosis of lung carcinoma and the determination of possible treatment modalities (1) (2). All available guidance documents indicate that the serum calcium concentration and alkaline phosphatase are important in the detection of skeletal metastases. The sensitivity does not appear to be high: only with extensive skeleton metastasis have elevated values of alkaline phosphate and calcium been observed. This is true for determining measures to detect metastatic lesions in the liver.",

Analysis of published studies on the detection of extrathoracic metastases in patients presumed to have operable non-small cell lung cancer. lung carcinoma - Criteria for medical (in) operability Baseline question What are the criteria that justify medical (In) operable? Recommendation Age In patients aged 70-80 years, the increased operative risk does not appear to be a reason to withhold lung surgery due to age. It is advised that these patients be evaluated for lung surgery according to the recommendations below, with additional attention to comorbidity and general condition. However, caution is warranted with right-sided pneumonectomy. Also in patients over 80 years of age without significant co-morbidities and in good condition, resection should be considered as a treatment modality, if physician and patient consider the operation acceptable. Cardiovascular risk factors Preoperatively by means of an anamnesis, history and ECG examination of cardiac diseases such as coronary artery disease, heart valve disease, and atrial fibrillation should be detected. Physical examination and ECG to detect cardiac diseases such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular disorders and arrhythmias. In the case of planned lung surgery and (suspected) cardiac disease, a cardiologist, intensive care physician or anaesthesiologist should assess the perioperative risk and advise on the peri-operative policy. Pulmonary function examination When the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV) and the diffusion capacity (TLCO) are both > 80% and there is no unexpected dyspnoe d'effort, the operational risk is considered not increased. It is recommended that, if these criteria are not met, the postoperative lung function be calculated using the calculation method (left-can upright surgery and left-can elevated lobe segmental surgery). If operability is doubted on the basis of the lung function examination and/ or the history (unexpected dyspnoe d'effort), a stress test with determination of the maximum oxygen uptake (VO max) is recommended. Other preoperative measures should be taken to decide which maximum degree of parenchymal secretion appears to be functionally appropriate. In patients with an increased operational risk, alternatives such as more restrictive resection or chemo- and/or radiotherapy or stereotactic radiation therapy should be considered in a multidisciplinary discussion against surgery with increased risks. In the case of reduced lung function (FEV and/ or TLCO < 80% of predicted), the predicted postoperative lung function should be calculated using the calculation method (quantitative perfusion can be combined with the segment method). In case of doubt, if the exercise tolerance appears much better or much worse than expected based on lung function tests, or in other situations where an increased risk is suspected, it is recommended to determine an exercise condition with VO max. The theoretical background of this recommendation is that VO max 2 is the physiological value most likely to expose the heart muscle, which is weakest or weakest in lung physiologists. Over 70 years of age, the perioperative risk for lung surgery is increased, especially for pneumonectomy, particularly right-sided. This increase is mainly attributable to increased comorbidity.",

Risk of perioperative morbidity is generally not a reason to abandon lung surgery and is therefore not included in the Non-small cell lung carcinoma questionnaire. The working group considered that recommendations could be made on the basis of these guidelines. C.

For other lung function parameter and for blood gas values at rest or during exertion, there is no or insufficient evidence in the literature for an influence on the operational risk. For other factors that may affect the operative risk such as nutritional status, performance status and other comorbidities, no literature specific to lung surgery was found. For these factors, no attempt was made to make a polarization from the general surgical literature.

Although most studies express VO max in ml/min/kg, it is also advocated that the predicted value of VO max be included in the calculation, as the former would not take into account underweight or overweight, gender and age. It is suggested that a VO max ppo of 35% of the forecast value be used as a limit value. However, the literature is still too limited to draw conclusions. The other practitioner and co-practitioners will have to estimate the perioperational risk on the basis of the above data, conclusions and recommendations together with the other clinical data and the nature of the intended operation. To anticipate unexpected findings per preoperative procedure, it may be necessary to make a more extensive than expected dose of pneumonectomy resection, regardless of whether it appears to be a functionally responsible decision; If the risk is elevated, the team of practitioners should decide whether this risk is considered acceptable, or whether preference should be given to alternatives such as more limited resection or chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy. After explaining the nature and risk of the surgery to the patient, the patient is asked whether he or she agrees with the proposed treatment.",

Baseline question What is the intraoperative assessment of resection type and irresectability by tumor status? Recommendation In operable patients with NSCLC whose growth is limited to one lobe, lobectomy with systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection is the treatment of choice. Patients with such limited lung function that lobectomies are not possible are eligible, when surgery is considered, for segmental resection or possibly resection, if it can completely resect the tumor. Stereotactic radiotherapy should be considered (for argumentation see further in the guideline). If a lung tumor originating from a rib cage has grown into a ribcage, a lobulectomy is performed in principle with a biolectomy surrounding a central lobe, or if a pneumonectomy will be chosen, a lobectomie. In the case of a central tumour, a bilobectomy or pneumonectomy is chosen. If, due to the growth of the tumour up to or beyond the level of the ostium of a bronchus, a conventional lobectomy cannot be performed, a 'sleeve'-lobectomies is recommended if this allows a complete resection, even if the patient's lung function allows a pneumo-nectomy. If this is not possible, a sleeve-pneumonectomy can be carried out immediately on the right side. A left-sleeve pneumonectomy may be performed in 2 tempi.",

If the throughgrowths are centrally located in the tissue, a pneumonectomy is often the treatment of choice. The percentage of resections performed by surgeons varies according to the task group. This strongly suggests that surgery is not always considered as a 'surgical' option. The strategy may be to always start with an extrapleural resection. If free-scale examination shows further expansion, a thoracic wall resection can still be performed. The disadvantage of this procedure is that it often involves a large resection area, which cannot be examined in its entirety with free scope examination. Furthermore, although not everyone considers that this tumor growth prevents the spread of tumor cells, if there is any doubt about the prognosis, it is generally advisable to proceed to perform an extra pleural resections. There is not a lot of explicit literature on these topics. For the decision during the operation, this is of little importance, because in most cases there is no technical problem and these structures can be easily involved in the resection. 5. T4 tumors For all T4 tumours, these are major operations in which the expertise and experience of the operator play an important role and the concept of irresectable is determined by the skill of the surgeon. Often a preoperative assessment of the degree of difficulty is possible. This form of lung surgery should be carried out in a centre. In thoracic or open-heart surgery and in the case of large-scale surgery in the surrounding area, preparation can often be improperly assessed before it can be performed as a resectable examination. Conclusions In patients with T1N0 or T2N0 NSCLC, lobectomy offers the best prognosis and the lowest chance of local recurrence and is therefore the resection of choice in those cases.",

There is evidence that selective application of sub-global resection is equivalent to lobectomy in terms of oncological outcome. A number of factors appear to be independently important for a good outcome; tumour size (< 2 cm), favourable histology (adenocarcinoma in situ, formerly BAC), negative hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, an adequate resection margin of at least 2 cm, and the application of adjuvant therapy.

The vena cava can be easily clamped and reconstruction is performed with a prosthesis or, if a lateral resection has been performed, with primary reconstruction. During the clamping, arterial pressure must be maintained. In aortic regrowth, most of the series consist of patients whose growth is limited to the aorta. Subadventitial resections are then performed. In whole wall regrowths, resection is theoretically possible using cardiopulmonary bypass (55).

      "text": "A microscopic tumour residue at the site of bronchial resection leads to a statistically significantly lower survival rate and a statistical significantly higher chance of recurrence, both locally and at a distance (3) (4) (10) (11) (12) (13). In one of the referenced studies, a positive bronchi-splenic level was an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (p=0.04) (14). In some studies, differences in survival and recurrence rates were found that were not statistically significant, possibly based on insufficient statistics and incomplete data (6). In a large number of studies, an increased risk of bronchopulmonary fistula is described (2) (3) (10) (15) (16). In a study of 13 patients with retinobronchial fistula, the main source of risk was an uncompleted or incomplete tumour (160). The risk of complications from anastomosis in bronchoplastic procedures is also statistically significantly higher in the presence of a positive bronchoscopic level (14). In most studies, based on the above, it is recommended to perform intraoperative free-scale examination of the bronchus resection surface and to extend the resection in case of positive non-small cell lung carcinoma level so that a complete resection can be performed (4) (9) (10) (12) (15) (5). (R0: no tumour tissue remaining in the resective surfaces; R1: tumour microscopic surface remaining; R2: tumour residues remaining on the surface). However, if no open-space examination is performed at the bronchoscope resection site and resection is widened in the event of positive NSCLC level remaining, the probability of a tumour remaining after surgery is increased (1) (3) and subsequent histological resection shows that there is a residual risk of mortality in patients at stage I and II. (12) However, re-intervention is associated with an increased risk of mortality and complications (17).In a peripheral tumour, freeze-scoping is unlikely to be indicated, as tumour expansion beyond the macroscopically detectable tumour boundary is limited to a maximum of 3 cm (2) (18) Depending on the extent of the tumour other resection surfaces may also be eligible for freeze scope examination.Freeze scanning of a lung tumour has been found to be significantly more reliable than peroperative macroscope assessment (21).In a specific prospective study focusing on lung carcinoma, the sensitivity of freeze scan results was 94% with a specificity of 90% (21).Various large series show that the rate of false-positive results in freeze screening is less than 1 cm, and the percentage of false negative results in size-scale screening appears to be less than 2.5 (36) (26) (27) (28) (29) (25) (26) The accuracy of this systematic review has been shown to be approximately 95% (27) (24) (28) or less (25) (22) (28).",

      "text": "In a recent study on the reliability of free-scoping examination of the bronchial resection area, 1.5% false-positive and 1.9% false-negative results were found (20). Free-scooping is a less reliable form of tissue diagnosis compared to routine histological processing (form-fixation and paraffin-embedding). This loss of quality is a result of limited sampling, other processing and time-pressure assessment. Clinical staging does not provide a fully reliable prediction of the presence of mediastinal lymph node metastases. The ultimate status of the N1 and N2 lymph nodes should therefore be determined on the basis of histological examination of the intrapulmonary, hilar and mediastinal lymph vessels removed during surgery. The likelihood of metastasis in a mediastinum lymph site depends on the T-status, the histological type of tumour, the location of the primary tumour and of the mediastine lymph system, as well as the presence and location of metastasism in N1 lymphoid vessels (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34). The standard part of the intraoperative evaluation of N1 status is the dissection of all N1 tumour vessels on which the tumour is located. During pneumonectomy, the intrapulmonary and hillary lymph nodes are preferably removed 'in block' with the resection preparation. Vriescope examination of these lymph node is performed if warranted (indications for extranodal growth or 'bulky disease') and the results have consequences for the intervention. This implies that small-scale non-cellular lung carcinoma examination during surgery should also be available for determining the lymphoid nodes. Intraoperative evaluation of the NSC status by means of lymphocyte clamp-clearance or dissection is also a standard part of the surgical treatment of NSCLC (35). The different options for intraoperative evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes and the definitions of these methods are presented in the table below. In describing and comparing the literature, the definition given in Table 4 and derived from literature is used (36). Despite this variation of intra-operative options in literature the recommendation is to perform a systematic lymph node dissection. In the absence of an intra-surgery evaluation for mediastinals, tumour metastasis positive NSC2-lymphocytes are detected in approximately 10% of patients with NLC, despite the application of modern imaging techniques and diagnostic techniques (intra-surgical palpation). Intraoperative inspection and palpation are not reliable methods for the detection of lymphatic metastases. This was shown, among others, by a study of 95 patients undergoing pulmonary resection due to NSCLC, in which the intraoperative visual and palpatory findings of 287 mediastinal lymph nodes were compared with the histological findings. The sensitivity of examination and Palpation was 71% and the specificity was 94%. In 9 of the 95 patients, the assessment of Lymph node stations was error-negative (39). In a retrospective comparative study with systematic mediastinal lymph node-sampling and complete mediastine lymphocycles, 2.7 times as many (95%-BI: 1.2-6.3) N2-diseases were diagnosed than with abnormal intraoperatively-selected Lymphoblast stations (401). The absence of N1-mediastine infections is evaluated on the basis of the lack of an over-normality of the lymph network.",

In recent years, more has been learned about the site of sampling versus dissection of mediostinal lymphoid nodes. One of the baseline questions addressed this and is shown below.

However, survival is better than in patients with pleural effusion based on carcinomatous pleurisy (50).

A review of the studies is presented in the annex (see Table 5) (46) (47) (52) (48) (49) (51) (50).

Adjuvant immune therapy with or without prior chemotherapies may have no (or hardly noticeable) clinically relevant difference in quality of lives between the groups. Adjunctive immune therapies with adjunctive immune therapy (perioperative therapy) Neoadjunctive immunotherapeial therapy (pembrlizumabe or nivulumabe) with chemo in conjunction with anti-inflammatory therapy may lead to a greater increase in overall survivorship, event free survival/response, and may be superior to neoadjutant chemotherapie alone.

      "text": "Adjuvant immunotherapy may give more side effects. The effect on quality of life is unknown. General considerations The expected benefits are greatest for the neoadjuvant/perioperative use of immunotherapies in combination with chemotherapy. Furthermore, the subgroups with a higher stage and a positive PD-L1 TPS appear to have a greater benefit (see Professional perspective). The added toxicity is not negligible: selection (autoimmune history, etc.) and informing the patient about the risk of occurrence of specific side effects is essential in this context. Current studies with neoadjuvant, perioperative and adjuvant immunotherapy are methodologically very diverse, mainly due to the diversity in the inclusion of patient groups and treatment regimens (number of courses, types of chemotherapy, etc.). The inclusion criteria with respect to patients with EGFR and ALK mutations were variable and there was no clear definition of what constitutes detectable stage III NSCLC. Current studies all use a form of platinum-double chemotherapeutic regimen as control-arm treatment for patients with stage II, IBIC N SCLC. neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy there is a real risk of patients not undergoing planned surgery due to side effects of the treatment. Several studies show that a significant proportion of patients do not eventually undergo surgery, often due to disease progression or treatment-related complications. A clinically very relevant question is the role of adjuvant immunotherapy after neoadjunctive chemotherapy and surgery. Current studies do not answer this question. There is therefore a need for non-small cell lung carcinoma randomised trials to address this question, partly given the higher cost of the perioperative approach to neoadjutant treatment. Pathological and molecular biomarkers are of great importance for determining the most appropriate ECT. ALFR-K is becoming increasingly important for the diagnosis and treatment of neoplasms and adjuvants prior to surgery. Testing for EGFR and ALK mutations prior to surgery is becoming increasingly important for the alignment of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatments. In patients with an oncogenic driver, the added value of immunotherapy in the (neo) adjunctive setting has not been proven, on the contrary, it may complicate any subsequent treatment with a TKI. The ADAURA and ALINA studies show that these patients may benefit from adjuving a targeted TKI as well. In line with these reasons, the EMA approved the use of neoadjuvant chemo-nivolumab (Checkmate-816) only for patients with PD-L1-positive stage II-III NSCLC. In the context of adjuvant immunotherapies, the IMpower010 study demonstrated that the DFS benefit of adjunctive atezolizumab was higher in patients with positive PDL1-expression in stages II-IIIA, compared to patients at a lower stage or patients who were not selected on the basis of PDL1 expression. This resulted in FDA approval for this specific patient group.",

Das concluded that the cost of QALy/ Y is $46,85 at a cost of at least $150,000 and that supplemental care costs are $460,000. The high cost of treatment should be weighed against the expected quality of survival gain. In 2024, a review of cost estimates of new adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments based on NSCLC incidence in the Netherlands was published (Houda, 2024). Background In the current situation, patients with early-stage NCSC, namely stage I-IIIA, are treated with a preferential resection in case of resectable disease. Post-reservation complementary chemotherapy is discussed with platinum-doublet therapy with the patient in stage II-A (MIA8). With the availability of the perioperative treatment, a number of studies will be available in the near future, in which the results of neo-adjuvante therapy will be known.

Epub 6 Apr 2023 PM ID: 37021770; PMCid: PMc10334222. Baseline question What is the recommended adjunctive treatment for patients who have non-renal cell lung carcinoma (stadium I-III) after complete resection in which a sensitive change (TKI) such as a gene mutation, or amplic recombination has been found? (stage I-III) after complete resection in which a (TKI sensitive) gene change such as a mutation, gene infusion or amplification has been found? Recommendation Consider treatment with osimertinib in patients with an Ex19del or L858R mutation in EGFR at stage IB-IIIA (TNM 8) after curative resection possibly after adjuvant chemotherapy (according to module Adjuvant Chemotherapy at stage IA- IIIA). This study showed clinically relevant benefits: osimertinib may increase 5-year survival (85%) compared to placebo (73%) (Tsuboi, 2023) and may result in significantly longer disease-free survival and improved CNS control. After 24 months, 89% of patients were alive and disease free in the osimertnib group, compared to 52% in the placebo group (Wu, 2022).",

On the other hand, a survival benefit of 87 versus 80% after 5 years is seen. However, differences in stages of disease have not been considered. This gives reason to give chemotherapy according to the advice in module Adjuvant chemotherapies at stage IA-IIIA. This is at the expense of more risk of toxicity. Disadvantages known from the literature Osimertinib results in more toxicity, but this may vary. Some patients may experience paronychia, diarrhea, dry skin, pruritus.",

      "text": "After 2 years, 66.3% of patients in the durvaumab group were still alive versus 55.6% in the placebo group. This is an absolute difference of 10.7% with a hazard ratio of 0.68 (95% BI to 0.85). No clinically relevant differences were found between patients with PD1LIF in the PACIFIK study and patients with PACIFILIF in any of the durbaumab groups. There were no clinically relevant differences in adverse reactions between durvalumab and placebo. The START study found no clinical relevant difference in median survival between tecemotide and control (respectively median survivability 25.8 and 22.4 months), with a HR for death of 0.89 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.03). The STARD study was discontinued prematurely due to the occurrence of encephalitis by Tecemotide in another study in patients with multiple myeloma. These results have not yet been published at the time of writing this guideline. The weight of evidence is average for the outcome measures survival, progression-free survivability, response rate and safety (side effects and toxicity) for comparing durvalumab versus placebo after concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This means that it is likely that durvelumab will result in an increased survival rate, progress-free survival and response rate (follow-up 2 years) after competitive chemotherapeutic and radiation therapy, whereas the side effects were comparable. The average cost per patient is €145,932 for durvalumab and €72,393 for active follow-up. The average incremental cost per person is €73,539 compared to the cost of active follow up. Quality of life The effects of the treatments are expressed in terms of quality of life-adjusted years (QALY) and life-gained years (LYG). The incremental effect for LYG is therefore 2.47. durvalumab is therefore cost-effective. acceptability for other relevant stakeholders There is insufficient knowledge of the outcomes of patients treated with sequential radiotherapy, or with a performance score of 2. furthermore, the Working Group does not foresee any problems regarding acceptabilities for the other relevant interested parties. feasibility and implementation In the Netherlands, all the preconditions are met to adequately implement dur valumab after concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. in the PACIFIC study, a CT scan of the thorax and upper abdomen was required following concurrent chemo-radiation therapy in order to rule out disease progression. as dur va lumab should be started within 6 weeks after the last radiation treatment, it is desirable to interpret the CT scan within 3 weeks and preferably as soon as possible after radiation/trauma therapy to prevent changes in the tumour plumbing into the lung and often causing difficulty in swallowing. Radiotherapy often causes multiple changes in the lungs and in the tumor and/or irradiated glands that are difficult to interpret. Therefore, abnormalities in the thorax are referred to as post-radiotherapy findings until proven otherwise. Additional investigations are only rarely necessary. The CT scan of the chest and upper abdomen is performed with intravenous contrast unless there are contraindications. This CT scan is an additional study that must be performed and for which there must be sufficient capacity in the radiology department. Therefore, supportive therapy during and after concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy should be optimized to maximize the likelihood that patients will return to good overall condition (WHO performance status 0-1) to receive durvalumab. The Working Group therefore considers that this treatment can be recommended. Recommendation-2 Rationale/ Balance between the arguments for and against the intervention Due to the lack of studies with a high strength of evidence and the premature termination of a study, due to the side effects in another indication area, the Working Group considers it too early to recommend tecemotide after concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Background The prognosis of patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has remained unchanged over the last decade.",

In addition, in the non-platelet cell carcinomas, a benefit in terms of progression-free survival has been demonstrated for some combinations of chemo- plus immunotherapy versus chemotherapy alone, in platinum-prexed-pembrolizumab versus platinum replacement therapy and for carboplatin-paclitaxel-vacizumab-metabolism versus carboxymethyl acetate-beta-carboxylate.",

For this reason, the reliability of the use of PD-L1 in the study is limited to the group treated with the atezolizumab combination versus the group receiving the placebo combination. This involved both an overestimation and an underestimation of the actual degree of PD-L1 expression. A proportion of patients in the subgroup with a negative tumor in the biopsies will therefore be more likely to have a tumor with some degree of their PD- L1 expression in reality. In addition, there is thought to be more benefit from the combination of treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy than from other predictive markers. Thus, it is arguable that all patients receiving first-line therapy as therapy do not benefit more from a second-line form of cancer therapy; hence, no more potential benefits are expected from the second line therapy (Lazzeri, 2017). For squamous cell NSCLC with a PD-L1 TPS < 1%, at the time of cutoff of the literature search for this guideline, there was no evidence for a clinical added value of adding immunotherapy in any form to standard chemotherapy treatment. Also here, the results of the keynote study 407 (Paz-Ares, 2018) could no longer be included in the systematic analysis.",

However, the exact price level is not fixed in close proximity because these drugs are initially considered by the government in isat and are therefore placed only after the exact ratio of the price to the budget of the treatment has been established, but the impact of these drugs cannot be determined from the point of view of public policy and budget. However, from a medical, political and social point of view, the current price level is considered acceptable in relation to the effectiveness of the treatment.",

      "text": "A lower price of the immunotherapeutics would nevertheless be highly desirable in all respects and, in the opinion of the working group, even necessary, also in view of the upcoming developments and the maintenance of affordability and ensuring a good quality of care in the near future. This opinion is shared by the patient association. An adequate predictive PD-L1 test is necessary for a good choice of the optimal treatment. The cost of this test is significantly higher than diagnostic immunohistochemistry. This test is carried out for non-small cell lung carcinoma in all patients with NSCLC who may be eligible for treatment with immunotherapy. In its totality, a significant cost of the pathological diagnostic budget should be made available for this purpose. In order to optimise the cost-effectiveness of immunotherapeutics in current practice, both the prescription of a fixed dose regardless of body weight and the prolongation of the administration interval have been investigated. In this regard, the pharmacological exposure at a fixed dosage appears to be no less than at a dosage based on body weight, and this may lead to a cost reduction, among others by less waste of medication (Hendrikx, 2017; Freshwater, 2017). Acceptability for the other relevant stakeholders The introduction of immunoterapeutic SCLC in the first-line treatment of NSCLC means that these agents will be provided to larger patient populations. This will have a very beneficial impact on the overall cost of these agents both within the placenta as well as on the total budget of patients with NSCL, and will also have a large impact in the near future on the price level of these drugs, both outside the field of medicine. and developments both within and outside the NSCLC indication area, these agents will have a very large impact on the total pharmaceutical budget in the near future.",

      "text": "The working group expects that there will inevitably have to be a societal discussion about what price level is socially morally justifiable and the ethical consequences that arise from this. There are currently additional quality criteria for prescribing immunotherapy. These criteria also serve to guarantee the quality of care when using these medicines. This guarantee takes place, among other things, by organizing the care within a central (regional) network, in which at least 1 immunotherapeutic centre is represented. From the perspective of the patients, it is necessary to create more centers of care where immunotherapies can be given for the first line treatment of NCSLC, so that the capacity to treat all patients will not increase in the existing capacity. feasibility and implementation For the implementation of immunotherapy in the first-line treatment of NSCLC, short-term expansion of treatment capacity at all levels is a requirement. This applies a fortiori when the indication areas are expanded, as is expected to happen in the short term. When this cannot be achieved, the accessibility/availability of care for patients with NSCLL is essential. This is also an essential moment for improving the current level of care within hospitals and healthcare organisations, but also at the right time and place. In the longer term, the impact of the cost of immunotherapy and the associated pathological diagnostics in oncology care may impede the implementation of these means in general. It is important that all stakeholders from healthcare, government, patient associations, civil society organisations, health insurers and pharmaceutical companies think about this in a timely manner on a structural and acceptable solution for all parties. The current registration obligations associated with the permission to apply immunotherapeutic treatment may also delay the further implementation of this medication and therefore it is a matter of limiting this burden. Rationale/ balance of the arguments for and against intervention Based on the available randomised data with moderate to low strength of evidence, for specific patient groups with uncurable NSCLC, there is a benefit from treatment with pembrolizumab alone, a combination of platinum-prexed-pembrolizumabe, a carboplatin-paclitaxel-bevacizumab-atezolizumable combination or a combination carboplatin -paclitaxel-pevocizumabe versus platinum double chemotherapy tablets or platinum dual chemotherapeutic tablets combined with pembrombenzumab. This benefit is independent of histological subtype, for which a positive opinion has been issued by the BOM Committee. The combination of platinum-pemetrexed-pembrolizumab has been shown to have a benefit in patients with non-platelet NSCLC in all PD-L1 TPS subgroups, with the greatest benefit in the group with PD- L1TPS ≥ 50%. For the combination of carboplatin-paclitaxel-pembrolizumab, a benefit in overall survival has been demonstrated in patients with squamous cell NSCLC in the subgroups with PD-L1 TPS < 1% and 1-49% and a benefit with respect to progression-free survival for all PD-l1 subgroup, including the PD- L1TPS ≥ 50%. The available data are vulnerable to bias and obtained in a selected group of patients with very good performance, without (symptomatic) brain metastases or active autoimmune disease and in virtually all trials, patients with tumours with an activating EGFR mutation and ALK translocation were excluded.",

Examples of these are KEAP1 and STK11, although the precise value of these is still under investigation and there is no prospective study on these specific commutations. Furthermore, a direct comparison with chemo-immunotherapy has not been made. In the CheckMate 9LA study, most of the benefits of the heavy yet toxic treatment were achieved in the younger patient (at least younger than 75 years) with a history of smoking. The CheckMate 9LA study shows a clinically relevant difference in overall survival in favor of dual immunotherapy with chemotherapy in fit patients with metastatic NSCLC without an EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement.

Toegankelijkheid en nabijheid van goede\nlongoncologische zorg voor patiënten in alle regio’s is belangrijk, zeker voor ouderen en patiënten in minder goede conditie. Kosten (middelenbeslag)\nHet prijsniveau in 2019 laat zien dat immunotherapeutica duurder zijn dan reguliere chemotherapie. Het\nprijsniveau is echter door prijsafspraken met de overheid niet inzichtelijk. Vanuit medisch, politieke en\nmaatschappelijke hoek beschouwd echter is de huidige prijs van de nieuwe middelen acceptabel voor gebruik in de praktijk. Een lagere prijs van de immunotherapeutica zou echter voor de gehele maatschappij wenselijk\nzijn. Ook de patiëntenvereniging deelt deze mening. Op basis van het CieBOM advies is voor de Pembrolizumab in de 2e lijn het advies deze pas in te zetten bij een PD-L1 waarde van 50% of meer. Omdat een predictieve PD-L1 test voor het gebruik van dit middel noodzakelijk is, dienen de kosten hiervoor ook meegenomen te worden. De kosten hiervan zijn beduidend hoger dan diagnostische\nimmuunhistochemie, maar veel lager dan van de immunotherapeutica. Deze test wordt uitgevoerd bij alle\nervoor in aanmerking komende patiënten, dus een grotere groep dan die behandeld worden. Binnen het\n‘geneesmiddelenbudget’ dient een deel gereserveerd worden voor predictieve testen.

Haalbaarheid en implementatie\nBeperkende factoren ten aanzien van de implementatie kunnen ziekenhuiskosten, vergoeding door zorgverzekeraars en verschuivende patiënten stromingen zijn. Tevens is de registratiedruk een belangrijke\nhindernis. Andere kwaliteitscriteria zijn wellicht een mogelijke beperking voor de implementatie, maar om een\nzo hoog mogelijke kwaliteit te kunnen garanderen is borging hiervan in regionale netwerken aan te bevelen.

Onderbouwing\nAchtergrond\nDe tweedelijns behandeling bij het niet kleincellig longcarcinoom is variabel. Het hangt erg af van welk\nmedicament er als eerstelijnsbehandeling is gegeven, het type tumor en de conditie van de patiënt. Ook is\nde verwachting dat er in de tweedelijns behandeling door de snelle nieuwe ontwikkelingen in de toekomst veel innovatie zal zitten. Dit geldt voor patiënten met een performance score tussen de 0 tot 2. Voor minder\nfitte patiënten met een performance 3 tot 4 is de standaard een ondersteunende palliatieve behandeling zonder op de tumor gerichte systeem therapie.

For the EQ-5D VAS, patients rank their overall health status from 0\n(worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable). Reck (2017) found a difference in EQ-5D utility index scores mean change of 0.027 (95% CI -0.047 to 0.100),\nwhich was not a clinically relevant difference. The reported difference of 7.2 (95% CI 0.6 to 13.8) in mean\nchange on the EQ-5D VAS was clinically relevant. Reck (2018) observed improvements in HRQoL with nivolumab but not with docetaxel by the VAS (difference in mean change 5.9; 95% CI 2.2 to 9.7), but this was not a clinically relevant difference. The utility index\nindicated stable health status throughout treatment in both arms (difference in mean change 0.034; 95% CI -\n0.009 to 0.076).",

In the ASCEND-4 study, data about the effect of ceritinib versus chemotherapy on overall survival remained immature at data cutoff. At data cutoff, 48 events occurred in the\nceritinib group and 59 events in the chemotherapy group, representing 42% of the required events for final\nOS analysis. The median overall survival was not reached in the ceritinib group (95% CI 29∙3 to not estimable)\nand was 26∙2 months (22∙8 to not estimable) in the chemotherapy group (HR 0∙73 [95% CI 0∙50–1∙08]; p=0∙056).

NCT01395758 – Gerber (2018) studied patients with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring a KRAS mutation, who received prior chemotherapy, in an open-label, randomized phase 2 trial. The study enrolled patients at 11 medical centers in the United States. In the intervention arm patients\nreceived erlotinib (150 mg orally daily at least 1 hour prior to and at least 2 hours after ingestion of food) in combination with tivantinib (360 mg orally twice daily with meals). In the control arm patients received\ninvestigator’s choice chemotherapy (gemcitabine 1250mg/m2 days 1 and 8 every 21 days, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 day 1 every 21 days, or pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 day 1 every 21 days). The study reported the\nfollowing outcomes: overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), and\nadverse events (AEs).",

      "text": "It is therefore advised that a MTB should have the possibility to request expertise from a bioinformatician, but that formal seating in the MTB is not mandatory. A clinical (molecular) geneticist is unfortunately not necessary in the current MTB either because no molecular mutations can be diagnosed in the present lung tissue tumor. However, it is also not necessary in the current MTB because in the present molecular diagnostics on lung tumour tissue, germline mutations cannot be tested. Since some commercial mutation panels do contain this information and it is possible that molecular results can be obtained with hereditary consequences, the Working Group considers it important that a MTB should have the possibility to request expertise from a clinical (molecular) geneticist in order to arrive at an informed opinion, but this is therefore not mandatory. However, an MTB should be able to request expertise from a medical oncologist, e.g. with regard to specific knowledge about targeted therapy in malignancies other than lung cancer. Since the case studies will concern in particular rare or unknown tumor-specific genetic changes (further elaborated in Which patients contribute to the MTB?), expertise is needed from lung oncologists who work daily with rare mutations. The same applies to the KMBP mutations and lung pathologist. A new development in the prediction of response to targeted treatment for mutations or combinations of mutations in the same protein, with no data available in the literature, and in particular the use of 3D protein binding modules, using computational means of targeted protein structure. calculations of available targeted means using virtual 3D models of mutated protein structures. This new application has recently been tested both in vitro and in vivo (Boonstra, 2017; van Kempen, 2018). The presence of a structural biologist for the purpose of these 3D modelling and affinity calculations is and will increasingly be of added value for certain molecular changes and optimal treatment advice. However, an MTB should have the ability to request expertise from a structured biologist but this expertise is not currently considered necessary for every MTB. The expertise of a pharmacist can sometimes be used for the optimal regulation of medication in compassionate use or off-label use. This person does not need to be present at the MTB as standard, especially since the pharmacist may be involved after the advice of an MTT. This person does not have to be present at the MTB by default, as the pharmacist can mainly be involved after an MTB opinion. All of the above makes the working group believe that in an MTT where a treatment opinion of a lung cancer patient is discussed, at least a lung doctor, a lung pathologist and a KMBP, all three working in a centre of expertise for rare mutations related to the treatment of lung cancer, should be present. Expertise should be available from a geneticist, a medical oncologist, a bioinformatician, a structural biologist and a pharmacist.",

The MTB is responsible for ensuring feedback of the decision to the treating pulmonologist. An opinion should be returned within a reasonable period (7 to 14 days) after asking the question. Which patients to bring to the MTB? Predictive and diagnostic molecular pathology has become an important part of diagnostics of lung cancer patients. As described in module predictive testing of this Directive, among others, there are several current predictive and predictive molecular biomarkers that are known to have a direct consequence on the choice of a targeted therapy for lung cancer (see also Lindeman, 2018; Garinet, 2018). Overall, this concerns only a small number of predictive biomarks that are relatively common (<85%) and are described in the late stage of NSCLC (ECR 12/13; ECFR 13/13). NSCLCs have been described (e.g. EGFR-exon19del, EGFRp.(L858R) and KRAS-codon12/13 mutations). However, a significant proportion of clinically relevant biomarkers have a detection frequency of <5% such as ALK fusions (<3%) and ROS fusions (1%) for which, however, registered therapy is available (Tsao 2016). It is known from several international studies in which a molecular profile has been made of larger series of tumor biopsies of lung cancer patients, that new genetic changes are present in other genes or in active domains of already known predictive markers (including kinases). These studies show that many potential new markers are observed in advanced NSCSCLC in Jordan but with a prevalence rate of <1% in almost all cases (Getsao, 2016; Bararin, 2017; CGGP, 2013; CGARN, 2016). Although this group of biomarkers could be excellent targets for targeted therapy, in most cases there will be insufficient data from clinical trials in the short term given the very small numbers of patients with these rare mutations on the basis of which we could determine a consensus response to any therapy.",

Increasingly individualized options for palliative systemic therapy (chemotherapy, biologically targeted and immunotherapy) in stage IV agents, which were usually not yet available at the time of the studies cited here, could have an impact on no effects and indicate indications for Palliative irradiation. With good performance status, survival is an objective of radiotherapy in addition to symptom reduction. A higher dose (10 x 3 Gy) should then be considered and discussed with the patient (shared decision making). With poor performance status symptom palliation is prominent and short schedules are preferable. Given that most patients with metastatic lung carcinoma are still not aware of their disease, there is often little question about the optimal role of intra-palliative radiation therapy in patients with severe intra-thoracic complaints (such as hip dysplasia, pain, headache, 80% of patients with symptoms). Radiotherapy plays an important role. Symptom relief is obtained in 70-80% of patients with few side effects. Significant toxicity occurs in less than 5% of patients: pneumonitis in 2-3%, nausea and vomiting and severe oesophagitis in fewer than 1%. In more than half of patients, the complaint for which radiotherapy was given remains under control for life. Re-irradiation is often possible for new complaints [2, 1]. The question of this review is whether radiation regimen is preferred to achieve these beneficial palliative outcomes. Conclusions The overall quality of evidence regarding high dose versus low dose radiation therapy is very low. There is very low quality evidence that palliative radiotherapy at a dose of at least 30 Gy leads to a significantly better 1-year survival than a dosage of < 30 Gy. However, this does not apply to the 2 year survival. There is Very Low Quality Evidence that Palliative Radiotherapy with lower doses causes significantly less dysphagia due to radiation oesophagitis than higher-dose palliatives. There can be no conclusive evidence of the quality of the very low-quality evidence available on the basis of the duration of the response to palliate radiation therapy. Three systematic reviews compared radiotherapy regimens with a low dose versus a high dose as palliative treatment for patients with lung cancer [2, 1, 3, corrections: 4, 8]. The most complete reviews are those of Lester et al. (14 randomised studies) and Fairchild et al.13 Randomised trials). Only Fairchill et al carried out a meta-analysis, but the radiotherapeutic dose was very heterogeneous, both in the low dose group (10-40 Gy) and in the high dose group (160 Gy) (Table N7-N1). However, Ma et al. included only studies that compared a dose of < 30 Gy with a dose at least 30 Gy, and therefore best matched the baseline question. Ma et Al.",

The accessibility of lung tumors can sometimes be difficult such that multiple tests or procedures are necessary to obtain sufficient information for the most rational treatment possible. A bad news interview/outcome interview is preferably conducted in person rather than by telephone, digital or via a care robot. A Bad news interview should have a reasonable possibility that a patient will be picked up after a bad news conversation/outcomes interview by, for example, a nursing consultant. It is highly preferable that treatment options are not only discussed during the bad news talk, and no definitive treatment choice is made during this interview. Here if possible another moment is entered. Not every patient has the same health skills and is able to process all the information provided here and it is often possible to fit the complex and emotional content of the diagnosis and treatment into a more detailed and comprehensive level of information.

In addition, it should also be made clear that the pathology diagnosis is important for the treatment and that (especially stage IIIB-IV) molecular diagnostics should generally be waited for. It is therefore preferable to make this as clear as possible and communicate it to the patient. In addition, it is often not clear to patients with Non-small cell lung cancer that further tests need to be awaited when the diagnosis of lung cancer has already been made. Inform the patient about the need for subtyping and additional immunohistochemical staining such as PD-L1 and molecular diagnostics if applicable. An animation is available on the website of Lungkanker Nederland on the subject of tissue examination and passage of time. Occupational exposure to carcinogens is responsible for about 15% of all tumors of the entire respiratory tract in men and for 5% in women. Lung cancer is the most common (Gibson, 2013).",

      "text": "Several chemical substances have been identified that give an increased risk of lung cancer with occupational exposure. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has identified 31 substances, exposures or work processes as category 1 carcinogenic, i.e. these substances are carcinogen for humans (iARC, 2021). For the substances, asbestos, silica, diesel emission, mercury, cadmium, arsenic and cadmiums may have a synergistic effect between exposure to chemicals and lung cancer (Loomis, 2018). Exposure to asbestos is one of the most common work-related causes of lung cancer. It is estimated that in the Netherlands about 400 additional deaths per year from lung cancer are due to exposure to Asbestos and 460 deaths from exposure to other carcinogens at work (Baars, 2005). Since the ban on Asbestus in 1993, Asbestose exposure mainly occurs during demolition work and repairs of various installations. Because in the past different types of asbestosis and asbestoses have been used in the asbestose-processing industry, it is likely that exposure to different kinds of Asbestosis will occur during current work with asbestosing materials. The Health Council (2010) does not distinguish the risk of lung cancers due to various types of exposure (G Council, 2010). The Health Council (2010) makes no distinction in the risk of lung cancer due to exposure to different types of asbestos (Health Council, 2010). When diagnosing lung cancer, it is not yet possible from the medical diagnostic point of view to determine whether lung cancer is caused by exposure to asbestus on the basis of clinical, radiological or histological characteristics. Neither the location of the malignancy in the lungs nor the type of malignancy are distinguishable here. The presence of so-called \"bridge diagnoses\" such as asbestosis and/or the presence of pleural plaques or pleural thickening may support the diagnosis. In particular, the historical occupational health history may need to indicate a possible work-related cause for lung cancer.",

What are the possible outcomes that may be caused by the substance? Considerations No considerations have been described. Background Summary of literature No scientific research has been done on the most appropriate record keeping in patients with NSCLC. However, textbooks indicate what information can be collected and which may be relevant to medical thinking, including the formulation of a differential diagnosis. In addition, information from the patient file can be used for national databases. In the case of a patient with a newly discovered lung carcinoma or a suspicion of it, there is essentially a distinction to be made between data concerning the tumour, such as type and stage. There are also findings concerning the patient himself, indicating, among other things, what treatment he or she can and wants to undergo (functional examination). No scientific data are available on the exact appearance of the dossier, but the above considerations are common in medical training and practice. For elderly patients in particular, it is not clear whether all of the data below should be recorded. Much of the information below may be irrelevant for the individual patient, but most textbooks summarize varying data that are important for the lung cancer patient in general. Anamnese The anamnesis focuses on complaints indicating expansion and metastasis of the tumor, and on data on the operability of the patient. Frequent presentation complaints are cough, chest pain, shortness of breath or haemoptotic shock. In the presence of weight loss, bone pain, swelling, upper abdominal and flanking complaints, and neurological symptoms, additional testing with non-small cell lung carcinoma should be performed. In indications for lung cancer, the main risk factors for developing lung cancer should be reported, and a number of conditions should be calculated to determine the overall status of COPD and the prevalence of the disease (1). Weight loss and a poor 'performance' score are associated with more extensive disease and a worse prognosis (6) (7). Weight loss and a poor 'performance' score are associated with more extensive disease and a worse prognosis (6) (7). The following subjects may be recorded in the medical record: age; gender; symptoms of the tumour (cough, altered coughing pattern, haemoptysis, pain, dyspnoea); symptoms that may indicate swelling of the lymph nodes; symptoms that might indicate metastasis (liver pain, bone pain, headache, neurological symptoms); symptoms which may indicate a paraneoplastic syndrome, and thus indicate the type of carcinoma, or need special treatment (inappropriate ADH secretion, hypercalcemia exacerbated by parathormon activity, hyperosteoarthritis and other physical syndromes); symptoms of a previous weight loss; prognosis of social dysfunction (such as eating disorders) in the last three months; the number of complaints; the duration of the disease.",

Trpanel and small arms. - Role of the nurse Baseline question What is the nurse's role in accompanying the patient during treatment? Recommendation Psychosocial problems should be detected early to optimise the quality of life of patients with NSCLC. Nurses play an important supportive role in this regard. The nursing support during treatment should focus on monitoring and managing emotional and physical problems. Healthcare professionals should be familiar with measuring quality-of-life and be willing to use measurement tools. Regular quality of-life measurements by an oncology nurse or nurse practitioner may provide additional information to determine the choice of treatment. Oncology nurses could pay more attention to mapping quality of living in lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Considerations Involvement and emotional support are part of the basic care provided by medical and nursing staff. This support alleviates problems such as anxiety and depression, improves doctor-patient collaboration and facilitates patient information processing. Attention to emotions and well-being facilitates the processing of the illness and treatment. Nurses can discuss emotional and psychological problems with patients in a low-threshold and adequate manner; however, the above literature describes the concerns (anxiety and grief) in a summary and limited way. Smoking is the biggest risk factor for lung cancer.",

In addition, there are many consequences, for example, where the patient is social and/or dependent. Confrontation with cancer can lead to a sense of crisis and existential meaning for the patient (1). Confronting cancer can lead to an existential crisis. It raises questions about what is meaningful and meaningful to the patient (1).

It consists of the thermometer and the problem test as described in the guideline. Supportive care can have an effect on the emotional and psychological state of the patient, but also on physical symptoms, such as dyspnoea management. The supportive care in Thompson's study focused on helping patients understand their illness, express their feelings about symptoms, diagnosis, and future, and expand self-management (8). Patients may benefit from short-term interventions aimed at managing shortness of breath, nutrition, exercise, increasing feelings of relaxation, and maintaining family/family relationships (9) (10). Ryan describes in her review article the proven effects of behavioral interventions of various physical symptoms in patients with cancer complaints such as pain, discomfort, nausea, and chemotherapy (10).

      "text": "Both interventions show a clinically significant reduction in the severity of symptoms. Remarkably, patients with lung cancer who have more severe side effects withdrew from the automatic telephone contacts, probably because telephone intervention does not sufficiently provide adequate symptom management. Nevertheless, Cox describes that telephone symptom management could be a good complement to outpatient follow-up in patients (12). In a study by Cox, a selected group of 54 patients who visited a lung cancer clinic were asked what kind of follow-up they preferred. A proportion of patients indicated that they were better able to discuss their emotional and psychological problems with a nurse than with the specialist, GP or by telephone. Although work can be an important source of emotional support and financial independence for many cancer patients, many suffer from difficulties in returning to work. A case manager is needed to ensure continuity. (Oncology) nurses, nursing specialists or 'nurse practitioners' can fulfill this role of case manager. They coordinate the logistics around the treatment plan, are the contact person for multidisciplinary teams and/or guide clinical scientific research. Continuity of care may be better provided by nurse than by physician, due to the often smaller group of nurse with fewer changes in team composition. 4 - Sarna L, Brown JK, Cooly ME, Williams RD, Chernecky C, Padilla G, Danao LL.",

For good psychosocial care, adequate referral possibilities should be available to psychosocially oncologically trained care providers such as nursing specialists, (hospital-related) social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists, and/or to specific patient programmes (conversation groups, relaxation teams, rehabilitation programmes, patient associations). Evidence-based studies on the organisation of care have been conducted. The organisation of psychological oncological care in the Netherlands falls within the general healthcare framework and is generally subject to the financial choice of care provider and the financial rules of the organisation involved. Conclusions Physicians and nurses play an important role in psychosocial care for patients, by providing good information about illness and treatment, adequate treatment and signalling of serious problems. Level 3: C Schrameijer 1992 (1) Specialized psycho-social care providers (social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, spiritual carers) have a role to play when the basic psychological care of co-medical providers is inadequate. literature For adequate counselling, good coordination between the different caregivers involved from the time of diagnosis to the time at death is of great importance. Good communication, Non-small cell lung carcinoma multidisciplinary consultation and transfers, both during hospital admission as well as transfers from the second to the first line, are essential in all phases of diagnosis and treatment. Psychosocial oncological care is provided by all professional care providers with whom the patient comes into contact in the oncology treatment process. Many disciplines are involved in the psychosocial care for cancer patients, and their tasks depend on the expertise and place in the care process (1) (2) (3). A counselling model can be used for the organisation of psycho-social care, distinguishing between basic, specialised and professional care. Basic psychosocial counselling The medical practitioners, such as the general physician, pulmonary specialist, oncologist, (cardiothoracic) surgeon, radiotherapist and (oncological) nurse, provide counselling and emotional support during contacts in the context of primary medical care. Tailored information about the illness and treatment and adequate treatment are the pillars of this counselling. The aim of tailored counselling is to help the patient in decision-making, to advise on lifestyle rules and to reassure the patient by removing misunderstandings; this results in better self-care, greater acceptance of the disease and less fear and uncertainty (2). Treatment involves providing information in a clear and respectful manner, paying attention to the patient's treatment strategies and high-risk circumstances, explaining hidden problems and bottlenecks in the patient, and treating or referring the patient at the right time. Specialized psychiatric social care Persistent psychosocial complaints and/or psycho-social dysfunction can result in better self-care, greater acceptance of the illness and less fear and uncertainty (2). When the patient needs general information about lung cancer, referral to the website of the Lung Cancer Information Centre Treating involves informing in an explicit and respec-tive manner, attending to the patients' processing strategies as well as risky circumstances, explicitly identifying hidden issues and bottle-necks, and giving the patient treatment or referral at the appropriate time. This level of care may consist of counselling, psycho-education, psychotherapy and/or medication therapy (2).Responsibility Last reviewed: 22-05-2011 Last authorised: 22/05-2011 For full accountability, evidence tables and any related products, please refer to the Directive Database.References 1 - Schramei Fjer, Brunenberg W.",

      "text": "A publication has found sensitivities and specificities in the same order as those of the FDG-PET (35). However, more research is needed to determine the place of this modality for lung cancer. for both CT and FDG-PET, it is efficient to combine an FdG-TET with a diagnostic-quality CT in one session. Whether this is feasible depends on local conditions, such as the logistics surrounding access to the FD G-T-T, the access times to a CT alone, the quality of the CT present in the Fd G-t-T device, the possibility of contrast administration, and the availability of integrated radiological and nuclear-air medical assessment. Preferably, the F D G- T-T should result in an integrated nuclear-medical-radiological report containing a diagnostic CT. Since imaging precedes invasive diagnostics, good organization with short access times is important. For curated surgery, at least somewhere in the trajectory of an F D T-TT (low-dose CT) should be directed. in intentionally curative surgery, an FDG-PET (with low-dose CT) should be performed at least somewhere along the pathway.

FDG-PET is used to detect (occult) metastases that are easier to approach for pathological verification. No error-negativity has been described so far only for the absence of FdG uptake in an enlarged kidney (95%-BI: 0.95-1.0) (11) (12) (13). Conversely, no (slightly) increased uptake can be prevented in kidney, and here too the value of the test is dependent on a decrease in brain specificity (typical physiological abnormality: 95%) (18). For typing of brain abnormalities, FDG-PET is of no value due to the high physiological FdG uptake in the brain (14).

There is no difference between VATS and open lobectomies with respect to postoperative air leakage, arrhythmias, pneumonias, and mortality. Procedures performed with the VATS showed no differences in locoregional metastases, but possibly a reduced number of distant metastasis (p=0.03) and improved 5-year mortality rates for VATS (P = 0.04). Fourteen studies reported a conversion from VATS to an open procedure of 0 to 15.7%.

In two randomised trials involving 331 and 568 patients, respectively, from the 1970s, who received either a 40 or 50 Gy dose of radiation prior to surgery, survival was not increased in the radiotherapy arms (1) (2). Suboptimal diagnosis was observed with inclusion of patients with small cell lung cancer. Radiotherapy as a postoperative treatment aims to increase locoregional control with improved survival. A meta-analysis showed that post-operative radiotherapy in the subgroup with proven glandular metastases in the mediastinum (pN2) resulted in up to a 35% reduction in the number of relapses (4). Despite the better local control, no demonstrable gain in survival has been demonstrated to date. This may be related to the small patient staff numbers, suboptimal patient selection, the obsolete radiotherapeutic techniques and the absence of chemotherapy. For patients with pN0-1, post-surgery radiation therapy did not result in a gain on complete resection. A retrospective study reports a reduction of the remaining number of local positive recidivists by post-op radiotherapies at a mediastinal level (5). In Sadeghi's study, pN2 or macroscopic residues were randomised between postoperative radiotherapy (split course' 2 x 20 Gy) with or without combination with chemo (CAP) (7).656 The relapse-free survival in the combined treatment arm was significantly better.

A multi-modal approach with concomitant chemoradiotherapy and/or surgery appears to provide the best results based on current data. In patients whose primary sulcus superior tumor appears not to be primarily resectable (clinical stage III), concomitent chemorediotherapy is advised. Subsequent monitoring of response is important. If the tumor has significantly shrunk in size and/ or downstage has been achieved and resection in second instance still appears possible, this should be recommended. Given the complexity, treatment of a sulcus Superior tumor preferably takes place in a centre; see Organisation of care centre.",

The difference between conventional fractionated chemorediotherapy and the two-day regimen was not statistically significant (medan survivorship 17.0 vs. 15.6 months). The acute grade 3-5 non-haematological toxicity was higher in the concurrent chemo-radiotherapy arm than in the sequential arm. Acute oesophagitis ≥ grade 3 was found in up to 18% of patients. High dose cisplatin-containing regimens were more likely to show severe haematological toxicity, nausea, and vomiting compared to other regimen's. It could be concluded that CCRT with monochemotherapy (daily cis platin) resulted in less efficacy and less delay in acute outcomes compared to high dose single- or triple-dose chemotherapy, as demonstrated by a recent review of NSCLC: 187-04-2025 which suggests that there is no clear equivalence for combination with other chemotherapies.",

This is due to many developments and new insights. For example, especially technical developments in the preparation and execution of radiation have led to the radiation being carried out much more accurately [Sonke 2010[50], which makes radiation treatment much better tolerated and results have been improved. A retrospective study from the MD Anderson Cancer Center showed a survival advantage by using 4D-CT plus IMRT [Liao 2010[49]. The availability of better algorithms for calculating the dose in inhomogeneous tissue (extremely important in lung tissue) has allowed the initiation of intensity-modulated radiation (IMRT) [Govaert 2012(48]. A major step forward because this technique sharpens the dose waste beyond the target range, and significantly increases compliance to the target area [Schwartz 2005(51]. This made it possible to safely irradiate larger lung tumors with an effective dose as well.",

This conclusion is also contrary to what has been found in patients with head and neck tumours after surgery. In this patient group, post-operative delay of radiotherapy has been demonstrated to have an adverse effect on the local recurrence rate (17). Psychosocial stress Delay in the diagnostic or therapeutic trajectory causes psychosocial distress in cancer patients.

Psychosocial oncological care is provided by all professional caregivers with whom the patient comes into contact in the oncology treatment process. Many disciplines are involved in psychosocial care for cancer patients, and their duties depend on the expertise and place in the care process (1) (2) (3). The organisation of the counselling service can be based on a treating model that distinguishes between basic, specialised and professional services. The counselling services of mental health care providers, such as primary care physicians, oncologists, surgeons, radiotherapists, provide emotional support and counselling during primary care (cardiothoracic surgery) and radiotherapy at home. and (oncology) nurse, provide guidance and emotional support during contacts in the context of primary medical care. Tailor-made information about the disease and treatment and adequate treatment are the pillars of this guidance. Customized information is about helping the patient with decision-making, advising on lifestyle rules and reassuring by eliminating misunderstandings; this results in better self-care, greater acceptance of the disease, and less fear and uncertainty (2). When the patient needs general information about lung cancer, the website of the Lung Cancer Information Centre (www.longkanker.info) can be referred to. The treatment involves paying attention in a clear and respectful way, informing the patient's coping strategy and risks, identifying hidden problems, and referring the patient explicitly and at the right time (2).",
