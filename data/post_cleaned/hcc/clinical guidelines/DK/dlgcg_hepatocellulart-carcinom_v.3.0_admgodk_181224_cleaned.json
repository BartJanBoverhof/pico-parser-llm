HCC occurs in 70-80% of cases in a cirrhotic liver. Objectives The overall aim of the guideline is to support an evidence-based cancer intervention of high and uniform quality across Denmark. Patient group The most common cause of cirrhosis (about 65%) in Denmark is alcohol consumption (2). The incidence and prevalence of cirrosis is relatively stable, but the underlying causes are changing in these years as alcohol-related cirrhomosis and Hep B+C decline, while fat-related Cirrhomoses have an increasing trend. Diagnosis and treatment of HCC involve physicians from different specialties, including medics with internal hepatological expertise (hereinafter referred to as hepato-implantation surgeons), HP/transplantation surgists, oncologists, radiologists, and interventional pathologists. The hepatologist is therefore the central figure in the management of these patients. At any time, the hepatologist must be able to assess liver function and, on this basis, assess which treatment measures the patient will be able best to tolerate. The hepatologists must be responsible for the treatment of liver disease both before and after cancer therapy. Target group for the use of this guideline This guidelines aims primarily at supporting clinical work and the development of clinical quality, which is why it is the primary target group for clinical health professionals working in the Danish healthcare system.",

The screening involves deciding at what level the risk of HCC should be high enough to trigger screening, what screening test to carry out and how often it should be carried out. Finally, deciding what action an abnormal screen test should trigger. The risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis over a period of 5 years is about 7%. Since some groups of patients with Chronic Hepatitis B have an increased incidence of hepatocell carcinomas (hCC) even without having developed cirrhotic disease, screening for HCC should be performed in patients who have a family history of HCC, Asian patients over 40-50 years of age, and African patients over the age of 25 years.",

      "text": "Radiological diagnosis of HCC in patients with cirrhosis of the liver HCC can be diagnosed with MR with extracellular gadolinium contrast and/ or CT without the need for a biopsy if the typical radiological criteria for HCC are met, i.e. contrast charging in the late arterial contrast phase and washout (washout) in the venous phase and/or late phase (13-17). The most sensitive contrast phases are the arterial phase and the late phase (18), but the portal venous phase is necessary for the assessment of resectability and possible vein thrombosis. In CT and even more so in MRI, other signs may be found to support the diagnosis of HCC: capsule formation, coronary charging, fat content in the tumour, high T2 signal, diffusion restriction or lack of uptake of liver-specific contrast. These signs are not as specific as the typical contrast profile and are not included in the diagnostic algorithm (19-22). When contrast-enhanced ultrasound is not included as a primary modality in the algorithm, it is because intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, which also occurs with greater frequency in cirrhosis patients, can be misdiagnosed as HCC due to gahout contrast-alert washout as opposed to colonoscopy and MRI, where there is no MR (23,24). However, a new, prospective, multicenter study of cirrhosis patients with HCC nodules of 1 to 3 cm comparing CT, MR and contrast ultrasound finds a very high specificity when contrast ultrasonography is used as a supplement to non-inclusive CT or MR. The combination that provides the highest diagnostic certainty is MR followed by contrast ultra-ultrasound (25). However, follow-up at 3-4 month intervals is recommended using the same modality that first documented the presence of nodules. For lesions > 1 cm in diameter, multi-detector CT scan or dynamic MRI should be performed. Figure 1. Algorithms for the examination of small nodes found by screening or other imaging in patients at risk of HCC in cirrhotic liver (MDCT = Multi-Detector CAT scan). Diagnosis of HCD in patients without liver cirrhosis In a normal liver without cirrosis, the likelihood of developing HCC is much lower and the guidelines given cannot be used in these cases. In the normal liver, hypervascular processes with venous hout wasta represent metastases from primarily vascularized mammary tumors, such as carcinomas, renal cell carcinoma or neuroocrine tumors. If a primary tumor with the same vascular profile is not known, a biopsy is necessary to make a histological diagnosis.",

At the same time, the presence of small foci of HCC in these resects typically suggests that these lesions are pre-stages to typical HCC (37, 38, 40). The frequency with which such lesions develop into HCC is typically unknown; in contrast, HCC has well-defined stages and exhibits a distinct histological continuum between the ultradiagnostic and typical margins (24, 40). There is likely to be a continuum between HGDN and HCC rather than two distinct stages. Patients with hepatic nodules who have a non-specific vascular profile and a negative biopsy should continue with close follow-up. There are no data indicating the optimal follow up tactic at this point, but repeat biopsy or follow-ups CT/MR to detect further growth should be considered.

This is a fine distinction that is not always possible to make. An additional concern about fine needle biopsy is the risk of bleeding and seeding. Most studies that demonstrate seeding after needle biopsy do not specify the size of the lesion that was biopsied (42, 43). Morphological characteristics can help in the separation of HGDN from HCC, but the addition of special dyes and immunohistochemical dyes is advised. Special staining for reticulin, whereby loss or alteration of reticulation is seen in HCC markers (44) is known. Additionally, by applying a panel of immune histological markers of Glycoprotein 703, Glutamicin 703, and Vitamins 70 can assist in the differentiation of tumors (such as heat shock) from the tumor (diffusion). All 3 negatives can be seen in 100% of low grade dysplastic nodules (LGDN), 73% of high grade dysoplastic nudules (HGdN) and 3% of early HCC. All 3 positives are seen in less than half of early hCC, but no LGDN/HG DN. At 2 positive markers, regardless of which, using this 3-marker panel, the sensitivity and specificity for detection of Early HCC is seen at 72% and 100% respectively in resectates.

The existence of distant metastases, thrombosis of the venae portae or vena cavae main stem are absolute contraindications to resection or other topical treatment. Liver resection for HCC is accompanied by a perioperative mortality of less than 5% and a morbidity of 30-40%, depending on the patient's liver function. Serious complications such as leukaemia, postoperative softening and gallbladder abscess constitute less than 5%. Note, however, that the incidence of complications and mortality is many times lower at the peripheral end of the tumour than during laparoscopy and should be taken into account, especially in patients who have undergone hepatic ablation in recent years. The 5-year survival after resection for HCC is 35-50% in newer large cohorts (66). The long-term survival for small solitary HCC < 5 cm in diameter is close to 70% (67, 68). The risk of recurrence during the first 5 years after radical resection of HCC, for example, is in the order of 50-80% (69). There is no evidence for adjuvant chemotherapy after liver resection (70). The most effective way of prolonging the survival of patients with re-resection, ablation and/ or transarteriolymbolisation (TACE) is shown to be regressive treatment with regressive re-section and ablation.",

Prognosis is assessed primarily on the basis of the diameter of the largest tumour and the number of tumours in the liver. There must be no extrahepatic tumour. Microinvasion is a very poor prognostic sign and there is some correlation to tumour size and number as well as certain biomarkers; however, there are no reliable, either radiological or biomarker methods to detect microinvision, which is why microbial invasion is not yet included in the selection of liver transplants. However, if one could use multiple criteria to validate the prognosis of patients with micro-transplantation, we will be able to use a better prognosis for those patients with non-AFPs (see below).",
