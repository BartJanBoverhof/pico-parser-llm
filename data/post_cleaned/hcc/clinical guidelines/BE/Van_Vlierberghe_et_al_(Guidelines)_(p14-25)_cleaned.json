Introduction\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary tumour of the liver. Its behaviour is rather peculiar with prognosis made out not only by the tumoural disease but also\nby the severity of the underlying liver disease.\nWorldwide it is a major problem. In the West,however,\nthe prevalence is lower than in developing countries.\nHowever due to a rise in HCV induced liver cirrhosis,\nHCC becomes more prevalent in Belgium. In the\nHepCar registry (a Belgian registry where on a voluntary basis, patients with HCC are reported), 70 patients\n(51 male / 19 female) were reported between January\n2003 and September 2003. Median age was 62 years ±\n12. Underlying liver disease was HCV in 29 patients,\nHBV in 14 patients,alcoholic liver disease in 16 patients and miscellaneous in 12 patients. Diagnosis was made\nby surveillance in 27 patients. There was a clear tendency for incidental diagnosis in patients with alcoholic\nliver disease.\nDue to this changing pattern of HCC in Belgium, a\nBASL working group was founded to discuss and report on guidelines in epidemiology,screening,diagnosis and\ntreatment of HCC. These guidelines are a result of a discussion between the different members of the working\ngroup reflecting data published in literature and taking into account the specific Belgian situation. Expert opinion should be based on scientific studies and on evidence\ncoming from well performed clinical trials. Recommendations contained herein are based on the best avail-\nable data or,when these are lacking,the collective experience of the members of the writing committee.\nAgreement or consensus was not always reached.",

In Belgium, statistics from de\nNational Cancer registry for the 1993-1995 period showed that the annual incidence of cancer classified as\nr ICD 155 (International Classification of Disease – 7th\n- revision) including primary liver, gallbladder and bile\no duct cancers was 4.9/100 000 in men and 5.2/100 000 in\n. women. According to these statistics, the annual inci, dence of HCC is in a range of 2-3 per 100 000 habitants\n. making of Belgium a low-incidence area for HCC. At\n, first glance, it seems therefore not justified to launch e large and costly programs of surveillance for HCC in\ny Belgium. However it is likely that the increase in the\ns incidence of HCC follows the epidemic of hepatitis C y virus infection that occurred in late sixties and early\n± seventies. In the United States, the incidence of histo, logically proven hepatocellular carcinoma increased\ns from 1.4 per 100 000 for the period 1976-1980 to 2.4 per\ne 100 000 for the period 1991-1995 (3).

Prevention of HCC in patients with previously\nacquired risk\nChronic viral carriage is one of the main risk factors for the development of HCC. Effective antiviral treatments have been developed in recent years and this has\nchanged the management of viral infection.\n3.2.1. Treatment in HBV patients and HCC prevention\n3.2.1.1. Treatment with interferon\n3.2.1.1.1. Noncirrhotics\nIn patients with chronic hepatitis B, clearance of the\nHBeAg after treatment with interferon-alpha is associated with improved clinical outcome in terms of survival and development of complications of cirrhosis (7).\nAnother study confirmed these results and showed a reduction of HCC in the responders (8). As most of these\npatients were noncirrhotics at entry of the study,the prophylactic effect of interferon on development of HCC can be explained by prevention of cirrhosis development.\n3.2.1.1.2. Cirrhotics\nSeveral studies have investigated the effect of interferon treatment on development of HCC in patients with already established cirrhosis. A meta-analysis was performed on these studies (9). Interferon seemingly\ndecreased the rate of HCC in all trials,while significant difference was observed in 2 studies. Virologic response\nwas strongly associated with reduced risk for HCC in some studies,indicating that arrest of viral replication is\na critical factor. Subgroup analysis in relation to ethnic\norigin of patients (European, Oriental) showed no preventive effect of interferon on the development of HCC in the European patients. It should be noted that the\nstudies are very heterogeneous and that none of them were randomised controlled trials, so that the results\nshould be interpreted with caution.\n3.2.1.2. Treatment with nucleoside/nucleotide analogues\nUp to now, there are no data published in full paper, on the effect of these antivirals on the prevention of\nHCC in chronic hepatitis B.\n3.2.2. Interferon treatment in HCV patients and HCC\nprevention\n3.2.2.1. Noncirrhotics\nPooling of incidence of HCC in noncirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C from 3 studies showed a lower\no incidence in patients with sustained virologic response e (SVR) than in nonresponders (10-12).\nf\n3.2.2.2. Cirrhotics\nCammà et al.(9) performed a meta-analysis of 3 randomised and 11 nonrandomised studies on hepatitis C\ncirrhosis. In 13 of these studies, interferon reduced the\ny incidence of HCC with a statistical significance in\n10 studies. The effect was more beneficial in patients\nwho achieved a sustained biochemical response. The\ns\noverall result was largely influenced by three Japanese studies. Four European studies failed to document a sig-\ns\nnificant reduction in risk of developing HCC.\nThere are various explanations for the differences in the result of these studies. First, in Japan, the sustained\nvirological response rate (SVR) to interferon monotherapy is higher than observed in Europe or the US.\nSecond,the incidence of HCC is much higher in Japan.\nBoth factors make it easier to show a preventive effect of e\ntherapy. Furthermore, there are important methodologi-\ncal questions. The majority of the studies are retrospecl\ntive and nonrandomised,introducing a bias in the selec.\ntion of patients for therapy. Also,different definitions of\na\nresponse (biochemical, virological) are used. The still\ne\nunanswered question is whether interferon therapy can be beneficial in biochemical responders but virological\nC\nnon responders.\nBecause of potential biases in the published trials, it is premature to advocate the use of interferon as established therapy in HCV infected patients to prevent HCC.\nProspective randomised controlled trials should repro- duce the findings in large numbers of patients before a\nh\ndefinitive conclusion on the long-term effects of inter- feron in HCV cirrhosis can be established.

An interval screening not exceeding\n3months should be recommended when aFP is slightly elevated (34,35).\nLiver US is the most appropriate tool for surveillance of cirrhosis and early detection of small HCC. It is effective in this particular field, it is a non-invasive, non-\nexpensive imaging technique and it is convenient for the patient. Liver US may detect hepatic nodules at a threshold of about 1 cm diameter and, in experienced hands,\nshould detect the vast majority of HCC nodules at a size less than 3 cm in diameter (36). The importance of the\nquality of the US examinations performed by the same, experienced operator has been pointed out by investigators who reported good results (27,37).\n4.4.

Moreover, in some of these\nstudies,when a HCC was detected,survival was not different between untreated and surgically treated patients(38,40). Trends in HCC survival in Europe (41)\nand in US (42) have shown a small improvement comparing the late seventies and early nineties with a 1-year survival improving from 8% to 18% (41) and 14 to 23%\n(42) respectively, but this could be attributed to the\n“lead-time bias” i.e. an artificial survival period corresponding to the interval from the point of detection by\nscreening to the usual point of detection in the absence of screening (106).\nNevertheless, a growing body of evidences strongly suggests that surveillance of patients with cirrhosis for\nthe early detection of HCC could be effective in terms of survival prolongation at least in well selected cases.\nMoreover it seems unlikely that new randomised controlled trials will be put up to solve this issue.\nIn Belgium, surveillance for HCC addresses almost exclusively patients with cirrhosis regardless of the aetiology, patients with chronic hepatitis C with extensive\nfibrosis of F3 stage in the METAVIR classification and\nHbsAg carriers.

Subjects without relevant portal hypertension and normal bilirubin levels achieved a 70% sur-\nvival at 5 years, whereas this decreased to 50% in patients with portal hypertension and to 25% in patients\nwith portal hypertension and abnormal bilirubin levels(61). ‘Ideal’candidates constitute only a minority\nin Western countries.\n8.2. Transplantation\nEarly results of liver transplantation for HCC were poor with 5 year survival rates below 50%, mainly due\nto tumour recurrence (60). This was the result of poor\nselection of patients for transplantation. It is well established that patients with single lesions of less than 5 cm\nor up to 3 lesions less than 3 cm in the absence of vascular invasion, have a low recurrence rate for HCC and the prognosis after transplantation is the same as for a\nsimilar underlying liver disease without HCC (57-59).\nResection of HCC is a viable option, with short term survival rates similar to transplantation (61,62). After\nthree years of follow up, there is a clear advantage for transplantation in terms of tumour free survival (62).\nAt present, the shortage of donors led to extremely long waiting times. Programs in the United States,\nEurope and Belgium face a waiting time of over\n12months. The drop out rate on the waiting list is therefore great. This event is also common in patients listed\nwith HCC. In the United States,the UNOS have adopted\nthe Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) system to allocate grafts according a composite score, which\nincludes bilirubin, prothrombin activity and creatinine levels for non-cancer patients. This model answers to the\nprinciple: sickest patient first. However patients with\nHCC frequently have a rather good liver function and a low MELD score. To avoid undesirable long waiting list\ntime in HCC patients a variable score between 24 and\n29points was given to these patients (63).\nLiving donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has emerged as a feasible alternative to cadaveric transplantation. Decision analyses have shown that LDLT is cost-\neffective for early HCC in comparison to cadaveric transplantation when waiting time exceed 7 months (64).\nHowever,the absence of donor constraints is counteracted by the fact that the procedure is associated with a 0.5%\nmortality rate of the donor,and around 20% morbidity.\nh The standard criteria (1 lesion less than 5 cm,\n3lesions each less than 3 cm) have recently been questioned with similar survival rates in patients with larger s tumours and even in the presence of intrahepatic portal\nl involvement. In the era of shortage of organs, these\n- ‘expanded criteria’should be considered as unfair until\nr more evidence is present about the long term outcome of\n- these patients. On the contrary,the principle of expandh ed criteria may apply to LDLT,considering the unlimit-\n- ed availability of this procedure as well as the almost\nl non-existent waiting time. A set of new expanded criter ria have been proposed and are expected to achieve 50%\n- 5 year survival rates in patients with either single\n- tumours < 7 cm,3 nodules < 5 cm,5 nodules < 3 cm,or\nn downstaging to conventional criteria after any therapy s lasting more than 6 months (65). However data at this\nn moment are small to conclude these criteria will become y the standard in patients waiting for LDLT.\nThe only proven potentially curative treatment for e HCC remains surgery, either hepatic resection for\ne patients with a HCC in a non-cirrhotic liver or liver r transplantation for patients with a HCC in a cirrhotic\n- liver. Patients with single small HCC (< 5 cm) or up to\nm three lesions should be referred for these treatment\n- modalities. Surgical resection and percutaneous treatd ment modalities in patients with cirrhosis have the dis-\na advantage that the remnant liver remains a premalignant\n. condition with the potential to develop new HCC lesions\nm in this part of the liver.\nr\n• Liver transplantation should be considered in any\nr\npatient with cirrhosis and a small (5cm or less single nodule or up to three lesions of 3 cm or less) HCC.\ny\n• Hepatic resection should be considered as primary\ntherapy in any patient with HCC and a non-cirrhotic r\nliver (including fibrolamellar variant).\n• Resection can be carried out in highly selected\nd\npatients with hepatic cirrhosis and well preserved d\nhepatic function (Child Pugh A). Such surgery carries\nm\na high risk of postoperative decompensation and h\nshould be undertaken in units with expertise in hepate ic resection and management of liver failure.\ne\n• If surgery or transplantation is not possible, percutah\nneous treatment modalities can be used as an alternaa tive.\nt\nd\n9. Percutaneous treatments\ns\n- Percutaneous treatments are considered as minimally\n- invasive procedures that constitute the best medical\n- option for non-surgical HCC. Tumour ablation is\n. achieved by using chemical substances (alcohol, acetic\n- acid),or by modifying the temperature of the neoplastic\n% cells (radiofrequency, microwave, laser, and cryoablation) (45).\nPercutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) achieves complete responses of 70% in HCC < 3 cm, and is consid- ered the gold standard percutaneous treatment (65).\nChild Pugh A patients with complete responses achieve\n5 year survival rates of 50%. Outcome is worse in Child\nB and C patients (66). Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is\nthe most extensively used alternative to PEI, either trough single or multiple cooled-tip electrodes,or single\nelectrode associated with J-hook needles, according to different engines available. It can also be used during\nlaparotomy or during laparascopy. RFA may provide\nmarginal anti-tumoural effects in tumours larger than\n3 cm in diameter where PEI is unable to disrupt the intratumoural septa (45). At present the 5 year survival\nrate estimate from a cohort of 88 patients with tumours smaller than 3.5 cm treated by RFA is 33% (67). A\nrecent randomised controlled trial of 102 patients with cirrhosis and either single HCC 5 cm in diameter or\nsmaller or as many as 3 HCCs each 3 cm or smaller randomly tretad with RFA or PEI showed superiority of\nRFA treatment with respect to local recurrence-free survival rates (68). There is a need for further randomised\ntrials comparing the efficacy of the cheaper PEI versus the more expensive RFA.\nThe assessment of treatment response is important.\nThe EASL panel of experts of HCC proposed a modification of the WHO criteria: 1) assessment of response\nby spiral CT or MRI 4 weeks after treatment, 2) measurements of the diameter refer to the viable tumour\n(identified by the area enhanced during spiral CT), rather than changes in the overall diameter and 3) local\nrecurrences should be defined as treatment failures (43).\n• Percutaneous ethanol injection has been shown to\nproduce necrosis of small HCC. It is best suited to\nperipheral lesions,less than 3 cm in diameter. Radiofrequency ablation may be a good alternative ablative\ntherapy but data are limited.\n• Percutaneous treatment modalities in patients with\ncirrhosis have the disadvantage that the remnant liver remains a premalignant condition with the potential\nto develop new HCC lesions in this part of the liver.",

There is no standard treatment for patients with\nunresectable HCC, despite the availability of many prospective trials during the last 25 years.

There was\na significant benefit of chemoembolization with cisplatin or doxorubicin but none with embolization alone.\nOverall, treatment induced objective responses in 35% of patients (range,16%-61%).\nThe side effects of this chemoembolization procedures include those of the chemotherapeutic agent and the complications of arterial embolization (liver failure,\npain,fever). Serious complications arise in up to 5% of\npatients and there are no studies evaluating quality of life. Portal vein thrombosis is a contra-indication for\nembolization. Patients with well-preserved liver function (Child-Pugh A) and multinodular HCC without vas-\ncular invasion or extrahepatic spread,seem the best target population.\n– Tamoxifen showed no antitumoral effect and no effect on survival,and only low-quality trials suggested\n1-year improvement in survival.\nThere is no available evidence (69) to withhold or to give other palliative interventions and therefore the following interventions should only be offered to the\npatients in the context of well-designed clinical trials:\n– Systemic chemotherapy has been studied in 9\nRCTs (45). The best single agents are doxorubicin and\ncisplatin,with partial responses in 5-15% of cases. Only\n2studies had a no-treatment arm,but showed no survival benefit.\n– A small RCT of subcutaneous octreotide therapy has suggested a survival benefit in HCC. However, a\nsubsequent study of 70 patients treated with long acting octreotide showed no benefit.\n• Chemoembolization (with doxorubicin or cisplatin)\nprolongs life in a subset of patients (preserved liver function) with unresectable HCC in controlled clinical trials .\n• Hormonal therapy with tamoxifen has shown no survival benefit in controlled trials and is not recom-\nmended.\n• Systemic chemotherapy and/or hormonal interventions (e.g. octreotide) should only be offered in the\ncontext of clinical trials.",

Treatment of early hepatocellular carcino- ma in patients on the waiting list for liver trans- plantation Liver transplantation is the therapy of choice for cir- rhotic patients with early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The optimal candidates for liver transplantation (single nodule < 5 cm or up to 3 nodules < 3 cm) achieve a 70% 5-year survival rate, with recurrence rate below 15% (59). The prognosis after transplantation is there- fore the same as for a similar underlying disease without HCC. However,these excellent results were obtained at a time when the average waiting time for liver trans- plantation was less than 6 months. But the tumour dou- bling time in asymptomatic HCC less than 5 cm was estimated to be around 4 months (71). Therefore, the delay between diagnosis and transplantation can allow the tumour to grow to stages that contraindicate trans- plantation. In a time when the shortage of donors has led to longer waiting time (leading programs of transplanta- tion in Europe and in the United States face a waiting time of over 12 months),the results of liver transplanta- tion are expected to be sharply worsened in intention-to- treat analysis. It has been shown that a waiting time longer than six months was associated with a 23% rate of dropout from the waiting list,usually because of pro- gression of HCC (64). The dropout rates for a waiting time of one year were as high as 50%. Several strategies (chemoembolization, ethanol per- cutaneous ablation or radiofrequency ablation) have been proposed to control HCC while awaiting transplan- tation. Living donor liver transplantation which provides the advantage of avoiding a waiting list or resection fol- lowed by salvage cadaveric transplantation have also been proposed. The benefits of these procedures for reducing the dropout rate or for modifying the outcome are unknown as prospective randomized controlled trials are lacking. However, some practical recommendations can be sug- gested, with stratification according to the expected waiting time on the list (parameter mostly influenced by the patient’s Child-Pugh score). and Column_3: If the expected waiting time is over 3 months, percutaneous ethanol injection is probably the best strategy. A decision analysis has shown that percuta- neous ethanol injection increases the probability of being transplanted and confers a survival advantage compared with conservative management, and this, since the start of the waiting period before transplanta- tion (72). On the opposite, the use of RFA, an effective proce- dure to control tumour, is discouraged prior to liver transplantation. There are concerns, indeed, about the risk of tumour seeding (Lvovet recorded as many as 12.5% of needle-track seeding after this procedure), an unacceptable risk in this subset of patients for whom a curative therapy is possible (73). It has to be stressed that in this series seeding occurred always in subcapsu- lar tumours treated with multiple punctures, without tract ablation. Other studies much lower seeding rates, comparable with PEI using a transhepatic approach, avoiding multiple punctures and applying liver and pari- etal tract ablation (68,74,75). Chemoembolization is a common adjuvant treatment for patients on the waiting list. This option contributes to accurate staging of the intrahepatic disease and may achieve extensive tumor necrosis (76-80). The procedure is well tolerated in the majority of this subset of patients waiting for transplantation. Furthermore, it has been shown that the prevalence of hepatic arterial thrombosis, a graft-threatening complication of transplantation, was not increased in patients who underwent hepatic arterial chemoembolization before transplantation (76). It is probably the treatment of choice during the waiting list for patient with Child A cirrhosis when percutaneous injection is not feasible. If the waiting time before transplantation is expected to be shorter than 3 months,the interest of adjuvant ther- apies is probably clinically less relevant. If the waiting list exceeds seven months, a decision analysis has shown that living donor liver transplanta- tion is cost effective compared with cadaveric transplan- tation (66). Decision analysis has also shown that surgical resec- tion while waiting for transplantation for patients with single HCC and well preserved hepatic function pro- vides moderate gains in life expectancy and is cost effec- tive only if the waiting list exceeds one year (72). According to the available data, the following deci- sion tree could be proposed for cirrhotic patients with early HCC. Recommendations There are no randomized trials comparing different treatment options for the HCC patient on the liver trans- plant waiting list. Every transplantation center has dif- ferent habits in the treatment of these patients. No dis- tinct guidelines can be given here. Fig 2 only illustrates a possible approach for these patients.\nBASLguidelines 9: Acta Gastro-Enterologica Belgica,Vol.LXVII,January-March 2004",
