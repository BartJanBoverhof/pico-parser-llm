Cheung (020) 797 88 10 Subject Assessment of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma Dear Mr Klink, In your letter of 6 December 2007, you requested the Health Insurance Council (HIC) to assess whether Nexavar® (sorafenib) is interchangeable with a medicine included in the insured package. If not, you are requested to assess the therapeutic value of this medicine for the indication for which reimbursement has been requested. This medicine is included in Annex 1B of the health insurance regulation and is currently being assessed for the treatment of a new cancer, i. e. This review concerns a new indication, namely the use of sorafenib in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer). You have granted the manufacturer of the medicine Nexavar® an exemption for a pharmaco-economic study. The Pharmaceutical Aid Committee (CFH) of the CVZ has now completed the substantive review. The considerations herein are contained in the CFH Report 08/03 attached as an annex. On the basis of this opinion of CFH and administrative considerations, the CDC has adopted its opinion on Nexavir® (sorafenib) in hepatocell carcinomas. CVZ Opinion The CVZ recommends that you extend the detailed conditions for Nexaver® to Annex 2 of the Health Insurance Regulations. This extension covers a subgroup of patients with hepatotoxicity to sorafenil per year, 164 patients were enrolled in the Netherlands in 1989-2000 (more than one patient per year). Background In the Netherlands, during the period 1989-2000, 1964 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled (an average of 164 patients per year). The 5-year survival rate was 7% and the 1-year survivorship rate was 22%. Page 2 - PAK/28003871 The standard treatment of hepatocellulose carcinomas depends on the stage of the disease. In the early stage of Hepatocellulare Carcinoma, a (intentional) curative treatment in the form of resection, transplantation or ablation is indicated. At the subsequent stage, patients may benefit from locoregional or local palliative treatment. Embolism can be applied in localized disease. At terminal stage, only symptomatic treatment is possible to avoid unnecessary suffering. Therefore, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormonal treatments. - The limited literature available indicates that patients with hepatocellular carcinoma for whom intentional curative treatment or (continuation of) locoregional or local palliative treatment is not possible or considered medically unnecessary (advanced hepatocellulose cancer) had a statistically significantly longer survival if they used sorafenib than if they took placebo. In the preparatory phase of this Opinion, a consultation was held among stakeholders, namely practitioners, patients, health insurers and the manufacturer. No party objected to the restriction of entitlement through further conditions. Regarding the wording of the conditions, some comments were made. On the basis of this response, the term advanced hepatocellular carcinoma has been changed to hepatocelllular cancer. This is possible because the purpose is more clearly indicated in the subsequent text of the condition. The proposal to amend this specification (a curated treatment or a localised or local palliative treatment) to include a general interpretation of a specific treatment (invasive cardiovascular disease) does not cover this term because it does not encompass a specific invasion. Considerations CVS: For the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, a number of non-drug treatments are currently available such as surgical interventions. Nexavar® is the first drug to be registered for this purpose. The CHF has concluded that sorafenib has therapeutic added value for a subgroup of patients with advanced hepatocelluloma in whom intentionally curative treatment or (continuation of) locoregional or local palliative treatment is not possible or is considered not to be medically appropriate. This indication is narrower than the registered indication of Nexaver®. In addition, this treatment is associated with high costs. Pagina 3 - P3800/AKN therefore the opinion of the CVS is to restrict the claim to sorafenig on the basis of the following: Based on the opinion of the Board of Directors, Dr P.C. Hermans, Chairman of the Executive Board, that further conditions are necessary to extend the use of this medicinal product with a therapeutic added value of CFH and management considerations, the CVMP recommends that xavar® be used and the further conditions as follows:",

      "text": "3.a. Scope Epidemiology. Hepatocellular carcinoma is newly diagnosed in an estimated 560,000 people per year, worldwide.1 In the Netherlands, a total of 1964 patients with hepatocellulose cancer were registered in the period 1989-2000 (1964/12 = 164/year).2 The male-female ratio was 2.4:1. In 2000, the standardized incidence was 1.6/100,000 men and 0.3/100,000 women. There was no increase over time. Risk factors in Europe are: hepatitis C (60-70%), alcohol consumption (20%), hepatitis B (10-15%) and other (10%). In a European study covering 1990-1994, the 5-year survival rate for the Netherlands was 7% and the 1-year survivorship rate was 22%.2 Stage classification. Several factors are important for the prognosis and thus for the indication for treatment, including tumour size, degree of tumour spread, liver function (Child-Pugh stage), the general physical condition of the patient (performance status; PS), and symptoms associated with cancer. Different staging classifications are used in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, with no consensus on the preferred staging system. The recommendations in the guideline issued under the auspices of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and with the collaboration of the European association for the study of the liver (2005), are based on the Barcelona-CBC-Cancer-Clinic (Liververver-Liver) System (LCV) (SLCV).3 The recent guidelines from the European National Comprehensive Cancer Network (ECN) are less generous with regard to these factors. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (USA; 2008) is less nuanced regarding the factors mentioned There is no (other) recent European directive. 3.b. Comparative treatment choice The standard treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma depends on the stage of the disease in which they are. There are 3 stages to be distinguished.3 - In the early stage, intentionally curative treatment is indicated in the form of resection, transplantation or ablation. - At the next stage, patients may benefit from locoregional or local palliative treatment (not to be confused with palliate care). 2 groups of patients are distinguished. One is formed by patients with localized disease who have no remaining symptoms, sufficient function and good renal condition; they may be eligible for transarterial vascular embolism. The other group consists of patients presenting with liver tumors, or symptoms, outside the chorionic phase. There are several potential novel therapies. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormonal therapy have not been shown to be effective, which is why they are not recommended as standard therapy outside of clinical trials. - In the terminal phase, only symptomatic treatment is recommended to avoid possible unnecessary suffering. The standard treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in whom initiation of curative treatment or (continuation) of locoregional or local palliative treatment is not possible or considered medically inappropriate ( hepatocell carcinomas) is the best care regimen available, and therefore consists of a review of the EPAR Methodology, published in the peer-reviewed EPAR Best Care Reviews 1 and 3. A literature review was performed using the most recent files from Med-line, Embase and Cochrane on 28 November 2007, using the following search terms: (sorafenib OR Nexavar OR BAY 43-9006), (Carcinoma, Hepatocellular OR HCC).",

      "text": "Positive effects of sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma were found in a Phase II study,4 and in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase III study that has not been published as a paper, but for which data are available in the EPAR1 and a clinical report in the application dossier. The primary outcome measures were radiological and were independently assessed. Of the patients, 2% achieved a partial response, 6% achieved a minor response (reduction of tumour size by 25 to 50%) and 34% had stable disease for at least 16 weeks. The median time to progression was 4.2 months and the median survival was 9.2 months. The phase III study involved 602 patients (87% male; median age: 67 years), of whom 299 were treated with sorafenib and 303 with placebo. The patients had not been previously systemically treated and were not (anymore) eligible for surgical or locoregional treatment, such as surgery, irradiation, (haemoglobin) embolization or ethane injection. Treatment was continued until symptomatic radiological progression or disease was observed, until severe disease was diagnosed or the patient' s survival rate was reduced to 400 mg dd/ day. In the sorafenib group, the median survival was statistically significantly longer; the difference was 83 days or 2.8 months (Table 1). The difference in the other primary outcome measure, the time to symptom progression, was not statistical significant. The first two secondary outcomes were morning time to progression and disease control, with no state of complete or stable disease response reported. Table 1.Randomized Phase III study of sorafenib treatment in adult patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma Study Drug Efficacy: median number of days (95% CI) patients to death* to symptom progression† 100554, sorafenb 400 mg 2 dd 299 324 (286-405) 126 (105-147) in EPAR placebo 303 241 (206-276) 148 (129-192) *Hazard ratio: 0.69 (0.55-0.87); p = 0.00058; α = 0.00777. †Hazards ratio: 1.08 (0.88-1.31); p= 0.77. Discussion The phase III study was terminated prematurely, namely after the second planned interim analysis at the preliminary interim evaluation had exceeded certain threshold values for the difference in the primary survival outcome between malignant and malignant liver function (see table 1). Conclusion From the limited literature available, it appears that patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma had a statistically significantly longer survival when taking sorafenib than when taking placebo. b. interactions 4.1 During treatment of patients with hepatocelluloma in phase III trials with sorafenic acid, the only serious adverse reactions occurred in 52% of patients (p = 54%; p = 0.49% for those who received placebo). The frequency of serious (grade 3/ 4) adverse reactions occurring at least 2% more frequently in the sorafenib group than in the placebo group were: hypertension (4 vs 1%), diarrhoea (11 vs 2%), lymphoedema (3 vs 0%), abdominal pain (9 vs 6%), hand feeding reactions (8 vs 1%). Sorafenib has also been used for renal cell carcinoma. Discussion Undesirable effects that occurred in both the sorafenib and placebo groups may be related to underlying liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. As these may mainly involve fatigue, bleeding and abdominal pain, most of the patients studied had a Child-Pugh stage liver failure, there are limited data on safety and tolerability in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Experience According to the Periodic Safety Update Report for the first half of 2007, 19,086 patients were treated during that period (8740 commercially and 10,346 in clinical trials). 1The term \" adverse reactions\" refers to complaints and symptoms regardless of cause. Clinical pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely with concomitant use of agents that are substrates of CYP3A4 (midazolam, dextromethorphan, omeprazole). It cannot be excluded that sorafenib increases the concentrations of co-administered P-gp substrates (such as digoxin), CYP2B6 (like bupropion, cyclophosphamide, efavirenz, metronidazole), CYP8C2 (like paclitaxel, amodiaquine, repaglinide), or CYP2C9 (like acetoacetylsalicylate). Conclusion: There is an interaction between the concomitant use of sorafenib and inducers of CYP3A4 activity. There are no data on the efficacy and adverse effects of Sorafenib in children and adolescents. 4.f. Ease of use The recommended dose of soferanib is 400 mg (2 tablets of 200 mg) 2 times a day.
