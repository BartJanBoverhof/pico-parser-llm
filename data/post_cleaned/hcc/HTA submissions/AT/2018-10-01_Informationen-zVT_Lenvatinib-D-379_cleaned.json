Ergebnisdarstellung\nQualität der Studien: Siehe Ergebnisteil\nOverall Conclusions for Key Questions 1–3\n• Six RCTs, four nonrandomized comparative studies, 35 case series, and\nthree case reports comprised the body of literature. One RCT was rated\nas good, three were rated as fair and two were rated as poor quality.\n• The body of evidence for RFA compared with PEI/PAI was rated\nmoderate strength to support better overall survival at 3 years for RFA compared with PEI/PAI with a low risk of bias.\n• The body of evidence for RFA compared with PEI/PAI was rated low\nstrength to support increased TTP, improved local control, and a longer\nLOS for RFA compared with PEI/PAI, with a high risk of bias.\n• For all other comparisons, the body of evidence on overall survival,\nquality of life, disease progression, local control, LOS, days of missed work, and adverse events for local hepatic therapy for the treatment HCC\nis insufficient to support the effectiveness of one local hepatic therapy over another, due to the lack of comparative studies.\n• Studies with subgroup analyses were limited to the three studies\nreporting on the comparison of RFA to PEI/PAI. These analyses\nreviewed Child-Pugh class, lesion size, and multifocal disease for their effects on overall survival, but were not pre-specified. Lesion size was\nalso examined by Lin et al 2004 for its effects on cancer-free survival an local recurrence. There is a low strength of evidence to support increase\noverall survival for RFA compared with PEI/PAI in patients with larger lesions with a high risk of bias. The evidence is insufficient to assess the\neffects lesion size on other outcomes of interest in this report and of othe patient subgroups on any outcome of interest in this report.\n• The assessment of applicability of the study findings to clinical practice is\nlimited by the poor characterization of the patient populations (e.g.,\nnumber and size of metastases, performance status) and variations in the delivery of the interventions (e.g., surgical approach and dose and\ndrugs delivered).\nts\nd\nd\nC\nnd\ned\ne\ner\ns\nPeng S et al.,\nAn Updated Meta\nAnalysis of\nRandomized\nControlled Trials\nAssessing the\nEffect of\nSorafenib in\nAdvanced\nHepatocellular\nCarcinoma.\n4. Fazit der Autoren: (…) For the comparison of RFA to PEI/PAI, our\nconclusions suggest that for these patients treatment with RFA confers a survival benefit at 3 years compared with PEI/PAI. In addition, TTP and\nlocal recurrence may be improved in patients treated with RFA compared with PEI/PAI. Patients treated with RFA also seem to have longer LOS\nafter treatment compared with those treated with PEI/PAI. Beyond this\nevidence on the comparative effectiveness of these procedures was insufficient. Subsequent comparisons had only one or no comparative\nstudies on a given treatment comparison. For these comparisons,\nevidence was insufficient for all outcomes; thus, there is no comparative\nevidence base to support decision making. In cases where comparative\nevidence existed, data were judged to be insufficient due to high risk of bias and/or imprecision of estimates.\n1.

In order to be able to answer the key questions, a conceptual presentation of their statements and the international literature guidelines based on them were developed. A second meeting, attended by all the mandate holders of the different professional societies and institutions, clarified the basis on which the key questions should be answered (de-novo research, guideline adaptation or pure expert consensus).Search period: In October 2009 and January 2010, a central and systematic search was carried out for guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, published either in English or German between January 2000 and November 2009. • Validity after review by the LL Secretariat extended until",
