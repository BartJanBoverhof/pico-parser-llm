      "text": "The pharmaceutical company submitted a dossier for the early benefit assessment of the active ingredient sotorasib (Lumykras) on 14 February 2022. For the resolution of 4 August 2022 made by the G-BA in this procedure, a limitation up to 1 July 2023 was pronounced. At the pharmaceutical company's request, this limitation was shortened until 1 February 2023 by the resolution of the G-BA of 5 January 2023. In accordance with Section 4, paragraph 3, No. 5 Ordinance on the Benefit Assessment of Pharmaceuticals (AM-NutzenV) in conjunction with Chapter 5 Section 8, paragraph 1, number 5 VerfO, the procedure for the benefit assessment of the medicinal product Lumykras recommences when the deadline has expired. The pharmaceutical company submitted the final dossier to the G-BA in accordance with Section 4, paragraph 3, number 5 of the Ordinance on the Benefit Assessment of Pharmaceuticals (AM- NutzenV) in conjunction with Chapter 5 Section 8, paragraph 1, number 5 VerfO on 31 January 2023. The G-BA commissioned the IQWiG to carry out the assessment of the dossier. The benefit assessment was published on 2 May 2023 on the G-BA website therefore initiating the written statement procedure. In addition, an oral hearing was held. The G-BA came to a resolution on whether an additional benefit of sotorasib compared to the appropriate comparator therapy could be determined on the basis of the dossier of the pharmaceutical company, the dossier assessment prepared by the IQWiG and the statements submitted in the written statement and oral hearing procedure. In order to determine the extent of the additional benefit, the G-BA has evaluated the data justifying the finding of an additional benefit on the basis of their therapeutic relevance (qualitative), in accordance with the criteria laid down in Chapter 5 Section 5, paragraph 7 VerfO. The methodology proposed by the IQWiG in accordance with the General Methods 1 was not used in the benefit assessment of sotorasib. In the light of the above, and taking into account the statements received and the oral hearing, the G-BA has come to the following assessment: 2.1 Additional benefit of the medicinal product in relation to the appropriate comparator therapy 2.1.1 Approved therapeutic indication of Sotorasib (Lumykras) in accordance with the product information Lumykras as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS G12C mutation and who have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy.

      "text": "The appropriate comparator therapy was determined as follows: 1 General Methods, version 6.1 from 24.01.2022. Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG), Cologne. b) Adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS p.G12C mutat after first-line therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy Appropriate comparator therapy for sotorasib as monotherapy: − Docetaxel (only for patients with PD-L1 negative tumours) or − Pemetrexed (only for patients with PD-L1 negative tumours and except in cas predominantly squamous histology) or − Nivolumab or − Pembrolizumab (only for patients with PD-L1 expressing tumours (PD-L1 expr ≥ 1% of tumour cells)) or − Atezolizumab or − Docetaxel in combination with nintedanib (only for patients with PD-L1 negat tumours and adenocarcinoma histology) c) Adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS p.G12C mutati first-line therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with platinum-con chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and pl containing chemotherapy Appropriate comparator therapy for sotorasib as monotherapy: Patient-individual therapy, taking into account previous therapy and histolo selection of afatinib, pemetrexed, erlotinib, docetaxel, docetaxel in combinati ramucirumab, docetaxel in combination with nintedanib and vinorelbine. Criteria according to Chapter 5 Section 6 of the Rules of Procedure of the G-BA: The appropriate comparator therapy must be an appropriate therapy in the ther indication in accordance with the generally recognised state of medical knowledge 12 SGB V), preferably a therapy for which endpoint studies are available and which has its worth in practical application unless contradicted by the guidelines under Sec paragraph 1 SGB V or the principle of economic efficiency. In determining the appropriate comparator therapy, the following criteria, in particula be taken into account as specified in Chapter 5 Section 6, paragraph 3 VerfO: tion ses of ression tive ion after ontaining latinumogy with ion with rapeutic (Section s proven ction 92, ar, must 1. To be considered as a comparator therapy, the medicinal product must, principally, have a marketing authorisation for the therapeutic indication. 2. If a non-medicinal treatment is considered as a comparator therapy, this must be available within the framework of the SHI system. 3. As comparator therapy, medicinal products or non-medicinal treatments for which the patient-relevant benefit has already been determined by the G-BA shall be preferred. 4. According to the generally recognised state of medical knowledge, the comparator therapy should be part of the appropriate therapy in the therapeutic indication. Justification based on the criteria set out in Chapter 5 Section 6, paragraph 3 VerfO: on 1. In terms of authorisation status, the active ingredients cisplatin, docetaxel, etoposide, ifosfamide, mitomycin, paclitaxel, pemetrexed, vindesine, vinorelbine, afatinib, erlotinib, nintedanib, atezolizumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab and ramucirumab are available for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Medicinal products with an explicit marketing authorisation for the treatment of treatable mutations or for molecularly stratified therapy (directed against ALK, BRAF, EGFR, Exon-20, METex14, RET or ROS1) are not listed. Apart from sotorasib, there are currently no other approved medicinal therapies that are explicitly used in adults with a KRAS p.G12C mutation. on 2. For the present therapeutic indication, it is assumed that the patients have no indication for definitive local therapy. Therefore, a non-medicinal treatment cannot be considered in the present therapeutic indication. on 3. For pretreated advanced NSCLC, resolutions of the G-BA on the benefit assessment of medicinal products with new active ingredients according to Section 35a SGB V on the active ingredients afatinib, atezolizumab, nintedanib, nivolumab, pembrolizumab and ramucirumab are available. Medicinal products with an explicit marketing authorisation for the treatment of treatable mutations or for molecularly stratified therapy (directed against ALK, BRAF, EGFR, Exon-20, METex14, RET or ROS1) are not listed. Annex VI to Section K of the Pharmaceuticals Directive - Prescribability of approved medicinal products in non-approved therapeutic indications (off-label use): Carboplatin-containing medicinal products for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) - combination therapy on 4. The generally recognised state of medical knowledge was illustrated by a systematic search for guidelines as well as reviews of clinical studies in the present indication and is presented in the \"Research and synopsis of the evidence to determine the appropriate comparator therapy according to Section 35a SGB V\". The scientific-medical societies and the Drugs Commission of the German Medical Association (AkdÄ) were also involved in writing on questions relating to the comparator therapy in the present indication according to Section 35a, paragraph 7 SGB V. Among the approved active ingredients listed under 1., only certain active ingredients will be included in the appropriate comparator therapy, taking into account the evidence on therapeutic benefit, the guideline recommendations and the reality of health care provision. At this time, it is assumed that no other molecularly stratified therapy (directed against ALK, BRAF, EGFR, exon-20, METex14, RET or ROS1) will be considered for patients at the time of therapy with sotorasib. It should be noted that there is no higher quality evidence for the treatment of NSCLC related to the KRAS p.G12C mutation. So far, there are no other approved medicinal treatments besides sotorasib that are explicitly used in the presence of a KRAS p.G12C mutation according to the marketing authorisation. According to the scientific-medical societies involved and the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), the treatment standards correspond to those of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer without specifically treatable oncogenic driver mutations. For the present therapeutic indication, it is also assumed that the patients are generally eligible for active antineoplastic therapy, which is why best supportive care is not considered as an appropriate comparator therapy in the present case. In the second-line treatment, depending on the first-line therapy, a distinction is made between a) patients with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody monotherapy pretreatment, b) patients with cytotoxic chemotherapy pretreatment and c) after first-line therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with a platinum-containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and a platinum-containing chemotherapy as pretreatment. In the present procedure, patients with cytotoxic chemotherapy pretreatment (patient group b) and patients after first-line therapy with an anti-PD- 1/PD-L1 in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and platinum-containing chemotherapy (patient group c) are relevant. b) Following first-line therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy For patients with NSCLC for whom further antineoplastic therapy is indicated after firstline chemotherapy, several treatment options are available on the basis of the available evidence with the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents docetaxel and pemetrexed, in each case as monotherapy, docetaxel in combination with nintedanib and the immune checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, partly only under certain conditions. With docetaxel and pemetrexed, both as monotherapy, two established chemotherapeutic agents are available for second-line chemotherapy, although pemetrexed is unsuitable for predominantly squamous histology. For the combination of docetaxel and nintedanib, which is indicated for adenocarcinoma histology, an indication of a minor additional benefit was identified in the benefit assessment compared to docetaxel monotherapy (resolution of 18 June 2015). In the guidelines, docetaxel in combination with nintedanib is recommended alongside the other chemotherapy options, but is not regularly preferred over them. Based on the available evidence and corresponding therapy recommendations in the guidelines, docetaxel and pemetrexed, each as monotherapy, as well as docetaxel in combination with nintedanib, are considered therapeutically comparable, subject to tumour histology and the different side effect profile. For nivolumab for the treatment of adults after prior chemotherapy and squamous tumour histology, an indication of a major additional benefit was identified in the benefit assessment compared to docetaxel (resolution of 4 February 2016). For nivolumab for the treatment of adults after prior chemotherapy and non-squamous tumour histology, an indication of a major additional benefit was also identified in the benefit assessment compared to docetaxel (resolution of 20 October 2016). For pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, used after prior chemotherapy, the benefit assessment also found an indication of a major additional benefit compared to docetaxel (pembrolizumab: resolution of 2 February 2017, atezolizumab: resolution of 16 March 2018). According to the marketing authorisation for the present therapeutic indication, pembrolizumab is only indicated for patients with PD-L1 expressing tumours (TPS ≥ 1%). Nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab each lead to a significant prolongation in overall survival compared with docetaxel and also to a significant reduction in side effects. Accordingly, the guidelines regularly prefer immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. However, PD-L1 negative tumours are a fundamental exception. In these cases, the guidelines predominantly do not recommend a regular preference of immune checkpoint inhibitors over cytotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, in PD-L1 negative tumours, alternative cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are also determined as an appropriate comparator therapy for the immune checkpoint inhibitors. For ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel, no additional benefit was shown in the benefit assessment compared to docetaxel (resolution of 1 September 2016). Likewise, no additional benefit was identified in the benefit assessment of afatinib compared to docetaxel (resolution of 20 October 2016). Taking into account that benefit-assessed medicinal treatments with an additional benefit are available in the present indication, the treatment options ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel as well as afatinib, for which no additional benefit could be determined in each case, are not considered as an appropriate comparator therapy. In the overall assessment, the G-BA determined docetaxel, pemetrexed, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab and docetaxel in combination with nintedanib as equally appropriate comparator therapies for this patient group. The additional benefit can be demonstrated compared to one of the treatment options mentioned. The appropriate comparator therapy determined here includes several therapeutic alternatives. In this context, individual therapeutic alternatives only represent a comparator therapy for the part of the patient population that has the patient and disease characteristics specified in brackets. The therapeutic alternatives are only to be considered equally appropriate in the therapeutic indication, where the patient populations have the same characteristics. c) Following first-line therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with a platinum-containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti-PD- 1/PD-L1 and a platinum-containing chemotherapy Th tre The treatment setting addressed in the present case may include patients who have either already received a platinum-containing chemotherapy in combination with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy as part of first-line therapy or have received a platinumcontaining chemotherapy and an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy sequentially in the first and second line of therapy (regardless of which of the therapies was administered first). For both the treatment setting after platinum-containing chemotherapy in combination with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and for further treatment after sequential therapy with a platinum-containing chemotherapy and an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in the first and second line of therapy, there is no higher-quality evidence based on clinical studies. According to the guidelines, patients in the present therapeutic indication are eligible for antineoplastic subsequent therapy, taking into account the prior therapy and tumour histology, with docetaxel, pemetrexed, docetaxel in combination with ramucirumab or nintedanib, erlotinib and afatinib being named as treatment options. The recommendation of further therapy with a (different) anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 does not emerge from the available evidence. For the combination of docetaxel and nintedanib, which is indicated for adenocarcinoma histology, an indication of a minor additional benefit was identified in the benefit assessment compared to docetaxel monotherapy (resolution of 18 June For ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel, no additional benefit was shown in the benefit assessment compared to docetaxel (resolution of 1 September 2016). The benefit assessment showed no additional benefit for afatinib for the treatment of adults with squamous cell histology compared to the appropriate comparator therapy docetaxel (resolution of 20 October 2016). With regard to the above-mentioned benefit assessments, however, it should be noted that they were based on the treatment setting of a second-line therapy after prior platinum-containing chemotherapy and thus, on an indication that deviated from the present treatment setting with regard to the prior therapy. Overall, in view of the limited evidence for the present treatment setting, the G-BA determined a patient-individual therapy as the appropriate comparator therapy, taking into account the prior therapy and histology, selecting afatinib, pemetrexed, erlotinib, docetaxel, docetaxel in combination with ramucirumab and docetaxel in combination with nintedanib as well as vinorelbine. The specific appropriate comparator therapy comprises a selection of different active ingredients and combinations of active ingredients that can be considered for the present therapeutic indication according to the authorisation status of the medicinal products and the recommendations in the guidelines. he findings in Annex XII do not restrict the scope of treatment required to fulfil the medical eatment order.",

      "text": "In summary, the additional benefit of sotorasib is assessed as follows: b) Adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS p.G12C mutation after first-line therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy An additional benefit is not proven. Justification: For adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS p.G12C mutation after first-line therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy, the pharmaceutical company does not submit data for the assessment of additional benefit. Therefore, an additional benefit is not proven. c) Adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS p.G12C mutation after first-line therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and platinumcontaining chemotherapy c1) Adults for whom docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy Hint of a non-quantifiable additional benefit. Justification: For the proof of an additional benefit of sotorasib, the pharmaceutical company presents the still ongoing randomised, open-label and multicentre phase III CodeBreak 200 study comparing sotorasib versus docetaxel. The study has been conducted in 148 study sites in Asia, Australia, Europe and North and South America since 2020. The study enrolled adult patients with locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic NSCLC with molecularly diagnosed KRAS G12C mutation. Patients had to have disease progression during or after at least 1 prior systemic therapy for advanced or unresectable stage of the disease. Prior therapy should include combined or sequential platinum-containing combination chemotherapy and an anti-PD-1/PD-L1. A total of 334 (96.8%) patients in the study received prior treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and platinum-containing chemotherapy (in combination or sequentially). For enrolment in the study, patients should have a general condition according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) ≤ 1, no relevant limitations in renal and liver function and no haematological limitations. The total of 345 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either treatment with sotorasib (N = 171) or docetaxel (N = 174), stratified by number of prior lines of therapy in advanced stage of the disease (1 vs 2 vs > 2), descent (Asian vs non-Asian) and brain metastases at the time of randomisation (yes vs no). The treatment with sotorasib or docetaxel complied with the specifications of the product information with restrictions regarding a renewed intake of sotorasib after vomiting or regarding a permitted dose reduction of docetaxel to 55 mg/m2body surface area and, if required, a second dose reduction to 37.5 mg/m2 body surface area during the course of the study. Treatment with study medication continued until disease progression, intolerance of treatment, initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up or death. If certain criteria were met according to the principal investigator's assessment, further treatment with sotorasib or docetaxel was possible even after disease progression. Under certain conditions, e.g. the patients were not allowed to have started any other cancer therapy, a change of therapy from docetaxel to sotorasib was possible at the doctor's discretion. The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival according to a blinded, independent central review. Other patient-relevant endpoints included overall survival and endpoints on symptomatology and health status. In addition, endpoints of the categories health-related quality of life and side effects were collected. The pharmaceutical company presents results of the 1st data cut-off from 02.08.2022. Implementation of the appropriate comparator therapy The CodeBreak 200 study presented is a single-comparator study in which all patients in the comparator arm received docetaxel as monotherapy. Thus, the CodeBreak 200 study does not implement the appropriate comparator therapy, which provides for a patient-individual selection from several named treatment options. In the submitted dossier and in the context of the statement, the pharmaceutical company justifies the choice of docetaxel with advantages over the other options of the appropriate comparator therapy, in particular docetaxel in combination with ramucirumab or docetaxel in combination with nintedanib, and additionally cites the lack of global availability of individual therapy options. Within the framework of the written statement procedure, the scientific-medical societies describe the therapy of pretreated NSCLC with docetaxel as a particularly relevant therapeutic alternative in view of the previous therapy for patients without contraindications. The other therapy options included in the appropriate comparator therapy play a particularly relevant therapeutic alternative. The other therapeutic alternative included in the appropriate comparator therapy also play a role. Even taking into account the statements, the G-BA considers the CodeBreak 200 study as a whole to be a sufficiently suitable evidence base to make an assessment with regard to the sub-population of patients for whom docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy. Consequently, a separate assessment is made for patients for whom docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy (patient group c1)) and patients for whom a therapy other than docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy (patient group c2)). Extent and probability of the additional benefit c1) Adults for whom docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy Hint for a non-quantifiable additional benefit Mortality The endpoint of overall survival was defined in the CodeBreak 200 study as the time from the date of randomisation to death from any cause. There is no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms here. With regard to overall survival, an additional benefit of sotorasib compared to docetaxel is therefore not proven. Morbidity Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined in the study as the time from the date of randomisation until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. For the PFS, there is a statistically significant difference to the advantage of sotorasib compared to docetaxel. The PFS endpoint is a combined endpoint composed of endpoints of the mortality and morbidity categories. The endpoint component of mortality is already assessed via the endpoint of overall survival as an independent endpoint. The morbidity component is assessed according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1) and thus predominantly by means of imaging procedures. Taking into account the aspects mentioned above, there are different opinions within the G-BA regarding the patient-relevance of the endpoint PFS. The overall statement on the extent of the additional benefit remains unaffected. Progression of central nervous system (CNS) metastases The endpoint of progression in the CNS is defined in the CodeBreak 200 study as the time from randomisation to radiological evidence of disease progression in the CNS (endpoint assessment only for patients who already had CNS disease at the time of enrolment in the study). The assessment is based solely on imaging procedures and does not take into account the symptomatology perceived by patients. Thus, the endpoint is not directly patient-relevant and is not presented. In addition, only patients who already had CNS disease at the time of enrolment in the study were included in the analysis. Patients without previous CNS disease or with first-time occurrence of CNS metastases were not included in the evaluation. Cross-endpoint assessment of patient-reported endpoints (PRO) data: With regard to the endpoints assessed in the CodeBreak 200 study using the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-LC13, BPI-SF, FACT-G GP5, and PGI-C questionnaires, IQWiG noted in the addendum to the dossier assessment that there was a differential percentage of patients included in the evaluation between the treatment arms for all corresponding endpoints of > 15 percentage points each, which is why IQWiG assessed the data as unsuitable overall. For the present assessment, the results for the respective endpoints, in particular the effect estimator, the confidence interval and the percentage of patients included in the evaluation in the treatment arms, are also taken into account in order to assess the extent to which these data are suitable or completely unsuitable for deriving statements on the additional benefit. Symptomatology In the endpoint category of morbidity, the CodeBreak 200 study recorded symptomatology using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC-13 questionnaires, the endpoints of worst pain and impairment due to pain using BPI-SF items 3 and 9a-g, respectively, and the endpoint of therapy burden using the single item GP5 from the FACT-G questionnaire. Health status In the CodeBreak 200 study, health status was assessed both with the PGI-C questionnaire (change in physical condition via the symptoms of cough, chest pain and shortness of breath) and via the EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS). With regard to the evaluations of the VAS of the EQ-5D, a statistically significant difference to the advantage of sotorasib over docetaxel is shown for the endpoint of health status. Symptomatology As a result of the above assessment of the data, the present assessment assumes an overall positive effect of sotorasib on symptomatology compared to docetaxel. This assessment is supported by the consistent and, in some cases, very significant effects on several endpoints on symptomatology as well as the statistically significant difference to the advantage of sotorasib in the endpoint of health status (EQ-5D VAS). Notwithstanding the fact that the differential percentage of > 15 percentage points per se results in a high risk of bias and a resulting large uncertainty, an overall advantage can thus be derived for sotorasib with regard to symptomatology. Conclusion on morbidity endpoints: In the overall analysis of the results, an advantage of sotorasib can be determined with regard to morbidity, the extent of which cannot be quantified. Health-related quality of life The health-related quality of life of the patients in the CodeBreak 200 study is assessed using the functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. As a result of the above assessment of the data, the large uncertainty predominates based on a weighing of the extent of the differential percentage of patients included in the treatment arms in the evaluation and the magnitude of the effects on the quality of life endpoints. Therefore, an effect on the overall quality of life cannot be assumed with sufficient certainty. The result is that the data are not assessable. Side effects Adverse events (AEs) in total In the CodeBreak 200 study, AEs occurred in both treatment arms in almost all study participants. The results were only presented additionally. Serious AEs (SAEs), severe AEs and discontinuation due to AEs There is no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms for each of the endpoints of SAEs, severe AEs and discontinuation due to AEs. Specific AEs Interstitial lung disease (severe AE) There was no statistically significant differences between the treatment arms for the specific AE of interstitial lung disease. Liver disorders (severe AEs) For the specific AE of liver disorders (severe AEs), there is a statistically significant difference to the disadvantage of sotorasib versus docetaxel. Other specific AEs For the specific AEs of stomatitis (AE), peripheral oedema (AE), peripheral neuropathy (AE), alopecia (AE), blood and lymphatic system disorders (AE), fatigue (AE), fever (AE) and infections and infestations (AE), there was a statistically significant difference to the advantage of sotorasib versus docetaxel. For the specific AE of chest pain (AE) and diarrhoea (AE), there was a statistically significant difference to the disadvantage of sotorasib versus docetaxel. For the AEs of fever (AE) and infections and infestations (AE), there is an effect modification by the age characteristic in each case. With regard to the AE of fever, there was a statistically significant difference for patients < 65 years of age to the advantage of sotorasib, whereas for patients ≥ 65 years of age there was no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms. With regard to the AE of infections and infestations (AE), there was a statistically significant difference for patients ≥ 65 years of age to the advantage of sotorasib, whereas for patients < 65 years of age there was no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms. This effect modification is not evident in other endpoints. Overall, the significance of the available subgroup results is considered insufficient for the assessment of the additional benefit. Patient-reported Outcome - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) In the CodeBreak 200 study, side effects were also recorded with the PRO-CTCAE instrument. However, it is not clear from the available documents on what basis the events were selected from the PRO-CTCAE system. More detailed information on the procedure was not provided by the pharmaceutical company. It is also not possible to tell whether the side effects of sotorasib and docetaxel are adequately shown. Overall, the results of the PRO-CTCAE cannot be used. In the overall assessment of the results on side effects, neither an advantage nor a disadvantage for treatment with sotorasib compared to docetaxel can be found. Overall assessment/ conclusion For the assessment of the additional benefit of sotorasib in adults with advanced NSCLC with KRAS p.G12C mutation after first-line therapy with an anti-PD 1/PD-L1 in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti-PD 1/PD-L1 and platinum-containing chemotherapy, results on mortality, morbidity, health-related quality of life and side effects are available from the open-label, randomised, controlled phase III CodeBreak 200 study. In the CodeBreak 200 study, sotorasib was compared to docetaxel. For the endpoint of overall survival, no statistically significant difference was detected between the treatment arms. With regard to the endpoints of symptomatology and health status, which were assessed in the CodeBreak 200 study by means of the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-LC13, BPI-SF, FACT-G GP5, and PGI-C questionnaires, there are uncertainties resulting from the differential percentage of patients of > 15 percentage points included in the evaluations between the treatment arms. With regard to the evaluations of the EQ-5D VAS, there is a statistically significant difference for the endpoint of health status to the advantage of sotorasib over docetaxel. In the overall analysis of the results, an advantage of sotorasib can be determined with regard to morbidity, the extent of which cannot be quantified. No assessable data are available for the endpoint category of health-related quality of life assessed using the functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. In the overall assessment of the results on side effects, neither an advantage nor a disadvantage for treatment with sotorasib compared to docetaxel can be found. In the overall assessment, therefore, a non-quantifiable additional benefit over docetaxel is identified for sotorasib as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with advanced NSCLC with KRAS p.G12C mutation after first-line therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and platinum-containing chemotherapy for which docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy. Reliability of data (probability of additional benefit) The present benefit assessment is based on the results of the randomised, open-label phase III CodeBreak 200 study. The risk of bias across endpoints at the study level is rated as generally low for the CodeBreak 200 study. However, there are uncertainties regarding the implementation of the criteria specified in the context of the appropriate comparator therapy for the treatment decision for the use of docetaxel as an appropriate patient-individual therapeutic alternative. The risk of bias of the results for the endpoint of overall survival is rated as high. This is justified by the high percentage of patients who switch from the docetaxel arm to the sotorasib arm during the course of the study and due to the unclear percentage of censoring at the start of the study. At the endpoint level of the endpoint category of side effects and for the endpoint of health status, the risk of bias is classified as high due to the differential percentages of patients included in the evaluations between the treatment arms. For the endpoints of health status, discontinuation due to AEs, non-severe and non-serious specific AEs, the lack of blinding additionally contributes to the high risk of bias of the results. Overall, a hint is derived for the reliability of data of the additional benefit identified. c2) Adults for whom a therapy other than docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy An additional benefit is not proven. Justification For the sub-population of adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS p.G12C mutation after first-line therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and platinum-containing chemotherapy and for whom a therapy other than docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy, no statements on the additional benefit can be made taking into account the CodeBreak 200 study. Since only results with a comparison to docetaxel were presented for the benefit assessment, no usable data are available overall. An additional benefit of sotorasib is therefore not proven for sub-population c2).",

      "text": "The present assessment is a new benefit assessment of the active ingredient sotorasib due to the expiry of the limitation of the resolution of 4 August 2022. The assessment relates exclusively to the use of sotorasib as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS G12C mutation who have been diagnosed with progression after at least one prior systemic therapy, in the following patient population: b) Adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS p.G12C mutation after first-line therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy The appropriate comparator therapy includes different chemotherapies without platinum (cisplatin/ carboplatin) as well as treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor as monotherapy. No data are available to allow an assessment of the additional benefit. An additional benefit is therefore not proven. c) Adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS p.G12C mutation after first-line therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy or after sequential therapy with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and platinumcontaining chemotherapy The appropriate comparator therapy comprises patient-individual therapy with a choice of afatinib, pemetrexed, erlotinib, docetaxel, docetaxel in combination with ramucirumab, docetaxel in combination with nintedanib and vinorelbine, taking into account prior therapy and histology. For the benefit assessment, the pharmaceutical company presents data from the randomised, controlled, open-label phase III CodeBreak 200 study comparing sotorasib versus docetaxel. Due to the lack of comparison with other treatment options, the CodeBreak200 study only allows statements to be made on the additional benefit of sotorasib in those patients for whom docetaxel is the most appropriate patient-individual therapy. Based on the available evidence, the G-BA therefore considers it appropriate to form two patient groups according to their patient-individual suitability for docetaxel: c1) Adults for whom docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy and c2) Adults for whom a therapy other than docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy on c1) Results on mortality, morbidity, health-related quality of life and side effects are available from the CodeBreak 200 study. For the endpoint of overall survival, no statistically significant difference was detected between the treatment arms. Uncertainties exist with regard to the endpoints of symptomatology and health status. In the overall analysis of the results, an advantage of sotorasib can be determined with regard to morbidity, the extent of which cannot be quantified. No assessable data are available for the endpoint category of health-related quality of life. In the overall assessment of the results on side effects, neither an advantage nor a disadvantage of treatment with sotorasib can be found. In the overall assessment, therefore, a non-quantifiable additional benefit over docetaxel is identified for sotorasib for the sub-population of adults with pretreated locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation, for whom docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy. Overall, a hint is derived for the reliability of data of the additional benefit identified. on c2) For the sub-population of adults with pretreated locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation, for whom a therapy other than docetaxel is the appropriate patient-individual therapy, no statements on the additional benefit can be made on the basis of the CodeBreak 200 study, as no usable data are available. An additional benefit of sotorasib is therefore not proven for sub-population c2).",

Alternatively, the pharmacy sales price publicly accessible in the directory services according to Section 131, paragraph 4 SGB V is a suitable basis for a standardised calculation. According to the currently valid version of the special agreement on contractual unit costs of retail pharmacist services (Hilfstaxe), surcharges for the production of parenteral preparations containing cytostatic drugs a maximum amount of € 100 per ready-to-use preparation, and for the production of parenteral solutions containing monoclonal antibodies a maximum of € 100 per ready-to-use unit are to be payable. These additional other costs do not add to the pharmacy sales price but follow the rules for calculation in the special agreement on contractual unit costs of retail pharmacist services (Hilfstaxe). The cost representation is based on the pharmacy retail price and the maximum surcharge for the preparation and is only an approximation of the treatment costs. This presentation does not take into account, for example, the rebates on the pharmacy purchase price of the active ingredient, the invoicing of discards, the calculation of application containers, and carrier solutions in accordance with the regulations in Annex 3 of the special agreement on contractual unit costs of retail pharmacist services (Hilfstaxe). 9 To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and on the day of pemetrexed administration as well as the day after. 2.5 Medicinal products with new active ingredients according to Section 35a, paragraph 3, sentence 4 SGB V that can be used in a combination therapy with Sotorasib According to Section 35a, paragraph 3, sentence 4, the G-BA designates all medicinal products with new active ingredients that can be used in a combination therapy with the assessed medicinal product for the therapeutic indication to be assessed on the basis of the marketing authorisation under Medicinal Products Act. In accordance with Section 2, paragraph 1, sentence 1 Ordinance on the Benefit Assessment of Pharmaceuticals (AM-NutzenV), only medicinal products containing active ingredients whose effects are not generally known in medical science at the time of initial marketing authorisation are to be considered within the framework of the designation of medicinal products with new active ingredients that can be used in a combination therapy. According to Section 2, paragraph 1, sentence 2 Ordinance on the Benefit Assessment of Pharmaceuticals (AM-NutzenV), a medicinal product with a new active ingredient is considered to be a medicinal product with a new active ingredient for as long as there is dossier protection for the medicinal product with the active ingredient that was authorised for the first time. The designation of the combination therapies is based solely on the specifications according to Section 35a, paragraph 3, sentence 4. The G-BA does not conduct a substantive review based on the generally recognised state of medical knowledge. Thus, the designation is not associated with a statement as to the extent to which a therapy with the designated medicinal product with new active ingredient in combination with the medicinal product to be assessed corresponds to the generally recognised state of medical knowledge.",
