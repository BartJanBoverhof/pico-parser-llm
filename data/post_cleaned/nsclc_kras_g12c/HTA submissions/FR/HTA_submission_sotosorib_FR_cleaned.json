The current therapeutic management of the CRNPC is identical whether or not patients have a KRAS mutation (including G12 C). At the metastatic stage (IV), it is recommended that second-line therapy be offered systematically, whether patients have responded to a first-line metastasis or not. The nature of this treatment depends on the molecules previously used, the ECOG score and the histology: - Patients treated with immunotherapy monotherapy in the first line: chemotherapy based on platinum salts, such as in the 1st line: cisplatin-vinorelbine, cisplatine-citagembine, carboplatin-paclitaxel, cisplain-docetaxel, Cisplatin -pemetrexed (non-epidermoid only); - patients treated with chemotherapeutic therapy + immunotherapies in the line 1: chemotherapists in the single line: pemetrexed, docetaxel (non -epidermoside only). + first-line chemotherapy : monotherapy: docetaxel, pemetrexed (non-epidermoid only) A combination of paclitaxel + bevacizumab may also be proposed; - patients receiving first line bi-chemotherapy, without immunotherapy.: in the absence of a contraindication, immunotherapeutic treatment is the reference: atezolizumab, nivolumab or pembrolizimab (if PD-L1 ≥ 1%), with no hierarchy between these different treatments. In view of the currently poorly defined prognostic and predictive value of the KRAS G12C mutation in the CBNPC, and the absence of comparative data of acceptable methodological quality, the place of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) in relation to the available therapeutic alternatives (chemotherapy, immunotherapy) cannot be specified.",

Sotoratib has been associated with transient elevations in serum transaminases (ALT and AST). These elevation were reduced or resolved by dose adjustment or discontinuation of therapy and did not result in hepatic failure or death in clinical studies. Patients should be monitored for liver function (ALT, AST and total bilirubin) prior to initiation of LUMYKRAS therapy, every 3 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, then monthly or as clinically indicated, with more frequent monitoring in patients with elevated transaminases and/ or bilirubin. If PI/inflammatory pneumonia is suspected, LUMYKRAS should be discontinued immediately and other etiologies eliminated. Treatment should be permanently discontinue if no other potential cause of PI/ inflammatory pulmonary disease is identified (see section 4.2). Use data The laboratory provided the results of the first quarterly ATU synthesis report covering the period from 09 August 2021 to 29 October 2021. Sotorasib is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of adult patients with pre-treated non-small cell bronchial cancer (NSCBC) KRAS p.G12C metastasis. A total of 447 requests for access to treatment were made during this period, 7 of which were refused. Of the 440 accepted requests, 414 patients were considered to be treated (drug provided by the laboratory). Of these, 403 were deemed to be exposed (11 patients who had never considered the treatment). The majority of the 414 treated patients were active smokers (52%) and 66% of the patients (8%) were men. The most frequent metastatic locations were pulmonary (51%), adrenal (50%) and bone (41%). Notably, 10% of patients had active central nervous system metastases, and 20% non-active metastasis. The median number of anterior lines received was 2 (min-max: 0-9). The other patients had 1 anterior line (43%), 2 anterior lines (31%), 3 anterior lines (16%) or 4 anterior lines and more (10%). Only 47 patients will have a first documented follow-up visit. Summary & Discussion The application for LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) in the monotherapy indication for the treatment of adult patients with advanced CBNPC with KRAS G12C mutation whose disease has progressed after at least one prior systemic line of therapy is based primarily on a non-comparative Phase 2 basket study (CodeBreak 100) and on data from indirect comparisons. Efficacy (including quality of life) A total of 126 patients with a CBNPC were included. The median age was 64 years, with a similar proportion of men/women (50%) and patients in good general condition, with an ECOG stage of 0 (30%) or 1 (70%). Almost all patients had metastatic disease (96%) and non-epidermoid tumour (99%). In total, 43% of patients had received only one initial line, 35% had received two lines and 22% had received three lines. The main objective analysis was based on 123 patients (corresponding to the September 2020 ICU analysis), with 29% or 37% of patients being considered as having no complete response. Among the secondary endpoints, the median duration of response was 8.4 months (IC95%: 6.9-8.4), the progression-free survival was 6.7 months (I.C. 95%: 4.9-8.1) and the overall survival rate was 12.0 months (9.5-NE). Exploratory follow-up data suggested similar results. Finally, for one of these factors (the ECOG score), 62% of missing data were imputed using an optimistic imputation method (best case scenario). Overall, a bias in the estimation of the relative efficacy of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) compared to conventional treatments cannot be made, due to the absence of laboratory confusion and an inadequate data management method. The results of the first AATU report are therefore not conclusive and no conclusions can be drawn from it. Note that the laboratory also provided data from the first ATU report. However, due to the limited number (11%) of available follow-up data (insufficient accuracy and possibility of bias), they are unlikely to provide robust evidence to assess the efficacy and tolerability of sotorasib, and will not be described. Due to the non-comparative design of the study, no formal conclusions can be drawn on quality of life. Discussion In the absence of direct comparative data, while clinically relevant comparators were available and the prognostic/ predictive effect of the KRAS G12C mutation is poorly defined, the only data submitted to assess the relative efficacy of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) compared to standard therapies are derived from an indirect comparison. Therefore, the only efficacy and tolerability data are from a non-comparative cohort of the Basketball Study (CodeBreak 100). This study showed an objective response rate, assessed by an independent panel of 37% [95% CI: 29-47]. However, it should be emphasised that: - the non-comparative design only allows an estimation of the absolute effect of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib), and not its additional relative efficacy compared to the efficacy of existing treatments, the placebo effect and the natural course of the disease; - this result was observed in a selected population (including those with ECOG 0 or 1, no active brain metastases): the transferability of the results to a population with a worse prognosis (OGEC 1, > active brain Metastases) cannot be assured; furthermore, the tolerability profile was marked by an incidence of serious undesirable events of ≥ 3 grades in two out of three patients (51%) and of serious unintended events in ≥ one out of two patients (65%). Given the efficacy and tolerability data (preliminary data in a non-comparative study whereas clinically relevant comparators were available), the limitations in the transferability of the results and the lack of demonstrated impact on quality of life, the additional impact of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) on morbidity-mortality and quality of Life has not been demonstrated to date. Additional data are expected at the EMA level by 31 March 2023 (Phase III CodeBreak 200 study, see next paragraph). Study programme in the CBNPC Study name Availability Schedule Phase III randomised, open-label, docetaxel-versus-tested data in CodeBbreak End 2022 - early adult patients with advanced CRBC with the 2023 KRAS G12C mutation, previously treated in IFCT-2012 Retrospective observational study including End 2022 Lung patients treated under the KATUc K12C PLACE IN THE THERAPY STRATEGY Systematic search for the KRAS mutation is recommended before initiating line 1 treatment of the CBnPC. At the metastatic stage (IV), it is recommended that second-line therapy be offered systematically, whether or not patients have responded to a first metastasis line. The nature of this treatment depends on the molecules previously used, the ECOG score and the histology: - Patients treated with immunotherapy in monotherapy line 1 Patients: chemotherapy based on platinum salts, such as cisplatin-orelvin, cisplacitabine-platinoplatin, carbamazepine-platine-platinerol, cisplatina-docetaxel, cis-methotrexate (non-treated): monotherapeutically; - Immunotherapy patients: non-chemotherapy by pemetrexed + cismoxide (monotherapy only). LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) in the therapeutic strategy: Despite the low level of evidence, and pending new data on efficacy and tolerability, the Committee considers that the use of the monotherapy regimen of LUMyKRas (sortorasib), as a single agent, is an option for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in adults, after prior treatment of systemic cancer. In view of the currently poorly defined prognostic and predictive value of the KRAS G12C mutation in the CBNPC, and the absence of comparative data of acceptable methodological quality, the place of LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) in relation to the available therapeutic alternatives (chemotherapy, immunotherapy) cannot be specified. It should be emphasised that, in this context where no data of comparable methodical quality are available to ensure the robustness of the conclusion on the effect of treatment with LUMyKRasib, the introduction of this medicinal product into the therapy strategy must be accompanied by a greater risk for adverse drug reactions than is acceptable on the basis of a summary of product characteristics (RPG) and a comparison with the pharmacological properties of the product (RGP) on which the efficacy summary is based. The Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and the Risk Management Plan (RMP) must be complied with. Use of this medicinal product in pregnant or breast-feeding women must comply with the SPC CONCLUSIONS OF THE COMMISSION Taking all of this information into account and after discussion and voting, the Commission considers that: Advanced non-small cell lung cancer with KRAS G12C mutation is a serious disease with a life-threatening prognosis.",

Taking all these elements into account, the Commission considers that the medical service (MSS) provided by LUMyKRas (sutorasib), is low in the MAMM indication. The Commission gives a favourable opinion on the inclusion of the MSR in the list of reimbursable specialties based on socially assisted specialties, in the absence of a demonstrated impact on morbidity, mortality and quality of life, and on the lack of data to evaluate a possible additional impact on the care and/ or life course.",

Target population The target population for LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) is adult patients with advanced CBNPC, with KRAS G12C mutation, whose disease has progressed after at least one prior systemic treatment line. In France, the number of new cases of lung cancer was estimated at 46,363 in 2018, representing 85% of the histological types, or 39,409 patients.10 According to the KBP-2010-CHG study, approximately 80% of patients with CBNCP were diagnosed at an advanced or metastatic stage (stage III or IV), or 31 528 patients. Furthermore, it is estimated that 40% of patients diagnosed with an advanced stage localized to an additional 34 metastatics or advanced stage diagnosed incidents, or an estimated 683 patients in the year, or 153 311 patients. Thus, the number of incident patients with advanced or metastatic CBNPC is estimated to be 34,681 patients. The prevalence of the KRAS G12C mutation has been estimated at 14%, i. e. approximately 4,856 patients. According to ESME cohort data (unpublished report), approximately 40% of patients with a CBNCP with a KRASG12C Mutation have received at least 2 lines of treatment, i.e. 1,943 patients. The Commission will re-evaluate LUMYKRAS (sotorasib) in the light of these data, and any new data that may become available.",
