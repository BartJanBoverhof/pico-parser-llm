Rossi's thinking mind, lively spirit, intelligent spirit, Giulio has taught us to look better and to look beyond the path of the physician, Pat has accompanied us in the journey of precision medicine. A pathologist of undisputed ability, he accompanied us on the path towards precision medicine. A brilliant person, able to make complex concepts simple sentences accessible to everyone, he took pathological anatomy to a higher level and he always did it by putting himself back in the game and with a light in his eyes, which none of us will ever forget. Sometimes spiny, sometimes sarcastic, but always proactive. Argento vivo, nomadic soul, starting from Modena, Giulio directed the Divisions of Pathological Anatomy of Aosta, Ravenna, Brescia, leaving deep signs of himself, humanly and professionally. Always available and attentive to the needs of patients. He was a person with whom to compare and trust, a mentor and a friend for everyone. He taught us to think differently until the end and often to have the courage to change, even in the conventional way, we will never forget. Unlike Giulio Rossi, we have all been able to constantly ask ourselves the question: is it better to change something?",

      "heading": "2.1 Risk factors",
      "text": "Cigarette smoking is the main risk factor for the development of lung cancer, accounting for 85-90% of the cases observed in our country (1). The relative risk of developing lung cancer is closely correlated with a number of factors including: the number of cigarettes smoked per day, the duration (in years) of the smoking habit and the tar content of the cigarettes (2). The risk of smokers (considered in toto) compared to non-smokers is 14, while that of heavy smokers (20 cigarettes per day) is 20. For those who stop smoking, the risk gradually decreases over the next 10-15 years, with a significant advantage in terms of years of life gained by those who quit smoking before the age of 40 years (3-4). European studies and collaborative meta-analyses for passive smokers show an increase in the risk of cancer developing compared to nonsmokers, between 20% and 50% (5-6). A demographic survey on the smoking habits of Italians carried out by Doxa for the year 2019 on behalf of the Istituto Superiore di Sanità and in collaboration with l'Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri (7) has shown a slight decrease in the number of smokers in Italy, which currently represents 22% of the entire population (28% men, 16.5% women), compared to 23.3% in 2018 (27.7% men, 19.2% women). There is a variability in the percentage of smoking subjects in different geographical areas of the country (North: 28% men, 14% women; Center: 23.9% men, 12.1% women; South: 30.2% men, 22.4% women). The growing prevalence of cigarette smoking among adolescents aged between 14 and 17 years is a worrying problem in our country, where a percentage of \"baby-smokers\" of 11% (about 254,000 young people) was recorded in 2018, which is one of the highest in Europe. In parallel to a slight decrease in the number of cigarettes sold in recent years, there has been an increasing consumption of handmade cigarettes, more widespread among men, young people and in the regions of southern Italy, and new products have emerged on the market, promoted by the industry as harmful alternatives to tobacco use, but in fact making them less attractive to new consumers and addicts: nicotine-containing tobacco products and e-cigarettes, for example. Many substances of occupational and/or environmental origin (asbestos, radon, chromium, arsenic, beryllium, vinyl chloride, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chloromethyl ether and others) are recognised as lung carcinogens which may, as in the case of asbestos or radon enhance their carcinogenic effect in the presence of tobacco smoke. The World Health Organisation (WHO), through the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), has classified asbestosis and radon in Group 1, which lists substances (including cigarette smoke) for which there is sufficient evidence of toxicity to cancer, on the basis of epidemiological studies conducted by the IARC, and has been classified by the LARC as a carcinogen for human exposure. Exposure to fine particulate matter and air pollution has been classified as carcinogenic to humans by the IARC. The AHSMOG-2 study assessed the association between fine particulates (PM2.5) and lung cancer in non-smokers, identifying a 22% increased risk of lung cancer for every 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 in the environment (8). The ESCAPE study showed a 55% increased risk for lung adenocarcinoma, the most frequent isotope in nonsmokers (9). An increasing role of genetic predisposition and, in particular, polymorphic genes has been demonstrated in recent years, although the predominance of environmental factors in tumour etiology remains (10).",

      "heading": "Primary prevention",
      "text": "Italy was one of the first countries in Europe to adopt in 2005 the new preventive measures MPOWER provided for by the smoking control program, promoted by the WHO. These measures, including for example the ban on smoking in public places, immediately produced a drastic decrease in the percentage of smokers in our country. In 2013 the prohibition of smoking was extended to schools, beaches and public parks. According to a demographic survey carried out by DOXA in 2023 in Italy, habitual and occasional users of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are about 1.300.000, of which 85% are consumers who smoke conventional and e-cig cigarettes at the same time and, in particular, those containing nicotine. On the other hand, the habitual and casual users of heated tobacco cigarettes are about 1.9 million, of whom 86% are consumers that smoke conventions and e -cig. A recent Cochrane systematic review analysed 2 randomised trials (n=662) comparing nicotine-based e-cigarettes vs. placebo (nicotine-free) in smokers, showing a significant reduction in smoking habits in favour of nicotine based e‐cigarette use (9% abstinence vs. 4%; relative risk 2.29; 95% CI 1.05-4.96). However, the studies assessed included few patients and used devices no longer available on the market because they were outperformed by new generation devices. The authors therefore define the quality of the available evidence as 'low grade', which does not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn today on the long-term efficacy and safety of these devices, especially when used in combination with traditional cigarettes. A randomised 3-phase study of 886 patients enrolled in the United Kingdom showed that e-cigarettes were more effective than nicotine-based devices in smoking cessation in smokers with a rate of abstinence of 1 to 9.00% versus 1.8 to 1.9%, respectively (ICR < 0.003%, ICR < 1.83% versus 1.89%, PRI < 0.93%). As regards the tolerability profile, irritation of the oral mucosa was observed more frequently in the e-cigarette arm (65.3% vs 51.2%), while nausea was more frequent in the control arm (37.9% vs 31.3%). The impossibility of maintaining a blinded randomisation and the limited follow-up of the study reduce, also in this case, the reliability of the reported results (13). A key contribution to primary prevention in our country comes from the many awareness-raising activities and campaigns carried out and coordinated by the Ministry of Health, the scientific society, patient associations and general practitioners in the country. awareness-raising campaigns carried out and coordinated by the Ministry of Health, scientific societies, patient associations and general practitioners operating in the area.There are, for example, a number of AIOM awarenesses and WALCE Onlus primary prevention programmes.Further measures and initiatives are however necessary and desirable, as it is now clear that reducing cigarette smoking leads to a significant reduction in the incidence and mortality associated with lung cancer, confirming the predominant role of primaryprevention in the fight against this neoplasm.",

      "text": "The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) was the first study to demonstrate that early diagnosis of lung cancer with annual low-dose thoracic CT (LDCT) in high-risk subjects (55-74 years, smokers or ex-smokers within 15 years of enlistment) resulted in a 20% reduction in mortality associated with this neoplasm compared to standard chest radiography (15). Recently, the USPSFT updated its recommendations on lung cancer screening with LDCT, notably broadening the age range of subjects to include, between 50 and 80 years (vs 55 to 80 years), and reducing smoking history to 20 pack/years (vs 30 pack-years) (17). In Europe, 6 randomised trials have been conducted (MILD [18], ITALUNG [19], DANTE [20], DLCST [21], LUSI [22], NELSON [23]) that compared a single annual screening strategy using LDCt vs usual or expensive observation in smokers and ex-smokers. RECOMMENDATION: In smokers or ex-smokers who have smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day for more than 25 years, or at least 10 cigarettes per day for over 30 years or who have quit smoking less than 10 years previously, annual chest CT screening should be considered as the first option. Strength of recommendation: Strong support Reasons/comments on the benefit/harm balance: A meta-analysis based on recent data published in the literature has combined and analysed all randomised clinical trials comparing lung screening versus no LDCT screening (NSC) or chest radiography (XRD) with subjects with a history of smoking to provide an accurate estimate of the benefits and harms associated with LDCTs, in order to provide a reliable estimate. The pooled analysis showed that LDCT is associated with: a significant decrease in lung cancer-related mortality (overall RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.78-0.98; NS RR 0,80; 95% IC 0.69-0. 92); a significant increase in the diagnosis of early stage cancers (over all RR 2.84; 95% CI 1.76-4.58; NSR 3.33; 95% CI 2.27-4.89; CXR RR2; 1.595% CI 1.04-2.23); a substantial decreuse in the diagnoses of advanced stage cancer (over All RR 0.575; IC 0.968-0.83; RR 6.67; IC 0.56-0.85); an increased surgically significant rate of surgical resectability (IC 0.75%; IC 1.594%; IC 2.595%; RR 14.94); an increase in all causes of death by 38%, no significant reduction in the rate of IC over all causes (IC 1.76-95%; NSR 0.94-1.5); Although there is still uncertainty about the precise estimate of the rate of overdiagnosis, this meta-analysis suggested that the benefits associated with LDCT screening outweigh the harms, in subjects with a history of cigarette smoking, ultimately supporting the systematic implementation of lung cancer screening in the world and in Italy (24). In order to optimise the diagnostic accuracy of the methodology and to ensure the creation of dedicated diagnostic pathways, several specific aspects related to the implementation of screening in the national territory are currently being defined, such as the CT acquisition protocol, the lung nodule analysis methodology, and the optimal time interval to be used, and many of these aspects are currently evaluated within the RISP project (Rete Italiana Screening Polmonare). The NELSON study, on the other hand, uses, as do other European studies including MILD, a nodule volume analysis together with a specific doubling time evaluation methodology. This has resulted in a base round screening positive outcome rate of 2.1% with a high positive predictive value of 43.5%, which falls within the criteria needed to implement screening (23). Therefore, with regard to the measurement and management of lung nodules, almost all European companies suggest volumetric evaluation as the minimum requirement for accurate lung cancer screening, compared to manual measures of one year. The NELSON study (23) used a different approach, with screening intervals varying between screening cycles (1 year between baseline and the second round of screening, 2 years between the second and third rounds of screenings, and 2.5 years from the third to the fourth rounds). However, a screening period of 2.5 years led to a higher rate of neoplasia diagnosis than the 1 and 2 intervals, thus leading to the conclusion that LDCT screening periods should not exceed 2 years. A recent study showed that screening every 2 years can be done in subjects with a negative baseline test (26). At European level, in recent years, several scientific societies have supported the implementation of lung cancer screening through the publication of specific recommendations, including the European Respiratory Society (ERS), the European Society of Respirology (ESR), the American Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS), the Alliance for Personalized Medicine (APE), the British Society of Radiation Oncology (MOMO) and the Swiss Medical University Hospitals. In addition, a statement of agreement was published by the European Parliament and the Council of Europe in conjunction with the Polish Cancer Screening Protocol. More recently, the ESR/ERS produced a declaration encouraging Europe and healthcare systems to implement large-scale screening programmes that can provide citizens with properly organised pathways to achieve the benefits of screening (28). In this context, the Italian Network Screening Pulmonare is participating in a larger European multi-centre project, 4-IN-THE-LUNG-RUN (4-iRTL), which has already recruited more than 10,000 subjects at high risk of developing lung tumours (more than 8000 of whom have already undergone the first LDCT) and will optimise biomarker based screening techniques for the purpose of individual risk assessment, by defining more advanced methods for the assessment of risk associated with LDCTs.",

      "text": "The recommended histopathological classification for the diagnosis of lung cancer is the fifth edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) updated in 2021. More than 95% of lung carcinomas can be traced back to 4 main histotypes: squamous cell carcinoma (SC), adenocarcinom (ADC), large cell cancer (CGC) and small cell carceroma (microcythoma) (29). In Western countries, the frequency of SCAD is in sharp increase (>50%), while SC and microcythomas are in significant decrease (29). Diagnosis may be based solely on conventional morphological criteria observable in haematoxylin-eosin or by specific staining (e.g. May-Grunwald-Giemsa) adopted in cytological preparations, but immunohistochemical investigations (IHC) may also result in precise histotype definition in the case of poorly differentiated or not otherwise specified NSCLC (NAS) (29, 31, 33-34). In order to preserve neoplastic tissue for predictive molecular investigations, in poorly-differentiated/NASLCs lacking neuroendocrine morphology, the minimum baseline immunophenotypic panel suggested by the WHO is represented by TTF- 1 (Thyroid Transcription Factor-1), marker ADC40, and marker CS40. anti-TTF-1 clone 8G7G3/1 is more specific than the corresponding clones SPT24 and SP141. In pulmonary neoplasms with neuroendocrine cytoarchitecture, the markers to be used to confirm differentiation are chromogranin, synaptophysin and CD56 (29, 31, 33, 35). It should be recalled that abnormal immunophenotypes may be observed (e.g. p40-positive ADCs, but this usually shows focal and non-intense immunoreactivity) (29). The new WHO classification pays particular attention to a rather rare entity, Large Neurocrine Cell Carcinoma (LNECSC), which morphologically can simulate a poorly differentiated NLC and necessarily requires neurochemical diagnostics confirming differentiation by exo-immunoprophylactic investigation of immune cells (29). In addition, a number of immunohistochemical investigations, which may reveal aberrant and focal expression of non-specific neuroendocrine markers (e.g. CD56), have revealed a significant but often unfounded increase in the incidence of this entity which has consequently produced suboptimal or inappropriate therapeutic approaches. Molecular studies have in fact shown that >50% of LCNECs are actually poorly differentiated NSCLCs and in particular solid pattern ADCs (36). Therefore, a careful integrated assessment of the most specific neuroendocrinal markers is recommended (i.e. chromogranin and synaptophysin) in the correct morphological context. For the definition of the isotype can be applied both to biopsy samples fixed in formalin and to cytological preparations (37-40). Of great practical utility is the effective management of cytological samples from shedding or cytoaspiration, which should provide for the preparation of cytoinclusions (cell-block) especially in view of the possibility of analyzing via IHC some of the predictive biomarkers of response to medical therapy, such as the Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-1) L (41). During simple/guided suffocation procedures (transbronchial, transthoracic, transesophageal) or on the occasion of injections, it is strongly recommended to prepare one or more inclusions in paraffin from cyto-block (cell use). The pre-use of the cytoallusion, with the integration of conventional cytological investigational preparations, allows for easier and more reliable execution of cytotoxic molecules (including TTF-1) in situ and for diagnostic purposes. TTF-1 and p40) and predictive (e.g. ALK, ROS1, PD-L1) (37-41). However, it should be noted that the striped or thin-layered cell sample offers higher quality than the cell-block, especially in terms of fixation artifacts and length of nucleic acid fragments. For patients with advanced stage NSCLC, given the need to evaluate PD-l1 expression and the presence of possible translocations of the ALK gene, the use of antibodies validated on samples fixed in formalin and included in paraffin, as well as the possibility of performing IHC screening for ROS1 gene alterations, the editing of a cell-blood is strongly recommended, especially when there is no available histology or surgical resection of the samples (WHO Classification 2021 - Table 3.1-4: Tumors).",

      "text": "Molecular characterisation of lung tumours, a key element in the patient's diagnostic and care pathway, offers the possibility of recommending molecular targeted treatments in populations selected for the presence or expression of a particular marker. In all patients with stage IIIB-IIIC NSCLC (not candidates for locoregional therapy) and stage IV, morphological diagnosis should be complemented by molecular characterisation including search for mutations in the EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) gene, BRAF (B-Raf proto-oncogene) and KRAS (Kirsten RAt Sarcoma virus), ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) translocations, ROS1 (Proto-Oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase), ROSET (angrenous during Transfection), NTRK (Neurotrophic Receptors) kinases 1, 2 and 3 and skipping of the kinesin (Tyrosine) kinase (MET) at the level of 14%, 19, 20% and 20% respectively, respectively. However, this class of alterations is currently a positive predictive marker of response to specific selective inhibitors available in clinical practice (e.g. amivantamab) (52). The rearrangements of the ALK oncogene with EML-4 or other fusion partners on the short arm of chromosome 2 encode for a specific protein with tyrosine kinase activity that is involved in cell survival and proliferation processes. Chromosomal rearrangements involving the tyrosine kinase domain of the ALK gene are present in approximately 3-7% of pulmonary ADCs and identify a subset of patients who are candidates for treatment with first (crizotinib), second (alectinib, ceritinib, brigatinib) and new generation ALK inhibitors (lorlatinib) (53-58). V600 point mutations in the BRAF gene exon 15 (the main one being the c.1799T>A point mutation responsible for the p.V600E amino acid variation) are reported in approximately 3-4% of patients with ADC isotype lung cancer (61) and identify a subgroup of patients who are candidates for treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors of BraF-MEK (e.g. dafenib-trametinib). Additional detectable molecular alterations in ADC for currently available target therapies include: rearrangements of the RET-2 gene (1%), mutations causing a matrix transcription abnormality (skipping the exon level of the GET2 gene) (11-12%) and the KRAS-62 gene mutation demonstrating skipping of the MET 2 gene (11-14%) Although chromosomal rearrangements of the NTRK 1, 2 and 3 genes are reported in approximately 0.5-1% of pulmonary ADCs, it is strongly suggested that they be investigated in conjunction with other molecular alterations, as they are a predictor of response to some tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. entrectinib) (67). Finally, among the approved predictive biomarkers useful in defining the therapeutic strategy is PD-L1 re-expression for the selection of patients with advanced NSCLC eligible for line I immunotherapy. Patients may be eligible for immunotherapy treatment if their tumour sample contains at least 100 viable tumour cells, is tested with validated antibody clones, and shows PD-L1 positivity ≥ 50% of tumour cell counts as measured by the Tumor Proportional Score (TPS) (68). In patients with advanced NSCLC, line II eligibility for pembrolizumab predicts a TPS ≥ 1%. In summary, evaluation, preferably by next-generation sequencing (NGS), of molecular alterations to EGFR exons 18, 19, 20 and 21, ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK rearrangements, MET 14 skipping, V600 point mutations to BRAF 15 gene, G12C mutation to KRAS, and immunohistochemical evaluation (HCI) of PD-L1 expression are required for the definition of ISC therapeutic strategy in all patients with advanced NLC and ADC histotypes, including those with CS but < 50 years of age and f/2. In patients with f/1.50 years or older, specifically for the evaluation of the PD-MHC1 skipping biomarker (e. g. In patients with early disease stage undergoing radical surgical resection, single gene or NGS assessment of molecular alterations at EGFR exons 18, 19, 20 and 21, and ALK rearrangements, and immunohistochemical assessment (IHC) of PD-L1 expression are recommended in clinical practice for defining the adjuvant therapeutic strategy (Algorithm 2). Determination of EGFR mutational status Patients with histopathological ADSCLC, CGC, NSCLC comprising the neoplastic component of ADC and NSC as well as in cases of squamous cell carcinoma of very young females (TT/TT+1), or in patients with malignant EGFR, the mutation test may not be carried out in the unlikely event that the tumour is malignant. In addition, the search for EGFR mutations may be required in cases of squamous carcinoma diagnosed on extremely limited tissue biopsies or on cytological samples in which the presence of a mixed component (adenosquamous) not intercepted by the interventional procedure is suspected and/ or cannot be completely excluded (74): • the determination of EGFR Mutations can be performed either on surgical sample or on bioptic or cytological sampling of the primary tumour and/or metastasis (74); • as specified in section 7.2.1 (Treatment of the EGFR-mutated disease) the need to identify all clinically relevant EGFR gene mutations, including the inclusion of the international reference 20, which allows the selection of a suitable patient, within the appropriate range of diagnostic and treatment procedures, should be adequately documented, with adequate patient references, and adequate diagnostic procedures. Determination of BRAF mutational status Patients with ADC, CGC, ADC-mixed NSCLC and NAS NSCLLC should be subjected to a mutational analysis of BraF; molecular analysis may also be required in cases of squamous carcinoma diagnosed on extremely limited tissue biopsies or on cytological samples in which the presence of a mixed component (adenosquamous) not detected by the interventional procedure is suspected and/ or cannot be completely excluded (61): • Determining BF mutations can be performed either on a single sample of preoperative or cytologic biopsy of the primary and metastatic tumour (61); it is particularly appropriate to distinguish between the mutations of BFRAV and p600 and P600. Patients with ADC, CS, CGC, ADC-mixed NSCLC and NASSCLC must be tested for KRAS mutation: • the determination of KRAS p.G12C mutation can be performed either on surgical specimen or on biopsy or cytological sampling of the primary tumour and/or metastasis (66); • the use of appropriate technologies to characterize KRAS mutations that distinguish uniquely, especially between p. G12C and non-p.G.12C (66) is strongly recommended.",

Initially, the baseline diagnostic survey for the detection of the ALK gene rearrangements was the FISH (Fluorescence In Hybridization Situation), although in the initial regulatory assessment, significant increases were already demonstrated with reference to a valid RT-PCI or IHC test (77-9). In recent years, the evidence supporting the use of IHC has increased considerably (77-79). The AIFA reimbursability authorisation of crizotinib (April 2015) specifies that the tests that can be used to identify patients with ALK rearrangement, eligible for treatment with crizitinib, are both IHC and FISH. For the FISH test, a cut-off of at least 15% of re-arranged neoplastic cells is indicated to define positive (80). In IHC, it is possible to use different anti-ALK antibodies. The Ventana KIT with D5F3 clone predicts a positive/negative dichotomous type result, while alternative clones such as 5A4 (Leica/Novoc) and IALK1 (Dako) and the pira use predict different forms of a strong (0+), weak (0+) and moderate negative score (3+). and/or the use of different platforms predict a negative (0), weak (1+), moderate (2+) and strong (3+) score. A score of 0 identifies an ALK-negative tumour, whereas a score of 3+ coincides with ALK positivity, while a positive score of 1+ and 2+ requires further confirmation by FISH (77-81). Following the approval of alectinib as the treatment line for patients with rearranged ALK NSCLC, and given the latest evidence in the scientific literature, it is now also possible to analyse ALK rearrangeings using specific panels, validated for diagnostic use by the European Community (CE-IVD), in next-generation gene sequencing (NGS) (82-87). Analysis of ROS1 rearrangements is indicated in patients with ADC, CGC, ADC-mixed NSCLC and NAS (88-89): • the determination of Ros1 reassessments can be performed either on an operative specimen or on a bioptic or cytological sample of the primary tumour and/ or metastasis (88-9); • in patients suffering from ADC with a higher probability of Ross1 re-arrangement, i. e. non-smokers, weak smokers (< 15 packs/ year or ≤ 5 cigarettes per day) and ex-smoker (s) for 15 years prior to the initiation of cancer, an adequate molecular reference sample ≥ FISH-89 may be used for subsequent diagnostic determination. Initially, the reference diagnostic investigation for the determination of ROS1 rearrangements was FISH. In recent years, the evidence in support of the IHC method has increased, supporting this technique as a screening modality (90-91), but today, if a tumour sample is found to be positive in IHC, it would still need to be confirmed in FISH (92). For the FISH test, a cut-off of at least 15% of re-arranged neoplastic cells is indicated to be considered positive. In IHC it is possible to use several anti-ROS1 antibodies, including D4D6 (Cell Signaling Technology) and SP384 (Ventana) (93-94). Also in the case of the ROS1, it is currently possible to determine the specific molecular gene alteration of the NGS through the use of panels validated by the European Community for in vitro diagnostics (DIV-CE-93-95).",

Evaluation of PD-L1 expression should be performed by IHC with antibodies validated for samples fixed in formalin and included in paraffin. Cell-blocked cytological samples may also be used for the analysis of levels of PD - L1 expression as demonstrated by the latest evidence in the scientific literature (68, 97). Before performing the analysis in IHC, it is mandatory to assess the adequacy of the tumour sample. To date, the only quantitative parameter derived from the inclusion criteria of clinical trials is the number of neoplastic cells present, which must not be less than 100 live cells (97). In addition, for clone 263, a CE-IVD-labelled diagnostic kit validated on Benchmark XT or ULTRA (Ventana) is now commercially available, in relation to which the need for the PD-L1 test carried out in the clinical practice is the only way, the interpretation of the result on the BenchMark XT/ULTRA platform (Ventana) or the Clone 263 or 28-8 on the BENCHMARK XT /ULTra platform can also provide, prior internal validation of specific protocol, comparable results. The PD-L1 test report should contain the following information: • type of sample analysed; • protocol and platform used (with reference to the validation procedure if no CE-IVD diagnostic devices are used); • microscopic evaluation of the sample for the definition of suitability; • Proportion Score. It is essential to report positivity in relation to clinically relevant cut-offs (≥ 50% for treatment line I and ≥ 1% for treatment Line II). For the evaluation of molecular biomarkers approved in clinical practice in patients with advanced NSCLC, given the availability of material that is frequently limited compared to conventional technologies, the use of NGS is advisable, as it could allow the simultaneous analysis of multiple biomarks. In line with recent suggestions from the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), the use is also indicated in view of the increasing number of emerging predictive molecular biomarchers for which effective target therapies are available in the context of compassionate use/expanded access and/or clinical trial programmes (96). For which there are effective target therapies available in the context of compassionate use/expanded access programmes and/or clinical trials in Italy (96). Considering the steady growth in the number of predictive biomarker of therapeutic response that can be assessed in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and taking into account the need to identify all the specificities of any genetic alterations, obtaining greater amounts of neoplastic material, the appropriate conservation of tumour cells, the proper management of biological samples by dedicated pathologists, the use of methodologies capable of maximising outcomes even in the presence of small amounts of tumor tissue and the possible integration of circulating tumour DNA mutation analysis (98) represent key points in the international choices of the patient's diagnosis and care pathway. In accordance with the latest recommendations developed by AIOM, SIAPeC-IAP, SIF and SIBIOC on the performance of predictive tests on liquid biopsy, in well-defined clinical situations, when it is not possible to perform a tissue biopsy or when the insufficiency of the tumor tissue taken does not allow to finalize a complete and adequate molecular profiling, the evaluation of these molecular alterations on circulating tumor DNA can represent a valid alternative for the definition of the therapeutic strategy of ISC in patients with advanced NSCLC (Algorithm 2). However, it is appropriate to carry out such procedures in highly specialized centres, as also highlighted by the latest indications of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (98).",

      "text": "Following the initial formulation of a suspected diagnosis of lung cancer, it is essential to carefully reconstruct the clinical history (including smoking habits, comorbidities, weight loss, performance status, familiarity with neoplasms) and to carry out a thorough physical examination of the patient. The diagnostic phase and subsequent clinical staging require the rational use of currently available imaging methods and biopsy sampling techniques. If the suspicion of neoplasm has been based on a chest radiograph, further investigation by imaging should include a CT scan of the chest, upper abdomen and lower cervical region, in order to verify in the same seat the possible involvement of other organs, such as the liver, adrenal glands and suprarenal gland (90-100). In cases where CT does not indicate the presence of distant metastases, staging by imaging methods should be complemented by an 18F-FDG-PET examination (positron emission tomography with 18-deoxy-fluoroglucose associated with CT), which can be treated with curative intent from the beginning of the diagnostic process in clinically asymptomatic patients. However, this examination is recommended for diagnosis in all patients with metastatic disease and is required in all those with neurological signs and symptoms (99-100). the patient's operability should be checked in relation to his medical condition, in particular respiratory, cardiovascular and metabolic function (99-100). contrast medium CT (mdc) is the examination of choice for staging, as compared to other radiological examinations it is able to provide adequate information to the initial definition of the T, N and M parameters (with any complementary examinations) (99- 100). The variables to be assessed in the suspicion of neoplasia include: lesion size, shape, density and growth over time. The size of the neoplasm is closely related to the risk of malignancy, as well as the irregularity of the tumour. The mass density may be homogeneous or non-homogeneous and varies from deep lesions, to solid lesions with a directed or paramagnetically oriented pathway. In patients with high metastasis, an association of metastases can be demonstrated over time, adding to the increased risk of the same tumor. Extending the examination to the upper abdomen in the same session adds a modest expense and can identify metastases in about 10% of patients. However, the relative frequency of false positives or indeterminate CT results (mostly due to adrenal adenomas or liver cysts) sometimes requires further ascertainment with ultrasound and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, if doubt persists, a histological check, before excluding otherwise operable patients from surgical treatment. Extending CT examination with mdc also to the assessment of the lower abdomen is undoubtedly indicated in tumors involving SCLC histotype, as reported in the NCCN Guidelines (NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Small Cell Oncology). Lung Cancer, known as Metastatic RM Version, is the diagnostic method for the evaluation of the central nervous system. Small Cell Lung Cancer, Version MRI, as it is known, is the elective diagnostic test for the evaluation of metastatic involvement of the central nervous system. In particular, MRI of the brain with MDC is indicated as a diagnostic complement in the presence of a suspected metastasis to the CT scan of the cerebrum with mdC or, in the first instance, in patients with neurological symptomatology or in stages II-IV of NSCLC who are candidates for treatment for curative purposes or in the SCLC isotype where it would be preferable to CT, as reported in the NCCN Guidelines. However, these same Guidelines also consider brain MRI to be optional for patients with stage IB EGFR+ adenocarcinoma, in which a recent study in 1712 patients demonstrated a diagnostic yield of MRI in the identification of brain metastases of 6.9% compared to stage IA (0.5%) Regarding the diagnostic accuracy of CT in the assessment of mediastinal lymph node involvement, a systematic review published in 2013, which included over 7000 patients, reported a sensitivity of 55%, a specificity of 81%, a positive predictive power of 58% and a negative predictive force of 83% (102). Most of the studies in this review included a minimum diameter of 1 cm in the lumbar spine as the criteria for defining the radiological repercussion (102). This review considered a lymph node diameter greater than 1 cm in the minor axis as a criterion for defining the positivity of the radiological finding (102). False negatives to CT assessment are usually related to the presence of micrometastases in normally sized lymph nodes, whereas false positives are often caused by ongoing or recent bronchopneumonic processes and/or non-neoplastic lymphodal pathologies (e.g. granulomatose-like sarcoid reactions). PET-TC has assumed a significant role in both the diagnosis of solitary pulmonary nodule, and in the preoperative and post-treatment stages of lung cancer. PET-TC also makes it possible to localize the uptake of radiolabeled glucose, showing any dishomogeneity in the context of the pulmonary masses. This allows the biopsy to be directed to suspicious areas of tissue with high glucose metabolism, with a higher probability of reaching a diagnostic result. In addition, mediastinal staging with invasive methods (echoendoscopy and, if negative, mediasthinoscopy) is recommended by the ACCP and ESTS/ERS Guidelines, even in the case of mediastine lymph nodes negative to CT and PET-TC assessments, in the presence of some specific requirements (primary tumour sizes > 3 cm, central tumour, tumour with metastatic linear ilariolateral). patients may be excluded from the need for mediastinal staging with invasive methods in case of negative CT and PET-TC findings (111-112). The diagnostic-staging process of a lung cancer includes, as an integral part of the patient's health data, the radiological report, which can be drafted as a free-text report (FTR) or as a structured report (SR). There is agreement among the leading international scientific societies that reporting health data in a structure may improve patient outcome, and this also applies to the radiology report. According to the European Society of Radiology (ESR), the three reasons for switching from an FTR to an SR are: the quality, quantification and accessibility of the data. In particular, the use of a template in the SR provides a kind of check-list of characteristics and data to be assessed by the radiologist and, thanks to this 'structure', radiological data can be associated with clinical data in order to arrive at a more precise diagnosis, which is a key requirement for a more accurate personalised treatment. With regard to accessibility, the radiological record is also a source of data for research as it allows to extract data in an automated way, which can be used to validate the relevance of biomarker imaging in the clinical context or to process potential new domains. Therefore, the reference radiology should be contained in the standardised terminology and access mechanism and should be standardised in the radiology protocol. the radiological record should be structured in standardized content and terminology and should be accessible through standard access mechanisms and protocols. Despite the described advantages and promising developments, SR is not yet regularly used in clinical practice; the main reasons are the lack of usable templates and the poor availability of software solutions for SR. It is precisely in this direction that the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM) has moved, creating an SR template for the staging of lung cancer in order to guide radiologists in the systematic reporting of CT examinations and improve communication between members of the multidisciplinary team of radiologists and patients. The template includes several domains, Clinical data of the patient, ‡TD technical data, √Description of the requirements (TNM) and clusionality (NM) , which can be easily derived from the complexity of the work process and consultation with the public by using such a technology. 13",

      "heading": "3.2 Typing of the disease",
      "text": "The choice of the most appropriate invasive procedure for histological typing of the disease depends on the location (central or peripheral) of the primary tumour, the growth pattern relative to the airways (endobronchial vs peribronchical) and the possible presence of mediastinal and/or distant lymphoid metastases (114). Central tumours, either endoscopically visible or located in the proximal portion of the bronchial tree, are typed in most cases by bronchoscopy, with an overall diagnostic yield of approximately 90% (114-115). If the lesion has an endobronic/alechal extent, it is biopsied using standard flexible tweezers, or in the case of a surface with extensive necrotic appearance or submucosal infiltration, with transbronchial (TB) or crioscopic probes allowing material to be removed from the bronch deeply. or submucosal infiltration, with transbronchial needles (TBNA) or cryo-sondes that allow material to be taken deep from the lesion. Central tumors that do not have an extension within the airway (peri-bronchian/esophageal pattern), but which are located in the vicinity of a medium-large calibre airway or the esophagus, can be biopsied in real time by means of trans bronchial echoscandoscopy (EBUS, endobronchial ultrasound) or transesophagopea (EUS, endoscopic ultra-sound) (116-118). Diagnostic management of peripheral lesions, which are not visible by definition, is certainly more complex and variable, despite the current availability of very sophisticated methods (pre-ecomagnetic radiography, virtual electromagnetic navigation, bronchoscopic cones, CT scanning at the bronchoscope, robotic beam). The presence of the radiological sign known as bronchus sign (expression of a bronchus/bronchiole, which ends within the peripheral lesion), the size >2 cm and the solid pattern are among the most important positive predictive factors of the success of the bronchoscopic approach. The overall performance of broncoscopy in this setting, also using the most modern technologies of guidance to the sample, varies between 60% and 90% depending on the mode of guidance used (119-120), but with a single examination it is also possible to obtain stage information, the exclusion of central synchronous lesions and mediastinal potassium phonation, which are particularly important in the operable patient. The TC-guided transthoracic percutaneous approach (TTNA) is certainly much more effective (diagnostic yield of about 90%) than the endoscopic approach, in the face of a higher risk of pneumothorax (10-30% depending on the calibre of the needle used and the characteristics of the sampled lesions), in very peripheral lesion species, in lesions < 2 cm and in predominantly or exclusively vitreous smeared lesions The presence of potentially pathological adenopathies (dimensions > 1 cm TC or PET-TC positive) offers a very advantageous target for disease typing due to the high diagnostic success rate (> 90%) and the low rate of complications of the EU/US (EBS) and ESC in this setting. In addition to the staging information in the potentially operable patient, the ecoendoscopic approach is more advantageous in the patient with advanced disease with primary peripheral lesion, hence less readily achievable in bronchoscopy, and with a non-negligible risk of pneumothorax, when biopsied percutaneously (102, 122). Finally, in the advanced disease patient, CT and/or PET-TC examination sometimes allows the identification of suspected superficial metastases (e.g. lymph node lesions, parathyroid supraclavian, pleural vesicle) that can be sampled effectively and safely by external ultrasound, in a less invasive and simpler manner than for the patient (123-124). Finally, in the era of personalised therapy, it is absolutely essential that the professional performing the diagnostic procedure 'manages' the material collected according to a model, agreed with pathologists and molecular pathologists of the centre where he works, which allows to optimise the chances of obtaining from it both the correct histological typing and the molecular profile of the neoplasm (125-126).",

Endobronchial Ultra Sound (EBUS) allows the identification of the target and real-time observation of needle penetration, which allows a sensitivity of >90% to be achieved, even for small-sized lymphoid nodes. EBUS-TBNA is not capable of sampling non-airway-adjacent lymphoids (e.g. stations 8 and 9). The transesophageal (Endoscopic Ultra Sound, EUS) approach allows the sampling of left mediastinal (2L and 4L), sub-renal (7), bronchial peripheral and pulmonary ligament (8 and 9). Technical aspects of EBUS are recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the World Association of Interventional Pulmonology (ACIPWA). The procedure is to be performed under moderate or deep sedation, with a 21-22 gauge needle; tissue sampling to be carried out with or without rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE), however in the absence of ROSE a minimum of 3 separate passages of the needle is suggested to sample tissue; additional samples for molecular analysis are recommended (124-125, 127-128). According to the current guidelines of ACCP, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, European Respiratory Society and European Society of Thoracic Surgeons, LEBUS is indicated in all central tumors, tumors in peripheral lymph nodes >3 cm, also in PET cells >1 cm, and in PET Resonance Tissue <1 cm in PETS >1cm. In patients with potentially operable cN0/N1 disease, the scientific evidence suggests that mediastinal staging should be performed with systematic exploration of all mediastin stations by both transbronchial (EBUS) and transesophageal (EUS) routes; this approach in fact yields a sensitivity of the integrated use of EBUS-NATB/EUS of 93%, while the negative predictive value is 97% (129-130). This study, which enrolled 360 patients with potentially operable NSCLC, demonstrated the non-inferiority of endoscopic staging compared to surgical staging and suggests that confirmatory mediastinoscopy after negative ecoendoscope staging may be omitted in patients with resectable NSSCLC (131-132). Mediastinoscopia instead allows the assessment of parcheal, pretracheal and precarneal lymph node involvement. It provides for general anaesthesia and brief hospitalization. The use of video-mediastinoscope has decreased since the onset of NAUS-TB. Lymph node involvement N2/N3 in case of unavailable or inconclusive transbronchial or transesophageal endoscopic procedure (102). For completeness, it should be remembered that diagnostic videothoracoscopy (VATS) also allows biopsies to be performed in some inaccessible lymph node stations and pleural biopsies in the case of suspected metastatic lesions. In the staging of para-aortic and prevascular mediastinal lymph nodes, VATS is currently preferable to anterior mediastinotomy (128-129).",

A non-radical resection is associated with a survival comparable to that of non-operated patients. Surgery is not advisable in patients who, even with a limited lung lesion, show signs of advanced disease. Such an approach, in order to guarantee the patient the best level of care, must be performed in thoracic surgery centers with high experience, large volume and mixed houses. It has been widely demonstrated in the literature that surgical activity volumes are significantly correlated with a reduction in hospital mortality and post-surgical mortality. In the literature, surgical activity volumes are significantly correlated with a reduction in inpatient mortality and post-surgical mortality. The 5-year survival of patients treated in centres with high operative activity is also found to be higher than that of patients in low-operative centres (138). It has been clearly described as an exclusive thoracic surgery activity and its volume are the main determinants with regard to the survival outcomes of patients on major pulmonary resections: according to the European Guidelines the activity of a chest surgery should include a number of surgeries procedures exceeding 150±50 interventions/year (139-141). Finally, in a further study it was newly demonstrated that, compared to patients operated in a low centre, the risk of mortality volume showed a significant reduction and the number of progressive survival cases performed increased significantly (142). Therefore, in stage I, II NSCLC and in selected patients in stage IIIA/IIIB (T1-T3, N2 single station, non-bulky, assessed in multidisciplinary groups) surgical therapy should be proposed and performed exclusively at facilities with a high volume of activity, by specialized personnel with adequate experience. The operability criteria include: 1. biological operability (prospect of radicality in relation to the stage); 2. minor anatomical operable (possible resection of trauma, capable of achieving radicalization); 3. functional operable capacity (respiratory capacity after prior radical intervention, guaranteeing sufficient respiratory functionality). The most frequent perioperative complications are: atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias, atelectomy, pulmonary infections, prolonged air loss, ARDS, respiratory failure, bronchopulmonary fistula, embolism of the lung. The postoperative mortality for lobe fracturing is 2% and 5% and is related to the severity of the pre-respiratory conditions, the right lung morbidity and mortality rate is higher than that for chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis and pneumonia. The mortality rate is higher for pneumonectomy, with the right-hand side having higher early and late mortality and morbidity than the left.",

Lobectomy combined with ilo-mediastinal lymphadenectomy represents a standard surgical approach in lung cancer. The anatomical segment is acceptable only for patients with non-solid lesions at ground glass opacities (GGO) or for very early stages (Tis or T1a). In fact, lesions that present at the TAC as GGO often configure the presence of an indicated or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma in situ. Determining the prognosis of these tumors has made it possible to effectively avoid sub-lobular treatments with a very high percentage of surgically cured cases of lung cancer by means of lobe plasmoscopy or selective bronchoscopy (143). (sleeve lobectomy) or plastics of the pulmonary artery are indicated in selected cases and can effectively avoid pneumonectomy. In cases where the lesion is not amenable to lobectomies or in the presence of a significant transcutaneous obstruction, pneumo-nectomy is indicated, whenever it is feasible from a functional point of view. In patients with a significant functional deficit and a favorable lesion in size, stage and topography, it is possible to perform an anatomical sublobar resection (typical segmental resection) in combination with either mediastinal lymphadenectomy or at least systematic lymph node sampling (144). Robotic surgery has some limitations, including longer preparation times, higher costs, absence of tactile responses, need for dedicated equipment and staff training. Question 2. In patients with clinical stage I NSCLC, should lobectomy be performed with a minimally invasive or thoracotomic approach? A meta-analysis of randomised and non-randomised trials (148) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mini-invasive lobectomies found no statistically significant differences between minimally- invasive lobes and thoracocytes in terms of premature mortality (<0.49 mmol/l), post-percutaneous peritoneal loss (< 0.09) and pulmonary arterial hypertension. The ACCP guidelines report equivalent long-term survival, lower perioperative mortality, fewer complications, and shorter degeneration in favor of the mini-invasive lobectomy (150). Limits: Studies are limited by nature (non-randomized retrospectives) and it is possible that the collection of complications is incomplete. Benefit/harm balance: There are several implications based on these conclusions. First, the factors responsible for the advantages of the minimally invasive approach should be analyzed. Although there is a presumption that this may lead to an increased cost of pain, this has not been demonstrated experimentally. Moreover, although postoperative pain may affect some outcome variables, there may be other more important factors that affect the greater percentage of patients without complications.

RECOMMENDATION: In patients who have early-stadium NSCLL (IA) anatomic segmentateptomy may be considered as a first-choice surgical treatment compared with lobectomies. Strength of recommendation: CONDITIONED IN FAVOR Motivations/comments to the benefit/harm balance: In early-step NSCLLC patients, segmentalctomy does not appear to result in any difference in terms of overall survival and disease-free survival compared to lobiectomy, but segmentalctectomy did result in a reduction in the number of benefit outcomes. The JCOG080W2/JOG460L7 multicenter, randomized, controlled phase III study compared segmental survival with peripheral lobectomia in the treatment of small segmental lymph nodes (151). The subsequent randomised controlled trial CALGB 140503 demonstrated equal efficacy of sublobar resections (atypical segmentatectomy or anatomical segmentectomy) in T1a N0 NSCLC (152). Based on this evidence, anatomic (typical) segmentateptomy can be considered as one of the possible surgical approaches for stage IA NSSCLC, in addition to, of course, lobectomy. However, unlike lobectomies, for which few technical variations have been described, segmentatects present a plethora of different procedures and may include different technical aspects that complicate the homogenization of results. Therefore, the adoption of segmentalctomy as a new standard of care still remains controversial. Therefore, the adoption of segmentectomy as a new standard of care is still controversial. Overall benefit/harm balance: In patients with early-stage NSCLC (IA), typical segmentatectomy versus lobectomy is likely associated with a higher rate of local recurrence, but no difference in terms of postoperative complications (e.g., air leakage). Quality of evidence The quality of evidence was judged to be overall MODERATE. The certainty of the evidence was lowered due to heterogeneity among the studies, risk of selection bias considering the observational nature of the studies (which were judged overall to be of average quality through the New Ottawa Scale), for publication and risk of performance bias.",

In patients who cannot be operated for the presence of clinically significant comorbidities, medical contraindikations, or who refuse surgery, and especially in elderly patients, a valid alternative to surgery is radiation therapy. The publication of the CHISEL study (153), which compared SBRT to conventional radiotherapy in a randomised phase III study, reported reduced local disease progression (14% vs 33%) in favour of stereotactic treatment and a favourable toxicity profile. For over a decade, the introduction of this technique has been associated with a reduction in the percentage of patients, generally elderly, who were not undergoing any active cancer treatment because they were not internally suitable (38% in 1999-2001 to 26% in 2005-2007). A total of 17,973 patients in 17 studies were included in the work (SBRT 7395; RTC 10,578).

In the absence of work that has completed the planned enrolment, the use of stereotaxis is not recommended outside a clinical trial. Two of the three randomised trials initiated in this subgroup of patients were discontinued due to low accrual and did not reach the statistical power necessary for a direct comparison between the two therapeotic modalities. The 2015 pooled analysis (157) reported favourable data for stereotaxia in terms of clinical outcomes and toxicity; however, while stereotaxy is a potentially effective option in operable patients, it is certainly desirable that further studies are conducted and eventually completed, so as to overcome the limits of low numbers and short follow-up. In this regard, the randomised prospective study VALOR (Veterans Affairs Lung cancer surgery Or stereotactic Radiotherapy) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02984761) is currently underway, which provides for the enrollment of 670 patients with early-stage operable disease, the results of which will be available in 2027. A meta-analysis of studies published in the literature and based on the propensity score, which can be defined as a tool for reducing the influence of selection bias (158), was conducted in 2018. This work included 16 studies, for a total of 19,882 patients. The survival rate in patients undergoing surgery (sublobectomy or resectable surgery) was significantly higher than that in the two treatment groups (ICR = 1.50; ICR = 0.98; IHR = 1.28,262; IHR= 0.95%; IC = 1.85; IC= 1.28,96%). In order to interpret the difference between overall survival (OS) and tumour-related survivorship (DSS), the authors themselves confirm the need for prospective data to assess potential non-cancer-related causes of death. This difference between OS and DSS could be due to residual imbalances in baseline characteristics caused by covariates not measured or not selected during the propensity score analysis, or insufficiency to detect a difference in DSS potency, or still long-term toxicity.

Of these, 31 were excluded for the following reasons: 7 for lack of comparison, 11 published as an abstract, 13 for unsuitable PICO. 19 studies were therefore included (2 metanalyses, 16 RCTs and 1 observational study). Pignon et al. in 2008 published the LACE (Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation) meta-analysis, which included individual data from 5 phase III studies, which randomised patients with stage I-IIIA cisplatin-based combinations to receive chemotherapy vs observation (159). This meta-analysis reports a HR of 0.89 (IC95% 0.82-0.96; p=0.005), which corresponds to an absolute benefit in 5-year survival of 5.4%, in favour of adjuvant chemotherapy. The benefit varies in relation to the stage of disease at diagnosis with an HR of 1.40 (95% CI 0.95-2.06) for stage IA; 0.93 (95% IC 0.78-1.10) for stage IB; 0.83 (IC 95% 0.73-0.95) for stages II and III. Even in terms of disease-free survival from adjuvants alone, the resulting benefit from surgery is greater than a 5.4% absolute benefit at 5 years (IC < 0.84-90.001; HR < 0.91) and 0.78% for stage I. Burdett et al. in 2015 published another meta-analysis conducted on individual data from 8447 patients enrolled in 26 randomised trials. This meta-analyse further confirmed the overall survival advantage in favour of adjuvant chemotherapy compared to surgery alone, with a HR of 0.86 (95% CI 0.78-0.91; p < 0.001) and an absolute benefit of 5.8% at 5 years. Grade 3-4 toxicity was overall 66%, with grade 3 neutropenia found in 9% and grade 4 in 28% of cases. After a median follow-up of 74 months, there was no difference in survival between the two treatment arms, with a HR of 0.83 (IC95% 0.64-1.08; p=0.12) (161). However, an exploratory analysis of the same study indicated a benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in terms of overall survival (HR 0.69; IC90% 0.48-0.99; p = 0.04) and disease-free survival (0.69; CI 0.90%-0.49-97; p= 0.03) in patients with stage IB tumours ≥ 4 cm in diameter. Based on these data, the main International Guidelines (163-164) suggest considering adjuvant chemotherapy in stage IB (seventh edition of TNM staging) with tumors > 4 cm in size, however assessing the risk/benefit ratio of this approach for an individual patient. Regarding the timing of the start of adjunctive treatment, all randomised trials enrolled patients no later than 8 weeks after surgery. Salazar et al. in 2017 conducted a retrospective observational study of 12,473 patients with radically operated stage I-IIIA NSCLC, demonstrating how adjuvative chemotherapies are potentially effective, even when administered up to 18 months after surgery alone. In addition, a significant interaction between patient performance status and benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in terms of overall survival (p=0.01) and disease-free survival was reported for the studies included in the LACE meta-analysis (159). In the light of the above, the main International Guidelines suggest that cisplatin-based chemo-therapy for 4 treatment cycles should be offered to patients with radically operated, Stage II-III NSCLC with performance status of 0-1, no significant comorbidities, and who have had good physical recovery after surgery (163,166). Overall, considering the limitations of the evidence (especially the availability of only data from non-elderly studies), the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in elderly patients remains to be defined, although in well-selected cases this approach should not be precluded. The data in the population ≥75 years old are very limited, as few patients ≥70 years old were included in clinical trials; therefore, the choice of treatment in this age group should always be made with extreme caution (167-168). The role of carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimens was evaluated in 3 phase III studies (161, operated on stage IB (T2N0) (161), Ou et al. published the results of a phase III study, in which 150 patients with radically operated NSCLC in stage IIIA (N2) were randomised to carboplattin-containing chemotherapeutic treatment in combination with paclitaxel or vinorelbine vs single observation. disease-free was 32 (IC95% 21.3-42.7) vs 20 (IC95 13.1-26.9) months, respectively (p=0.02) (169). Both studies, burdened with grade 3-4 neutropenia in 35-40% of cases, did not reach the planned number of patients and were closed early due to slow enrollment. Finally, Felip et al. reported the results of a phase III study in which 420 patients with radically operated NSCLC in stage IA, IB, II or T3N1 (VII edition TNM) were randomized to surgery alone or surgery followed by carboplatin- and paclitaxel-based chemotherapy. After a median follow-up of 51 months, no significant difference in overall survival was observed (HR=1.09; IC92-1.65%; p=0.65; disease free survival=0.95%; IC=0.72; p=1.96; disease free IC= 0.722). However, only 66% of patients who underwent surgery subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy treatment, so the study was not powerful enough to demonstrate significant differences between the two arms (170). The most frequently used adjunctive therapy combinations in the studies included in the meta-analyses include cisplatin + vinorelbine, or vindesinin, or vinblastin, or etoposide-based doubles, or triplets with cis platin + mitomycin + vindesindin, or Vinblastine and ifosfamide (159-160). However, the only combination containing a third-generation drug and used as the only adjuvant chemotherapy regimen in at least 2 randomised trials (171-172) of the LACE meta-analysis is the cisplatin + vinorelbine dual. A phase II study that had as its primary endpoint tolerability (defined as no grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia for more than 7 days or no febrile grade 3 or 4 non-haematological toxicity related to chemotherapeutic therapy) randomized 130 patients with radically operated NSCLC (non-squamous histology) (stadium IB, pT3 or IINM1, edition VII) to receive a combination of cisplatine + pemetrexed vs vinorelin. At a median follow-up of approximately 4 months, the tolerability of adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly better for patients receiving the combination of cisplatin + pemetrexed compared to cisplatine + vinorelbine (95.5%; 95% CI 87.5-99.1 vs 75.4%; 95% IC 63.1-85.2; p=0.001) (173). At a Median follow up of 39 months, there was no difference between the two adjuvants regimens in the secondary endpoints of recurrence-free survival (0.83: 95% CI 0.31-2.17; p=1.07) or overall survival (HR 0.59; IC 0.9-2.161; p=40.5%). (174) Similarly, a multi-centre Phase III (JIPANG) study conducted in Japan, in which 784 patients with radically operated NSCLC (non-squamous histology) (Stage II-III, TNM VII edition) were randomised to receive cisplatin + pemetrexed vs. However, Grade 3 and 4 haematological toxicities were less frequent in the experimental arm (cisplatin + pemetrexed: 24.7%) than in the standard arm (cyplatin+ vinorelbine: 81.8%) Limits: Overall, for the recommendation on the role of adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin-based regimens in patients with radically operated stage II-III NSCLC, the quality of the evidence was considered high. Indeed, the LACE meta-analysis included studies at low risk of bias (performance bias due to absence of influence, not blinding as primary outcome) and no limitations were found for the precision (number of patients), directness and consistency among other findings, such as that of the Burdett ethnographic analysis (LACE). [159] directness and consistency (corresponding results between the LACE meta-analysis [159] and other metanalyses, such as that of Burdett et al. [160]). Regarding the recommendation on the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage I, the quality of the evidence was assessed as moderate, due to the poor accuracy (small number of patients and wide confidence intervals) and the low consistentness of the results (discordant data between the Lace meta-Analysis[159] and the Burdett and al. meta-ANALYS [160]. With regard to the recommended role of clinical additive chemotherapies for stage II tumours >4 cm in size, the quality of evidence was rated as mild because of the risk of imprecision due to reduced patient numbers and a risk of bias due to many of the studies on this stage II outcome being obtained from subgroups analysed in unplanned ways. Similarly, the inclusion of patients in the older studies (70-75 years) with cisplatin therapy was also assessed on the basis of moderate evidence), due to a reduced role of chemotherapeutic regulation. The quality of the evidence regarding the recommendation on carboplatin-based chemotherapy in radically operated stage II-III NSCLC was judged moderate due to the risk of selection bias or the low statistical power of some studies (Ou et al. 2010 [169], for example, was closed prematurely). Regarding the recommendations on the use of adiu chemotherapeutic with cisplatin and vinorelbine in patients with radicallyoperated stage III-IINSCLC the quality of evidence was rated high, due to low risk and good accuracy, consistency and directness of the studies that evaluated carboplatin based chemotherapies (Winton et al., 2005) [171]; the adjuvant treatment ratio for patients aged <75 years was assessed in favour of cisplatino et al.[172] Compatibility/benefit balance sheet: 2006 B no. For Stage I, the ratio is in favour of observation, while for the population aged > 75 years there are limited data. In patients with radically operated NSCLC in stage II-III and well selected (good performance status, no major concomitant pathologies, with good and rapid postoperative recovery) adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin-based regimens should be considered as a first choice therapeutic option (167) In patients affected by radically-operated N SCLC in the stage I treatment regimen adjunctive chemotherapies should not be considered to be a first-choice therapy option (168) In patients treated with radiation-induced NSCLL in the stages II (A > 4 cm) and well-selected (platinum-free, with no major comorbidities, with a good post-operative status, with fast and rapid post-op recovery) patients with cytoplasmic cancer in the second-stage (70-75 years of age) and non-operatively selected (cysplatin based) regimen may be considered for re-treatment as a second choice theraphypeutic regimen (167) adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin-based regimens should not be considered as a first-line treatment option (161, 169-170) In patients with well-selected (good performance status, no major co-morbidities, with good and rapid postoperative recovery) radically operated stage II-III NSCLC, cisplatin- and vinorelbine-based adjunctive chemotherapeutic regimen may be considered for first line treatment. However, if patient-related or structural reasons preclude the use of this combination, any Cisplatin regimen with which the physician is familiar may be appropriate.",

Of these, 5 were excluded for non-interested population. 2 studies were included. The data available to date to assess the role of adjuvant radiotherapy in radically operated stages I-II come from constantly updated meta-analyses, the first of which was published in 1998 (192) and the most recent in 2016 (193). Eligible studies included patients radically operated for NSCLC in pathological stage I-III (including therefore pN2, patients not covered by the present analysis), or undergoing radiation therapy. The outcomes analysed include overall survival, recurrence-free survival and local and remote recurrence free survival. The results confirmed the results of the previous meta-analyses, reporting a worsening of survival in patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy, with 1.18 (IC95% 1.07-1.31) or an increased risk of death equal to 18%. This data translates into a detrimental effect of 5% at 2 years (95% IC9 2-9) in patients receiving radiation therapy, reducing survival from 58% overall to 53% LHR. a 1.10 (IC95% 0.99-1.21), suggests a potentially negative effect of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) (p=0.07). Analysis of locoregional and distance recurrence-free survival reveals a benefit in favor of surgery alone (HR 1.12 [IC95%, 1.01-1.24] and HR 1.13 [IC95%, 1.02-1.24], respectively). The most surprising figure is that of the survival free from locorregional recurrence. As the authors themselves suggest, the number of locorregional recurrences is lower in patients treated with PORT. However, since death is the event that most represents the observed events, the final results are largely attributable to survival. This suggests that radiotherapeutic therapy may reduce recurrent death events and the increased risk of death that could be attributed to other mechanisms. suggests that radiotherapy may reduce relapse events and that the increased risk of death may be attributable to other mechanisms. Unlike previous meta-analyses, in which PORT was more harmful in early stages and in patients with less lymph node involvement, this observation loses statistical significance in this latest work, in Which the analysis was conducted after updating the TNM. The authors also suggest that, despite the inclusion of a greater number of works, the new methodology applied resulted in the exclusion of trials dedicated to a specific stage, resulting in a limitation in the power of detection of such differences. use of technically unsuitable equipment for thoracic irradiation, inadequate treatment volumes and radiotherapy planning. Benefit/harm balance: These studies, although with the above limitations, show a detrimental effect of postoperative radiation therapy on the overall survival of patients with radically operated Stage I-II NSCLC. For these reasons the benefit-harm ratio appears unfavourable.

However, it seems reasonable to suggest the periodic performance of a thoracic CT with mdc for patients potentially susceptible of subsequent active therapy. After the first 2 years CT can be performed without contrast medium, in the absence of doubtful or suspicious lesions. There are selected patient populations for which bronchoscopic surveillance could be useful: these include patients with central neoplasms, visible on diagnostic bronchoscope, patients at high risk of recurrence of the coccyx (surgical margins <1 cm), and patients with bronchial sediments of dysplasia or carcinoma in situ. In these patients, the percentage of asymptomatic recurrences of the moncone evidenced with a broncoscopy performed 1 year after the intervention is of the order of 4% (199). Although no data are available on the survival benefit, the performance of a bronkoscopy 1 year before the intervention in this group of patients may be recommended. Patients were randomized to a defined minimal follow-up, which consisted of clinical visits and chest X-rays semi-annually for the first 2 years and then annually, up to 5 years from surgery, and a maximal clinical follow up, which included clinical visit and chest/abdominal CT with mdc also semi-yearly for the 1st 2 years, and then yearly until 5 years.

Stages IIIA-IIIB represent a heterogeneous group, since they include clinical scenarios that are profoundly different from each other both in prognostic and therapeutic terms: IIIA (T3-T4, N1; T1-T2, N2); IIIB (T3 -T4, n2; T1- T2, N3). In fact, if the treatment of the majority of patients with N1 disease can be assimilated to that of early stages, and the management of most patients with disease N3 can be equated with that of stage IIIC, management of N2 disease is more complex and varied. In this case, in fact, the prognosis certainly differs if it concerns only the colonization of a single lymph nodes in the lymph system or if there is a more widespread spread of staphylococcus (4R5), or if the disease is spread. In particular, patients with resectable cN2 disease are those with T1-T3 and a metastatic involvement of a single mediastinal station at the favorable site, not bulky. To define this condition, preoperative invasive pathological confirmation and negative pathological staging on the other mediastin stations are required. Several options are allowed in these conditions: • surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy; • neoadjuvant chemo-therapy followed by surgery; • Neoadjuvent chemoradiation followed by surgical intervention. Different therapeutic options should always be evaluated within a multidisciplinary expert group, with the objective of identifying the most appropriate dose-based strategy for each patient with multiple disease at the favourable site, rather than at the target site. In very selected cases, clinical-radiological downstaging obtained with induction therapies (chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy) and documented by cyto-histological examination may allow for a surgical indication, however this should always be shared in a multidisciplinary setting. The efficacy of surgery versus radiotherapy in patients in Stage IIIA-N2 in response to chemotherapy induction was assessed in a study sponsored by EORTC, to better define the best locoregional approach in this setting (204). Surgery did not provide a significant benefit in terms of 5-year survival compared to radiation therapy. Among the major limitations of both studies is the clinical heterogeneity of patients enrolled within stage IIIA-N2, which does not allow drawing univocal conclusions in the different subgroups analysed. No significant differences in terms of effectiveness between the different treatment strategies (surgery vs radiotherapy) appear to emerge; however, pneumonectomy, especially right lung, after induction therapy is still burdened with significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, in cases where a lobectomy was not possible, it is recommended that chemotherapy be followed by induction radiation therapy for curative purposes.",

In the subgroup analysis the evaluation of the effectiveness of neoadjuvant treatment in relation to the extent of the disease is not relevant, as the study sample of included patients is not representative of the different stages of NSCLC that could be included into the criteria of the analysis (BIA and IBIA stages II enrolments), which results in a low or moderate proportion of patients in terms of heterogeneity (207). Zhang et al. (207) reports limitations in terms of heterogeneity of included studies, some of which are reported to be of low or moderate quality. The results of the stage-stratified analysis are not highlighted, because most of the studies do not report patient data in relation to the specific disease stage.

Benefit/ harm balance: An important aspect to consider is the tolerability profile of neoadjuvant treatments, which is acceptable in individual studies, with mild to moderate toxicity reported. On the basis of the available evidence, despite the fact that chemotherapy does not currently represent the first choice of treatment strategy in patients with NLCIA in the current disease stage, patients should be re-evaluated as part of a valid multi-disciplinary treatment strategy with NSCIA in Stage II (IBM) instead of Stage VIII (NSCII) and should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary Group II (NIBM2) instead.

Despite a non-different overall survival, the data clearly show that in patients undergoing pulmonary lobectomy the survival advantage in favour of the trimodale strategy compared to definitive chemo-radio is significant (median OS 34 months vs. 22 months). This benefit is not found in the group treated with pneumonectomy (medan OS 19 months), thus highlighting the need for a correct selection of the patient candidate for treatment. When radiotherapy is used sequentially with respect to chemotherapy in the induction strategy, as in the work of the SAKK Group, no survival benefit is observed from the trimodal strategy compared to the standard induction-surgery approach (209). Complete pathological response and lymph node clearance (pN0) are attested in the randomized studies cited between 15 and 33% and between 25 and 46%, respectively.

The 1998 PORT (Post-Operative Radio-Therapy) meta-analysis, while demonstrating a negative effect on survival in patients radically resected in stages I-II, does not clarify the existence of a clinical benefit in patients in stage III (217). Although some methodological criticisms concerning this meta-analyse are justified (inclusion of predominantly highly dated studies, conducted with different total doses, radiobiologically non-optimal fractionation schemes, use of technically unsuitable equipment for thoracic irradiation, treatment planning and non-randomized radiotherapeutic treatment), there is no scientific evidence to date in favour of additive radiotherapies. treatment volumes and radiotherapy planning are not congruent), to date there is no randomised scientific evidence in favour of adjuvant radiotherapeutic treatment. In any case, treatment must now provide for the administration of a total dose of between 50 Gy and 54 Gy, with conventional fractionation (1.8 - 2 Gy/day), to a target volume represented by the ilio-mediastinal lymph stations involved in the disease, from the section tranche always considering the lilo and the subcarinal station (218). The use of increasingly conformed radiation therapy techniques allows to minimize the risk of acute and late complications, both respiratory type, and at the expense of other organs at risk, such as the heart and esophagus. In 2014 a literature-based meta-analysis assessed the impact of PORT on survival and recovery of the disease in 2387 patients randomly enrolled in the local radiation study in stage II-NIA (2192). PORT reduced the risk of local disease recurrence and improvement in survival was reported when radiotherapy was administered by linear accelerator (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.61-0.95; p=0.02). In 2016, a further meta-analysis evaluated 16 randomised trials for a total of 3278 patients undergoing radical surgery in stage IIIA-N2 (220). The data confirm an advantage in favour of PORT in terms of survival with an absolute benefit at 5 years of 8% (HR 0.73; IC 0.58-9.5%; p = 0.008), with improved disease free survival (HR 0,70; IC 0.960-0.83%; p<0,0001) and from local to regional (IC 0.37-0.58; p<0.0001) to regional. A meta-analysis published in 2019 also confirms that PORT increases survival (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.79-0.92) and disease-free survivorship (HR 0.57; 95% IC 0.38-0.85) in patients with multiple disease-involved lymph nodes, while it is not evident for patients with single N2 station involvement (221). However, the results produced suggest the benefit of postoperative radiotherapy in stage III pN2. At ESMO 2020, the results of the LungART trial (NCT00410683) were presented for the first time, a prospective randomized European study aimed at evaluating the usefulness of adjuvant radiation therapy in patients undergoing radical surgical resection with pathological evidence of involvement of mediastinal lymphoid stations (pN2) (222). The study, following a reduction in sample size and targets, enrolled 501 patients, demonstrating a non-significant increase in DFS at 3 years (43.8% in the control arm vs 47.1% in the experimental arm), with a decrease in mediastine recurrences of 46.1% to 25% in favor of PORT safety. The survival by 3 years is equal to 68.5% in the OST group and 66.5% in control group. The advantage of DFS appears to be mostly due to the absence of treatment. The study reported higher rates of mainly cardiopulmonary complications in the experimental arm (16.2% vs 2%) as well as an increase in G3-G4 toxicities (23.7% vs 15%), with a death rate of 5.3% in the control arm and 14.6% in the trial arm, such as not to allow the recommendation of postoperative radiotherapy in all patients undergoing surgery in stage IIIA (pN2). Some subsequent analyses documented that for 18% of patients the median irradiated volume was more extensive than expected and that the deviations from the protocol for target coverage, smaller and larger, were equal to 13% and 32% of the total, respectively. In fact, while for tumors located on the left, in addition to stations 7 and 4L, the station 4R (contralateral) is also involved in 37% of cases, for tumours localized on the right the reshoots are exclusively subcarnal and omolateral. This significantly influences the definition of the target volume. The extent of lymph node involvement is also a prognostic factor for overall survival.Identification of these prognosis factors and awareness of treatment-related toxicities could lead to a personalised prescription of adjuvant radiotherapy in this patient setting.",

      "text": "Multimodal treatment is indicated in all patients with unresectable stage IIIA/ IIIB or IIIC NSCLC, which should always be evaluated and shared in a multidisciplinary setting. In patients with stage IIIB (N3) or IIC NSCLL it is recommended to proceed in the first instance with molecular characterisation of the tumour involving, as in stage IV, the search for EGFR mutations, ALK and ROS1 rearrangements, to assess the possibility of prescribing targeted molecular treatments in populations selected for the presence or expression of these markers. A 2004 Cochrane meta-analysis compared concomitant chemoradiotherapy with both sequential and radiation-only treatment (226). 3 randomised prospective trials, 2 Phase III and 1 Phase II, were analysed for a total of 711 patients with stage II-IIIB NSCLC. It was demonstrated that the concomitant chemoradio-therapy approach resulted in a reduction in the 2-year risk of death of 14% compared to the sequential approach. The updated Cochrane meta-analysis (227) provides more mature data than the previously assessed studies, with the inclusion of additional trials. Altogether, 6 randomised prospective studies (1024 patients) were analysed, comparing concomitant chemoradiotherapy treatment with the sequential mode. A difference in 2-year risk of death was shown in the two groups of 13%, similar to that reported in the 2004 meta-Analysis of survival for the etranabstract study alone. A significant benefit of concomitant treatment was reported both in terms of overall survival (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.62-0.89; 702 patients) and 2-year survival rate (RR 0.87; 95% IC 0.78-0.97; 937 patients).Although not statistically significant, an increase in treatment-related mortality (4% vs. 2%) was confirmed, as was an increased incidence of severe esophageal disease (R R 4.96; 95% CI 2.17-11.37; 947 patients) to the detriment of the co-concomitant arm.Another meta-analysis (228) compared the strategy of co-treatment vs. sequential treatment in this setting. Concomitant treatment is associated with an improvement in survival (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.74-0.95; p=0.004), with an absolute benefit of 5.7% at 3 years and 4.5% at 5 years. It is also highlighted that the effect of concomitant therapy is most explicit in local disease control (HR 0,77; 95% IC 0.62-0.95) while there are no differences in the two groups with respect to distance progression. From the study subgroup analysis, no clinical characteristics (age, sex, PS, stage, histology) could emerge correlated to the survival benefit obtained from concomitent treatment. The most relevant concomitance bias is represented by the acute arm of the included studies, which show a moderate degree of risk (22-18%, 3-4, 4%) and a degree of confidence (22-18%) in the overall condition. studies included in the meta-analysis (227) show a moderate overall risk of selection and attrition bias, which may affect confidence in the results obtained. With regard to the assessment of the risk of bias, in 3 of the studies contained in the Meta-Analysis (228), a complete analysis of the selection bias is not possible. In addition, the study of Furuse et al. had been excluded from the Cochrane meta-analyse for a slight deformity in the radiotherapy treatment schedule (10 days of pause expected in concomitant treatment vs. continuous mode in sequential), while that of Ulutin et al was similarly excluded as it was not randomised and with a limited number. Benefit/ harm balance: The number of trials and patients included in this analysis, together with the survival benefit, support a clinical benefit in favour of concomitent treatment. The number of trials and patients included in the analysis, together with the reported survival benefit, support a clinical benefit in favour of concomitant treatment. Overall quality Strength of clinical trial recommendation Recommendation In patients with stage IIIA/ IIIB unresectable NSCLC, or IIIC, in good general condition (ECOG PS 0-1) moderate concomitance chemoradiotherapy at radical doses Strongly in favour should be considered as the first-line treatment option (226-228)",

Of these, 15 were excluded for the following reasons: 9 for different PICO, 3 for study design and 3 for lack of comparison. Therefore, 6 studies (2 systematic reviews and 4 RCTs) were included. The identification of the chemotherapy regimen to be associated with radiation treatment in stage IIIA/IIIB non-resectable NSCLC, or IIIC, remains a question of debate in the research of the best therapeutic strategy today. Results from 2948 patients included in 8 selected clinical trials showed that cisplatin-based combinations resulted in a significant improvement in the objective response rate (ORR) (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.15-1.61; p < 0.001) but no prolongation of survival, compared to a carboplatin- based regimen (HR 1.10; 95% CI 1,005-1,21; p=0.39). However, a subsequent analysis excluding the 3 trials involving combinations with obsolete medicinal products (mitomycin, C-desin, vinblastine), considering only the 5 studies involving third-generation drugs (taximetaplatin or gemcitabine), showed a statistically significant advantage in overall survival compared to cisplatins-based regimens, in favour of a net increase of 11%. As with metastatic disease, two Phase III studies (230-231) confirmed that combinations of cisplatin and third generation drugs (paclitaxel or docetaxel) are more effective and less toxic than previous chemotherapy regimens including second generation drugs such as irinotecan, vindesine or mitomycin. The results showed no significant differences in overall survival (20.5, 19.8 and 22 months, respectively) and 5-year survival (17.5%, 17.8% and 19.8%, respectively), between the 3 treatment arms, but confirmed a worse tolerability profile, compounded by a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia and gastroenteric disorders, for the combination of mitomycin, taliesin and cisplatin (these results were confirmed by the study by Segawa et al. published in 2010, in which the combination based on mitomicin, cisplatine and vindesin was compared with cisplatino and docetaxel, in combination with concomitant radiotherapy). The results confirmed a statistically non-significant difference in favour of the cisplatin-docetaxel combination in terms of ORR: 78.8% (95% CI 69.4-86.4) vs 70.3% (95% IC 60.4-79); 2-year survival rate: 60.3% vs 48.1% (p=0.059); progression-free survival (PFS): 13.4 vs 10.5 months (p = 0.208) and overall (OS) survival: 26.8 months (95% CI 23.6-33.4) vs 23.7 months (IC 95% 15.9-33.2), respectively (231). A systematic review of studies evaluating concomitant chemoradiotherapy with carboplatin-paclitaxel or cisplatin-etoposide regimens in patients with inoperable Stage III NSCLC did not reveal significant differences in efficacy, with a 3-year survival rate of 31% in the Cisplatin etoposide arm vs 25% in the Carboplatin and Paclitaxel arm (p=0.50). However, the cisplatin-etoposide combination resulted in a significant increase in the 3-year survival rate (3-years OS rate): 41% vs 26% (p=0.024) compared to the carboplatin-pacxel combination. From the comparison, an overlapping tolerability profile emerged between the 2 regimens, with an increase in radiotherapy-associated exposure in the Cisplatin and etoposide arms (ORR 73.7% vs 64.5% [p = 0.21]) and OS (23.3 months vs 20.7 months [HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.55-1.05; p=0.095]), respectively. The study, which included 555 patients, was discontinued early for futility, showing a similar survival benefit between the 2 treatment arms (OS: 26.8 vs 25.8 months; HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.79-1,20; p=0.831), but confirming a significant reduction in grade 3 and 4 toxicity in favor of the cisplatin and pemetrexed combination (66.4% vs. 76.008%; P=0.001). Limitations: Imprecision of estimates for some outcomes. Benefit/harm balance: In the light of the evidence described, the benefit/ harm balance appears to favour platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy, in patients with unresectable stage IIIA/IIIB or IIIC NSCLC. Overall quality Strength of clinical trial recommendation Recommendation In patients with an unresettable stage IIIIA/IB II, or IIC, platinum based chemotherapies should be considered Moderate Strong in favour of platinum as a first-line therapeutic option in conjunction with radiation therapy (229-234)",

The Phase III PACIFIC study is a double-blind, multicentre, randomised trial, which enrolled 713 patients with performance status 0-1, with locally advanced NSCLC (stage III not resectable according to TNM VII edition), in response to or disease stability after concomitant chemoradiotherapy treatment (at least 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy concurrent with radiotherapy) with intentional radiation (total radiation therapy doses between 54 and 66). At the first scheduled interim analysis, PFS was significantly higher in durvalumab-treated patients compared to placebo (median PFS 16.8 months vs. 5.6 months; HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.42-0.65; p=0.001). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were only slightly more frequent in the dur valumab arm (29.9% vs. 26.1%), as well as adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation (15.4% vs. 9.8%) (235). After a median follow-up of 25.2 months, overall survival in the general population was in favor of durvalume immunotherapy with HROS (medan duration not reached 28.00 months; IC 0.61-0.008; 0.95% vs. 55.005; PFS = 0.36 years); as was the survival rate at 55.002 years (IC 0.81-0.95%; PFS=0.63; PHR 0.63-0.93%). A pre-planned subgroup analysis initially demonstrated a survival advantage in favor of durvalumab independent of PD-L1 expression levels at the predetermined cut-off of 25%, as measured on archival tissue, available in approximately 63% of patients: cutoff ≥25% (HR 0.46) and cut- off < 25% (HR 0,92). Based on these data, durvalomab was approved by the FDA as a consolidation therapy in patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC, or disease stability in response to dose-based chemoradiotherapy, irrespective of tumour PD1-L expression levels. A subsequent unplanned post-hoc exploratory analysis, requested by the European Regulatory Authorities (CHMP), aimed at exploring the predictive role of PD-L1 at a different cut-off than the prescribed one (cut-off: 1% vs. 25%), however, showed a significant correlation between PD- L1 expression levels and survival benefit in durvalumab-treated patients: cut off ≥1% (HR 0.53) and cut- off < 1% (HR 1.36). The 4-year study update confirms a clinically relevant and long-lasting survival benefit in durvalumab-treated patients with a median OS of 47.5 months, achieved for the first time, compared to 29.1 months in the control arm (HR 0.71; 95% IC 0.57-0.88) and a PFS of 35.3% vs 19.5%, respectively.",

      "text": "Hellman and Weichselbaum in 1995 first proposed the definition of oligometastatic disease (241). 20-50% of patients with metastatic NSCLC have oligometostatic disease (OM) at diagnosis, and this percentage is increasing mainly due to advances in imaging techniques. It has been observed that low-load metistatic disease has a better prognosis and that local ablative treatment (LAT) of the primary tumor and all metastases, either exclusively or in addition to standard systemic treatment, can lead to long-term disease control, achieving 5-year overall survival rates ranging from 12% to 52% (242-243). The definition of OM disease is highly debated in terms of the number of sites and lesions involved. In clinical trials, different cut-offs are often used for number of metastases and modes of staging. LESTRO and EORTC developed a general systematic classification in 2020 distinguishing OM disease (synchronous and metachron), from oligopersistent/oligoresidue disease (residual disease in a limited number of sites after an excellent response to systemic treatment) and oligoprogressive disease in the course of systemic therapies (244). The EORTC Lung Cancer Consensus Group aimed to overcome these limitations by expressing themselves on disease definition and staging of OM and most experts agree on the presence of a maximum of 3 or 5 lesions in up to 3 sites, excluding non-susceptible LAT organs (pleurae, peritoneum and leptomenon) and exoregional lymph nodal disease locations (245 states are defined with a PETF and 90 per cent for the OMG definition, and for PETF patients with stage >45). Regarding staging, PET-FDG and brain MRI have been established as mandatory tests for defining OM disease with a consensus of >90%. Numerous phase II studies (246-249) have demonstrated improved survival and reduced risk of local relapse through the use of radical-targeted local treatments, both on the primary and metastatic sites, in patients diagnosed with oligometastatic NSCLC. Resection of the primitive and oligomethastatic site may be considered in patients with good performance and adequate pulmonary function status. In addition to the imaging needed to rule out advanced metastric disease, an appropriate invasive mediastinal lymph node staging (EBUS/mediastinoscopy) is recommended, as the presence of lymph nodal metastases is associated with worsening prognosis. Traditionally, the surgical approach used in recent years is that of stereotactic prognosis (BRT), which is an increase of 55% in the incidence of OM disease. SBRT is a modern technique that, compared to conventional RT, allows higher doses of radiation to be delivered to smaller tumour targets with high conformation and dose gradient. It is a non-invasive treatment, which can be carried out in all major metastatic sites of NSCLC such as the lungs, brain, adrenal glands, liver and bone. To date, there are still no studies comparing surgery and SBRT in the disease, and most of the studies conducted in this setting have included patients who could undergo both surgery and RTSC alone. QUESTION GRADE 13 In patients with advanced oligostatic NSCLM, a locoregional treatment in combination with systemic radiotherapy is recommended in patients suffering from advanced radiation therapy. In patients with oligometastatic advanced stage NSCLC, locoregional treatment in combination with systemic therapy should be considered. Strength of recommendation: STRONG IN FAVOR Motivations/comments to benefit/harm balance: A literature search was performed on Medline and Embase databases, updated to July 2022. After removal of duplicates, 1212 articles were found; out of 7 acquired papers, 3 papers were excluded as inappropriate for the study design, while the remaining 4 were selected for analysis. In the Phase II study conducted by Gomez et al. (250), 49 patients with metastatic ≤3 metastases in response or with disease stability alone after at least 3 months of systemic treatment were randomised (1:1) to continue with systemsic treatment in addition to receiving primary or add-on regional therapy, and all patients were assessed at the endpoint of the study as having either primary or secondary endpoint disease progression (PFS), and all were evaluated on radiation toxicity. With a median follow-up of 38.8 months (28.3-61.4), PFS was 14.2 months (95% CI 7.4-23.1) with the addition of topical treatment vs 4.4 months (IC95% 2.2 - 8.3) obtained with systemic therapy alone; overall survival was also higher: 41.2 months (CI95% 18.9-NR) vs 17 (IC95 10.1-39.8; p=0.17), with no clinically relevant toxicity finding. Median survival was 17 months in the chemotherapy-only arm and was not reached in the radiotherapy arm. No site progressions were reported for SBRT and the rate of distance progressions was lower than for patients receiving medical therapy alone. In a pooled analysis (252) of 2 randomised Phase II studies (EMPRO-BRT and MCCDA), results were compared in 148 patients on pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) with or without additional radiation therapy. In the PEMBRO-RT study, the first dose of pembrolizumab was administered within 1 week of the last radiotherapy session (24 Gy in 3 fractions), whereas in the MDACC study, immunotherapy was initiated concurrently with day 1 of radiation treatment (50 Gy in 4 fractions or 45 Gy in 15 fractions). The PFS was 4.4 months with immunotherapy alone and 9 months with the addition of radiotherapy (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.45-0.99; p=0.045). The median survival in patients undergoing radiation therapy was 19.2 months compared to 8.7 months in patients receiving pembrolizumab alone (0.67; 95% CI 0.54-0.84; p=0.0004). Radiation therapy did not result in increased toxicity in these studies either. A meta-analysis of the 4 randomised controlled trials comparing the addition of locoregional therapies to systemic therapy in patients with oligometastatic advanced stage NSCLC was conducted, which demonstrated a significant increase in overall survival (overall HR 0.51; ICR 0.95% -0.36-72), progression free survivorship (Overall HR 0.32; ICR 0,95%-0.29-35) and overall response rate (OCR 2.24; ICR 1.95-398; OCR 1.595; ICR 1.56 -0.94); a significant decrease in the likelihood of disease progression at the interregional level (ICR 1.595-10.95); no significant difference in the overall rate of treatment (OGR 1.594-10.91); and a significant reduction in the incidence of cancer progression by 0.95%, if the overall treatment rate is between 0.59 and 0.59 (OGM). 1.59; 95% CI 0.96-2.61) and the systemic treatment discontinuation rate (overall RR 0.95; 95% CI 0,06-14.97). Although the overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be low, the results of this meta-analysis suggested that the benefits derived from the combination of a locoregional treatment with systemic therapy in patients with advanced oligometastatic NSCLC outweigh the harms, ultimately supporting the implementation of locoregonal treatments in combination with systemics in this subset of patients in clinical practice.",

The most frequent EGFR sensitising mutations are exon 19 deletions (Ex19dels) and the L858R point mutation in exon 21, which together account for approximately 85% of cases, defined as common or classic mutations. The remaining 15% of EGFR Mutations are represented by a heterogeneous group of molecular alterations (single or complex), defined as uncommon or rare (10-12%) with residual amino acid losses in exons 18, 19, 20 and 21, or by amino acid insertions with exon only residues (3-6%) of 20 exons (26-64). The need to identify all clinically relevant mutations in the EGFR gene, which are amenable to personalised treatment with specific inhibitors, requires the use of diagnostic procedures with an appropriate reference range; in other words, it is necessary to use technologies capable of detecting all the above EGFR mutations, specifying this in the report with the appropriate international nomenclatures (265). RECOMMENDATION: In patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with classic activating mutations of the EGFR gene (Ex19dels and L858R), first-line treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib should be considered as a first-choice therapeutic option over gefitinib and/ or erlotinib. The benefit in PFS was observed in all predefined subgroups, including patients with brain metastases (n=116; HR 0.47; IC95% 0.30-0.74). At the cut-off date for the PFS analysis, the OS data were not yet mature and the median had not been reached in the two treatment arms. 0.45-0.88; p=0.007), whereas the threshold for statistical significance of this interim analysis was set at 0.0015. The investigators subsequently reported some data related to exploratory endpoints (266), such as second PFS (e. g. time between randomization and progression to treatment line II), which was found to be higher in the osimertinib arm compared to the control arm (median: not reached vs 20 months, HR 0.58; 95% IC 0.44-0.78; p = 0.0004). The FLAURA study allowed the enrollment of patients with asymptomatic or clinically stable brain metastases.

The independent centralized review of brain imaging showed a higher brain PFS (primary endpoint of the pre-planned subgroup analysis) in the Osimertinib arm (median: not reached vs 13.9 months; HR 0.48; 95% IC 0.26-0.86; p=0.014). Patients treated with osimertnib also had a better brain RR (66% vs 43%; OR 2.5; 95% IC 1.2-5.2; p = 0.011). Osimertanib was found to be better tolerated than gefitinib and erlotinib, with a lower incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events (34% vs 45%). The final data from the OSLA study published at the start of 2020, FULA, showed a significantly increased survival at 31.8 months compared to patients receiving osimertinic (26.0% vs 43.0%; median: 0.04-64.6), and a significant increase in survival compared to control arm (268). 47% of patients included in the control arm (gefitinib, erlotinib) had received osimertinib at the time of progression (following detection of EGFR T790M mutation). Overall benefit/ harm balance: The balance of desirable and undesirable effects favours therapy with Osimertinib over first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

A literature search was performed on the databases and Medline Embase. After duplicate studies and the acquisition of full-text prospects, state 1 studies were included (see Appendix 2: Research strategy and selection of studies involving the presence of common and non-clinical EGFR mutagenic factors in the presence and efficacy of Osimertinib and PRMA studies). A post-hoc analysis combined data from the LUX-Lung 2 (single-arm phase II study), LUX -Lung 3 (randomised phase III study comparing afatinib and cisplatin/ pemetrexed) and LUX--Lung 6 (randomised phase III trial comparingafatinib with cisplatine/ platinum) studies to test the activity of afitinib in patients with specific uncommon EGFR mutations (268). Of the 600 (268) patients treated with afotinib in these 3 trials, only 12 (75%) had rare mutations in EGFR. In this analysis, mutations were not common in 3 groups: single point mutations or duplicate mutations of 18-21, duplicated mutations from 18-22, or by including them in combination with other mutations (group 20); group 1 (groups 20, 20 and 20); and group 2 (combination group T790). The clinical outcomes of a retrospective series of patients (n=315) who received afatinib as a tyrosine kinase I inhibitor for the treatment of non-small cell lung neoplasms with non-common EGFR mutations were reported by Yang et al. The authors observed a clinical benefit, in terms of ORR and TTF, decreasing from combined mutations (ORR 77.1%; median TTF 14.7 months) / point-like mutations major (G719X, L861Q, S768I, in combination with or without other mutations, with the exception of T790M or exon 20 insertions) (OR R 60%; mediane TTF 10.8 months)/ other uncommon mutations [OR R 65.2%; mediana TTF 4.5 months] / Exon 20 inserted (or R R 24.3%; TTF 4.2 months) (269). A randomised phase III study compared a linear therapy with afatinib vs. platinum-based chemotherapy in 109 patients with advanced stage NSCLC with uncommon EGFR mutations (G719X: 39.4%; L861Q: 18.3%; S768I: 2.8%), demonstrating a significant benefit in terms of PFS (HR 0.42; 95% IC 0.25-0.69) in favour of afitinib (271). Bar et al. reported the clinical outcomes of a retrospective series of patients (n=46) who received osimertinib as a first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of non-small cell lung neoplasms with uncommon EGFR mutations. Finally, the scientific literature offers a multitude of case series or individual case reports, documenting the activity of first-, second- and third-generation inhibitors against 'non-classical' EGFR mutations. In light of the multiplicity of reports, reference is made to the specific literature for each precise molecular alteration and the importance of discussing rare mutations in the context of dedicated molecular tumor boards is reiterated. Limitations: Risks of performance, detection and crossover bias, non-direct applicability of the results to the question of interest. Benefit/harm balance: Positive in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with uncommon EGFR mutations (mutations/duplications of exons 18-21); unfavourable in patients who have locally advancing or metostatic NSDLC with EGFR insertion of exon 20.",

CHRYSALIS is an open-label, non-randomised, dose escalation and dose expansion study that assessed the activity and tolerability profile of amivantamab in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR 20 insertions progressing to a platinum-based chemotherapy line (276).

      "text": "Regarding the treatment of line I patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions, ESMO 2023 presented the results of the PAPILLON study, the first randomised Phase III study to demonstrate a clinically and statistically significant benefit in terms of ORR (73% vs 47%) and PFS with the addition of amivantamab to platinum-based chemotherapy compared to platinium-based chemo alone (median 11.4 vs 6.7 months; HR 0.40; 95% IC 0.30-0.53; p < 0.001). QUESTION 17 GRADE: In patients with advanced stage NSCLC with classic EGFR mutations (Ex19dels, L858R) and identified T790M mutation (via solid or liquid biopsy) at the time of progression to gefitinib, erlotinib, dacomitinib or afatinib, is treatment with osimertinib recommended (compared to chemotherapy)? The AURA3 study, published by Mok et al. in 2017, is an open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase III study conducted in 419 patients with advanced T790M mutation-positive NSCLC progressing after a first or second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor line I therapy. Patients enrolled in the study were randomized (2:1) to receive either osimertinib (80 mg/day) continuously or chemotherapy with pemetrexed (500 mg/mq e. gv. 1) in combination with either cisplatin (75 mg/dmq v. 1) or carboprexed (AUC 1) every 3 to 6 weeks and maintained for up to 1 week. After a median follow-up of 8.3 months, the PFS assessed by the investigators (primary endpoint) was significantly better in the osimertinib arm compared to that of chemotherapy (median 10.1 vs 4.4 months; HR 0.30; 95% CI 0.23-0.41; p < 0.001) and this benefit was also confirmed by an independent blinded central review (279). This crossover effect is likely to be responsible for the lack of superiority of osimertinib over chemotherapy in terms of OS. The analysis of patients with brain metastases (n=116) (281) documented the superiority to osimertnib over chemo-therapy in brain RR (in patients with measurable brain disease: 70% vs 31% [OR 5.13; 95% CI 1.44-20.64; p=0.015], while in patients with or without measured brain metestasis: 40% vs 17% [OR 3.24; 95% IC 1.33-8,81; p=0,014]). Interstitial pneumonia and prolongation of the QTc interval occurred in 4% of patients treated with osimertinib, respectively. Overall benefit/ harm balance: The balance between desirable and undesirable effects favours Osimertinib which has been shown to significantly increase objective systemic and cerebral responses and progression-free survival and to delay encephalopathic disease progression compared to chemotherapy, with a low tolerability profile (event reversibility greater than or equal to grade 3) of adverse events. The crossover effect is likely to be responsible for the lack of superiority of osimertinib over chemotherapy in terms of overall survival. Quality of evidence The quality of evidence was judged to be VERY LOW for the following reasons: risk of bias (open-label design of the study, associated with a sensitivity analysis carried out through an independent blind centralized review with regard to progression-free survival; the study sponsor, responsible for data collection and analysis, was instrumental in the interpretation of the results), lack of generalizability of results and inaccuracy of estimates. The emergence of a second susceptible driver of molecular targeted therapy (e. g. BRAF p.V600E mutation, ALK, RET, FGFR fusions) may lead to combination treatment with osimertinib and a specific inhibitor, in clinical trials or off-label programmes. FGFR) may lead to combination treatment with osimertinib and a specific inhibitor, in clinical trials or off-label programmes. New treatment scenarios will hopefully open up due to two new drug classes in EGFR-mutated pulmonary neoplasms: bispecific antibodies (anti-EGFR/MET, amivantamab) and antibody drug conjugates (ADC anti-HER3, patritumab deruxtecan; ADC Anti-TROP2, datopotamab deructecan), currently undergoing clinical trial. Extending as much as possible the benefit obtainable with a molecular targeted treatment is a clear element of interest in the overall management of EGFR mutated disease and, in general, of targeted oligonuclear tumours. In the ASPIRATION study, published by Park et al. in 2016, 171 of 207 patients with an activating EGFR mutation had developed RECIST progression on line I treatment with erlotinib (285). Of these, 78 and 93 had changed therapy and continued erlotnib beyond progression, respectively. In this second group, against a first median RISTEC PFS (primary endpoint) of 11 months, an overall time of treatment with Erlotinib (secondary end point) of 14.1 months was documented. Always as at the secondary endpoints of these patients, the median estimated RESTEC progression in these patients was 33.5 months compared to 22.6 months in the second-line treatment. At a median follow-up of 32.4 months, the median OS (secondary endpoint) was not reached. At the subsequent progression requiring a systemic change of therapy, 26 patients with evidence of EGFR mutation T790M received EGFR in a prospective third-generation progonitor. In the absence of randomised data, the overall median time of therapy with erlotinib (primary end point) was 27.7 months, median PFS according to RECIST (Secondary Endpoint) 16.8 months, and median between the differences of the two values (5.1 months). In the retrospective case reports, up to approximately 60% of patients who progressed to osimertinib (administered almost exclusively after a previous inhibitor) continued beyond progression therapy and, among these, percentages ranging from 21% to 45% also received topical treatment in combination with TKI (287-289). The efficacy parameters studied were different between the various studies. Although using only retrospective data, the addition to the specific inhibitor of local therapies (radiotherapy, surgery, interventional radiology techniques) is suggested in the presence of oligoprogression. Both the scenarios of beyond progression therapy and local therapy in the case of oligoprogression should always be discussed in a multidisciplinary context, with the aim of delineating the best treatment for each patient. Once the molecular treatment options have been exhausted, patients with EGFR mutation tumors are candidates for chemotherapy according to the schemes used in non-squamous histology.",

      "text": "Among first-generation ALK inhibitors, the PROFILE 1014 study, published by Solomon et al. in 2014 (293) and updated in 2018 (294), is a randomized, open-label, multicentre, phase III trial of 343 patients with previously untreated ALK rearrangement-positive NSCLC. In this study, patients were randomised (1:1) to receive ALK crizotinib (250 mg/dl) inhibitors or chemotherapy with RFS-based chemopreventive chemotherapeutics for patients with advanced crizotin deficiency. Treatment with crizotinib was superior to chemotherapy in terms of PFS and RR. After a median follow-up of approximately 46 months, median OS was still not reached in the crizitinib arm and was 47.5 months in the chemotherapeutic arm. Although the difference in OS was not significant in the final analysis, it was found to be significant after correction for crossover, thus supporting the use of the ALK inhibitor as a first-line treatment. Overlapping results between PROFILE 1029 and 1014 were observed in terms of PFS and RR, with a significant benefit in favor of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (295). In addition to crizotinib, ceritinib was also compared with platinum-based chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC and ALK rearrangement. The study ASNDCE-4, published by Soria et al. in 2017, is an open-label, multicenter, randomised, phase III trial of 376 patients with stage IIIB/IV NCSC, and AL K rearrange (296). Patients were randomized to receive either 1:150 mg/day (7b) or higher pemetrexed platinum based chemotherapeutics, and one was shown to be superior to PFSR and RFS. Ceritinib was superior to chemotherapy in terms of RR and PFS. No significant difference in OS was reported (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.50-1.08; p=0.056), but it should be considered that, at the time of the analysis, the OS data was not yet mature and that 72% of patients progressing in the chemotherapeutic arm had subsequently received an ALK inhibitor. Among the adverse events of each grade, those reported with greater incidence in the ceritinib arm than in the chemical therapy arm were gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. At this dose level, ceritinib is approved and reimbursed in Italy as a first-line therapy in ALK-rearranged metastatic disease. QUESTION 18 GRADE. In patients with locally advanced or metastasized ALK NSCLC, is first line treatment with alectinib recommended (compared to cbotinib)? Alectinib, a second-generation ALK inhibitor, was compared with crizotinib in 3 randomised Phase III studies: J-ALEX, ALEX and ALESIA (298-300). The J-ALEx study, published by Hida et al. in 2017, is an open-label, multicentre, randomized Phase III study conducted in Japan in 207 patients with advanced NSCLC, with 0-2 ALK-arranged performance status, not pre-treated with chemotherapy (64%) or had received a prior randomisation (36:1) or a primary chemotherapeutic regimen (298%). Patients were randomized to receive either L-alactinib (150 mg) or PFS (300 mg) b.i.d. The primary endpoint was PFS as assessed by a panel of independent reviewers. The study was discontinued at the second pre-planned interim analysis for demonstrating a significant superiority of alectinib in terms of PFS (median not achieved with alecktinib vs 10.2 months with crizotinib; HR 0.34; 95% IC 0.17-0.71; p <0,0001). A pre-planed exploratory analysis showed that alectinib reduced the risk of progression compared to crisotinib, both at the extracranial and cerebral levels. The RR was also greater in the alectinib arm (92% vs 79%), while the OS data were not yet mature at the time of the AllASCO analysis. The final analysis of the 2021 study was reported (30 JEX-AL1). At a median follow-up of nearly 70 months, PFS remained distinctly in favor of alectinib versus crizotinib (median 34.1 vs 10.2 months; HR 0.37; 95% IC 0.26-0.52), while the OS remained overlapping (medians not reached; HR 1.03; 95% IC 0,67-1,58), considering that 79% of patients in the crizitinib arm had received alactinib at progression. The ALEX study, published by Peters et al. in 2017, is an open-label, multicenter, international, randomised, phase III study conducted in 303 patients with advanced ALK-angiogenic NSCLC, untreated, and with performance status of 0-2 (299). The PFS assessed by the investigators, which was the primary endpoint of the study, was significantly higher in the alectinib treatment arm, both in the first analysis and at the last available update (median 34.8 vs 10.9 months; HR 0.43; 95% IC 0.32-0.58) (302). At a median follow-up of 48.2 months, the LOS was also in favour of alectanib (medians not reached vs 57.4 months; stratified HR 0.67; 95% IC 0,46-0.98). The RR was also higher in alectnib treatment arm (85.4% vs 71.00; p=0.9). Alectinib was also significantly superior to crizotinib in terms of time to brain progression (HR 0.18; 95% CI 0.09-0.36 in patients with baseline brain metastasis; HR 0.14; 95% IC 0.06-0.33 in the absence of baseline cerebral metastases) (303). The ALESIA study, published by Zhou et al. in 2019, is an open-label randomised, multicentre phase III study in which 187 ALK-positive (performance status 0-21) Asian patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either alectinib as linear treatment I (600 mg b.i.d.) or crizitinib (250 mg B. i.d.). The RR was higher in the alectinib arm (91% vs 77%; p=0.0095) and treatment with Alectinib was also higher for brain disease outcomes: the intracranial response rate was 73% and 22% in the two respective arms (n=67 in total), while the risk of brain disease progression was significantly lower in the treatment with alectnib arm (HR 0.14; IC95% 0.06-0.30). The 5-year study update was presented at ESMO Asia 2022 (304). At a median follow-up of 61 months, the benefit in PFS was confirmed (median: 41.6 vs 11.1; HR 0.33; IC923-0.495%). In these 3 studies the incidence of grade 3-5 adverse events was lower with alectinib than with crizotinib. The approved and reimbursed dose of alectitinib in Italy is 600 mg b.i.d. In patients with locally advanced or metastatic stage NSCLC with ALK rearrangements, a linear treatment with brigatinib is recommended (compared to crizotinib)? RECOMMENDATIONS: In locally-advanced or metastable-stage NSCLL patients with ALQ rearrangeements, an optional linear therapy with brigotinib may be considered as the first choice of therapy over crizitinib. Brigatinib, a second-generation ALK inhibitor, was compared with crizotinib in the ALTA-1L study (305). The study, published by Camidge et al. in 2018, is an open-label, multicentre, global, randomised, phase III trial of 275 patients with advanced NSCLC, with 0-2 ALK-rearranged performance status, not pre-treated with chemotherapy (74%) or who had received a previous chemotherapeutic regimen (26%) (305). Patients were randomising to receive brigatinib (180:1) mg/day after an initial period of 90 days at 7 mg/d. daily or 7 mg /d. day induction. The primary endpoint was PFS as assessed by an independent review panel. The study was therefore positive for brigatinib at both the first analysis (303) and the update published by Camidge et al. in 2020 (306) (median 24 vs 11 months; HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.35-0.68; p <0,0001). The PFS assessed from the experimenters, evaluated outside of primary or secondary endpoints of the study, was also positive in favor of brigitinib (medium 29.4 vs 9.2 HR; 0.43; 95% CI 0,31-0.611; p < 10,0001). Regarding the secondary objectives of the trial, the RR assessed independently by the review panel was in favour of Brigatinib (74% vs 62%; 1.75% OR; 1.09% CI; 1.04-28; p=0342). At a follow-up of 25 months and approximately 61 patients who had received brigutinib at the time of treatment in the arm, no progress was made in either arm; the median IC was 0.77 to 0.97; no progression in both arms = 0.97%; the HR was 0.79 to 0.71). Brigatinib was shown to be superior to crizotinib on the cerebral RR of disease, both in patients with measurable disease (n=41, 78% vs 26%; OR 11.67; 95% CI 2.15-63.27; p=0.0014) and in all patients with brain metastases at baseline (n =98, 66% vs 16%; OR 12.75; 95% CI 4.19-32.91; p < 0,0001). Within the latter group, intracranial PFS was more prolonged in the brigatinib group (median HR 24 months vs 5.61; frequency of occurrence of IC 9.31; 0.5%-0.99; incidence of patients with grade L ≥ 3 in each arm was less than 0.3% (71% vs 61%); in the two arms, the incidence was less frequent than 0.99% (grade L ≥ 3-5). Camidge et al. recently reported the final results of the ALTA-1L study (307). At a median follow-up of 40.4 months, the benefit in PFS of brigatinib was documented to overlap with the previous analysis. No differences emerged in OS (mean not reached; HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.53-1.22) while post-hoc analysis suggested an overall survival benefit of brigitinib treatment for patients with cerebrospinal metastases that were negligible in the study (BRI 0.81% vs. 0.91%). Overall benefit/harm balance: The balance of desirable and undesirable effects favours brigatinib over crizotinib. Brigatinib has been shown to increase progression-free survival, and to delay encephalic progression over crisotinib, with a favourable tolerability profile. Quality of evidence The quality of evidence was judged to be VERY LOW for the following reasons: risk of distortion (performance and sponsor), risk of lack of generalizability bias, risk of inaccuracy. Overall quality of the evidence: LOW THINGS: no conflict declared Question 20. In patients with metastatic NSCLC, with ALK gene rearrangements, is treatment with lorlatinib-line I recommended (compared to crizitinib)? The activity and tolerability profile of lorlatinib, a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor of ALK, in the line I treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer with ALK rearrangement were compared with those for crizotinib in the randomised phase III CROWN study, published by Shaw et al. in 2020 (308). Progression-free survival as assessed by the investigators, overall survival, objective responses, intracranial response and tolerability. At a median follow-up of 18.3 months for patients treated with lorlatinib and 14.8 months for those receiving crizotinib, PFS was in favor of lorlatitinib (median not reached vs. 9.3 months; HR 0.28; 95% CI 0.19-0.41; p < 0.001), corresponding to a 72% reduction in the risk of progression in favour of patients receiving lorratinib. In the 30 patients with brain lesions measurable at baseline, all parameters related to intracranial activity were clearly in favour of lorlatinib. These results also translated into a significant improvement in the quality of life in patients treated with lorlatinib, also considering the good tolerability profile, although the incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse events was higher in patients receiving Lorlatinib (72% vs 56%), mainly represented by changes in lipid composition, weight gain correlated with increased appetite and hypertension. A final study update was recently published, which, after a median follow-up of 60 months, demonstrated a progression-free rate of 60% at 5 years with lorlatinib compared to 8% with crizotinib, with 83% of patients with baseline brain metastases and 92% of patients without baseline cerebral metastasis free from intracranial disease progression at 3 years, further confirming the significant intracranic activity of lorlatnib (310). In patients with metastatic NSCLC, with ALK gene rearrangements, moderately strong treatment with lorlatinib should be considered (compared to crizotinib) (308-310).",

      "text": "QUESTION 21 GRADE: In patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with ALK rearrangement progressing to alectinib or ceritinib therapy, is lorlatinib treatment recommended (compared to chemotherapy)? RECOMMENDATION: In advanced NSCLL patients with progressive ALK regrouping on alectnib or brigatinib, treatment with Lorlatinib may be considered as a first-choice therapeutic option. Strength of recommendation: CONDITIONED TO FAVOR Reasons/comments to benefit/harm balance: The NCT01970865 study, initially published in 2017 by Shaw et al., is a phase I/II study aimed at determining the dose of lorlattinib for the subsequent development of the disease, and the spectrum of activity and valency of Loraltinib in various scenarios. Recently, a dose of 100 mg was added to the ALK et al. (312 mg/day) in the Phase II study, which reported positive results. Recently, Felip et al. reported an update of the phase II study, in which the dose of lorlatinib was 100 mg/day (312). In the EXP3B-5 cohort, patients had received at least one second-generation ALK inhibitor, and had possibly been previously exposed to chemotherapy. Patients included in this cohort were 139; median ORR, PFS (median follow-up 30.6 months), and OS (medan follow up 35.4 months) were 39.6%, 6.6, and 20.7 months, respectively. The median duration of disease response was 9.6 months. Of the 139 patients, 95 (68.3%) had brain disease, measurable in 57 (41%) of the cases. In the latter group, the RORR of intracranial disease was 56.1% and 36.7%, respectively, while the estimated durations of intra-cranially malignant and intra-cancerous cancer response were 12.7 and 9.4 months respectively for all patients treated in the study, including ROS. Hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia of any grade (84.4% and 67.1% respectively) and grade 3-4 (approximately 18% in both cases) were the most frequently encountered toxicities, followed by edema and peripheral neuropathy, neurocognitive effects and weight gain. The quality of the evidence was judged to be VERY LOW for the following reasons: serious risk of distortion, inconsistency, indirectness and inaccuracy. Overall quality of evidence: VERY LLOW COI: S. Novello abstained from voting on the recommendation As seen for EGFR-mutated disease, maintenance and succession of molecular targeted therapies capable of maintaining disease control for as long as possible are key elements in ensuring the best survival outcomes even in ALK-positive patients. In this regard, the feasibility of the above-mentioned strategies of beyond progression therapy and oligoprogression treatments in the case of locally supported retrogressions is reiterated. In an analysis of 2 single-arm clinical trials evaluating the administration of crizotinib in patients with NSCLC with ALK rearrangement, 120 of 194 patients who progressed to crizitinib (62%) had maintained treatment beyond progression (313). In this group, the OSI at time of progression was greater than in patients switching to RECIST progression therapy (still in the second generation pre-inhibitors era) (median: 16.4 vs 3.9 months; HR 0.27; 95% CI 0.17-0.42; p < 0.0001), as well as the OI at onset of crisotinib (medium: 29.6 vs HR 10.8 months; IC 0.30-0.95%; p< 0.46; p 0.0001). In a series reported by Watanabe et al. on the outcomes of 11 patients receiving the crizotinib-alectinib sequence, 6 had maintained the first generation inhibitor beyond progression for a median duration of 9.4 months from RECIST progression, without affecting the activity and efficacy of subsequent alectinib treatment (314). On the other hand, with respect to brain progression on crizotinib, Zhao et al. reported higher post-progression RECIST survival in patients who had switched to second-generation inhibitors compared to those who had maintained crisotinib beyond progression (317). Even in the case of ALK-rearranged disease, in the absence of evidence from randomised outlooks, the various differential outcomes observed in patient groups may reflect a variable aggressiveness of individual diseases more than the impact of different treatment strategies. On the contrary, the strategies and local therapy of oligoprogressive disease beyond progress also apply in the post-prescription setting, as long as additional therapeutic target molecules are available, especially in case of optional brain progressions (318). For those patients who develop systemic progression and for whom a subsequent line of treatment is indicated, platinum-based chemotherapy remains the recommended option, with particular reference to combinations with pemetrexed, given the peculiar activity of this drug in ALK-rearranged disease.",

Crizotinib has been shown to be particularly active in patients with advanced stage NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangement.[1] In an expansion cohort of the Phase 1 study of crizitinib, PROFILE 1001, 50 patients with late-stage NSCLL with Ros1 reorganization (319-320) were enrolled.[2] In this study, published in 2014 by Shaw et al. and updated with follow-up to 62.6 months in 2019, most patients had previously received 1 or 2 lines of therapy (respectively 42% and 44% of cases) and had been predominantly exposed to a platinum derivative (80%). Patients included in this study were treated with crizotinib at the standard dose (250 mg b.i.d.) achieving an RR of 72% (including 6 complete responses and 32 partial responses), a median duration of response of 24.7 months, median PFS of 19.3 months and median overall survival of 51.4 months. Grade 3 adverse events were hypophosphataemia (15%), neutropenia (9%), increased transaminases (4%) and vomiting (4%). The first large retrospective data collection on patients diagnosed with ROS1-positive NSCLC, EUROS1, involved 32 patients confirming prevalence in young patients (median age 50.5 years), female (64.5%) and non-smokers (67.7%). The objective response rate was 80%, with a median PFS of 9.1 months; no expected toxicity was identified (321). Three additional prospective, single-arm, phase II multicentre studies evaluated crizotinib in patients with rearrangement of ROS1. The second study focused on Asian patients with advanced ROS1-positive NSCLC who were pre-treated with one or up to 3 lines of therapy. The rate of objective responses (the primary endpoint of the study) was 71.7%. The median PFS was 19.7 months, while the tolerability profile was consistent with known crizotinib data (323). The third and final study is the METROS study, aimed at evaluating the activity and safety of crizitinib in previously treated patients with metastatic MET 14 exon amplification or mutation or with ROS1 rearrangement. Program on crizotinib for alterations of MET, ALK or ROS1 in patients with solid tumors, a basket trial conducted in France. The objective response rate was 47.2% with a best response rate reaching 69.4% (325). There are no direct comparison studies between crizitinib and chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC and ROS1-rearrangement patients, although some evidence suggests a particular activity of chemotherapies with pemxed. The clinical data currently available are predominantly from patients pre-treated with chemotherapeutics, but the high activity and efficacy demonstrated by crizotinb, together with the favourable toxicity profile, constitute evidence supporting the use of crizatinib I in line with the subgroup of patients with ROS2-rearrangeant patients. The benefit/risk/benefit balance is in favour of the higher risk-tolerance compared to placebo and the improved response in terms of survival and benefit from chemotheraphy. The main limitations of the studies are the small sample size (imprecision of estimates) and the absence of a control arm for prospective studies (risk of bias and indirectness), which, considering the heterogeneity of the populations included, are also found to be not comparable between them. Four clinical trials (STARTRK-2, ALKA-372001, STAR TRK-1 and STAR TrK-NG) demonstrated efficacy data with a good tolerability profile in favour of treatment with entrectinib in patients with ROS1 rearrangement. Most of the patients had an ECOG performance status of 0-1 (90.1%), were non-smokers (62.7%), pre-treated (62.8%); 34.8% had brain metastases. The LORR of the evaluable patients was 68.1% (IC95% 59.3-74.3), with 8.7% complete responses; the median time to response was fairly short: 0.95 (range: 0.7-26.6 months). The median Time to Progression was 2.8 months (ranges: 0.4-21.1 months); the PFS median was 15.7 months (ICIC 11-21.5%), while the OS median has not been reached. For patients with brain metasts, the RORR was 62.5%, the intracranial ROR was 52.5% (IC IC 37-67.3 months). The median intracranial PFS was 8.3 months (range: 6.4 to 15.7 months). The majority of treatment-related adverse events were Grade 1-2, the most frequent being dysgeusia (n=90; 42.9%), nausea (n =72; 34.3%) and constipation (n=\"66; 31.4%\"). Grade 3 adverse effects were weight gain (N=17; 8.1%), elevated ALT (N = 7; 3.3%) and diarrhoea (N=\"6; 2.9%); 7 patients (3.3%) experienced Grade 4 adverse reactions (hyperuricemia; hypertriglyceridemia; limbic encephalitis; myocarditis; elevation of creatinine). The main limitations of the studies are the small sample size (imprecision of estimates) and the absence of a control arm for prospective studies (risk of bias and indirectness), which, considering the heterogeneity of the populations included, are also found to be not comparable between them. Among the 56 patients pre-treated with ROS1 inhibitors, the median RR and PFS were 38% and 9 months, respectively. In the naïve patient cohort (n=71), a RR of 79% and a median PFS of 35.7 months were observed. As anticipated from the preliminary data already presented, repotrectinib demonstrated strong intracranial activity coupled with a good tolerability profile (329). A total of 34 ROS1-positive patients treated with repotrektinib in the phase I/II study had previously received crizotinib. A total of 34 ROS1-positive patients treated with lorlatinib in the Phase I/II study had previously received crizotinib. In this group, there was a confirmed response rate of 62% in non-pre-treated patients and 35% in crisotinib-prepared patients, with a median PFS of 21 months in the non-prior treatment patients and 8.5 months in pre-treatment patients.",

Half of the point mutations in BraF are located at the amino acid codon V600 of exon 15 (particularly V600E), while the remaining half are located in additional codons of exons 11 and 15. The NCT01336634 study, which included patients with metastatic NSCLC with BRAF V600E mutation, is an open-label, non-randomised, phase II study involving 3 cohorts. In cohort A, patients received dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor) as monotherapy; in cohort B, patients were treated with dabraphenib and trametinib (MEK receptor) as next-line treatment following first-line therapy; in cohorte C, with dabarafenib and trimethinib as line I treatment. The latter cohort results were published in 2017. Disease responses were obtained in 23 patients (64%), with 2 (6%) complete responses and 21 (58%) partial responses. The study was therefore positive, as the ORR cut-off for defining positivity was set at 60%. At a median follow-up of 15.9 months, median PFS was 10.9 and 14.6 months respectively, as assessed by the experimenters or by an independent radiological review committee. Median LOS was estimated at 24.6 months. In 82% of patients (22%), the emergence of adverse events resulted in the permanent interruption of total treatment. at least one Grade 3-4 adverse event: fever, increase in alanine aminotransferase and hypertension in 4 cases (11%), vomiting in 3 (8%). At the recent update of the study published by Planchard et al., with a median follow-up of 16.3 months, median ORR, PFS and OS were estimated to be 63.9%, 10.8 and 17.3 months respectively (332), while the rate of patients alive at 5 years after initiation of therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib was found to be 22%. Progression-free survival and toxicity profile, considering that this line I does not preclude subsequent chemotherapy-immunotherapy treatment. Quality of evidence The quality of evidence was judged to be VERY LOW for the following reasons: risk of bias, imprecision due to very small sample size, and non-direct applicability of the results due to lack of comparison arm. Overall quality of the evidence: VERY LAW COI: no conflict reported Patients who, for various reasons, did not receive the combination of dabrafenib + trametinib as a line I treatment may receive such therapy in subsequent lines, based on evidence demonstrating the clinical benefit of combining dabrapenib and trimetinib even in patients previously treated with chemotherapies (331). The efficacy data of the combination in this study were recently updated. The combination of dabrafenib and trametinib is approved and reimbursed in Italy for the treatment of patients with advanced stage NSCLC with BRAF V600 mutation. Due to their different biology and susceptibility to molecular targeted therapy, non-V600 BraF mutations may benefit from treatment with MEK inhibitors, which underlines the importance of a case-by-case discussion in multidisciplinary teams, evaluating the possibility of enrollment in dedicated clinical trials.",

After removal of duplicates and acquisition of full-text 4 studies were included (see Appendix 2: Research strategy and PRISMA study selection flow). Four clinical studies (STARTRK-2, ALKA-372-001, STAR TRK-1 and STAR TrK-NG) demonstrated efficacy data with a good tolerability profile in favour of treatment with entrectinib in patients with NTRK rearrangement. In total 119 patients were enrolled, 54 in ALKA-372-001 and 65 in STARTRK-1; 60% were NSCLC. Most of the patients had an ECOG performance status of 0-1 (96%, n=114/119) and were pre-treated with 3 or more lines of therapy. In the 3 patients with NTRK 1/2/3 fusion, the ORR was 100%, with a duration of response of 2.6, 4.6 and 15.1 months. The most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue/asthenia (46%; n=55/119), dysgeusia (42%, n = 50/119); paresthesia (29%, n=\"34/119\"), nausea (28%, n =\"33/119)) and myalgia (23%, n>27/119). More recently, Doebele et al. expanded the analysis by adding the START-2 phase II data again, thus obtaining a statistical polymorphism of 54% (334 patients in the primary NTRTRK-2 study), thus reaching a sample size of 1034 patients. For larotrectinib, two pooled analyses confirmed efficacy and safety (332-333). The first pooled analysis published by Drilon et al. (335) was performed on 55 patients with solid tumours (17 histologies) with NTRK fusion. LORR was equal to 75% by independent review and 80% according to the local investigator, regardless of age, NRTK fusion characteristics and histopathology. At a median follow-up of 12.9 months, the ORR reached 79% (95% CI 72-85) with 16% complete responses (75% ORR in patients with lung cancer). The median PFS reached 28.3 months (95% CI 22.1-not reached) and the median OS of 44.4 months (IC95% 36.5-not reached). The tolerability of larotrectinib was shown to be good, the majority of adverse events were grade 1-2, and the rate of grade 3-4 was 46%: anaemia (10%), neutropenia (5%) and elevated transaminases (2%) were the most common. Limits: Low statistical potency, absence of arm strength, no direct applicability on the control of the outcomes of interest in patients. In patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with NTRK fusion, treatment with very low kinase tyrosine inhibitors of entrectinib or larotrectinib may be favorably considered as a first-line therapeutic option",

After removal of duplicates and acquisition of full-text, 3 studies were included, corresponding to 9 extensive publications (see Appendix 2: Research strategy and PRISMA study selection flow). Two single-arm clinical trials (LIBRETTO-001, I/II; Libretto-321, II) and a retrospective analysis of patients treated within an extended access programme (ENSIR) demonstrated good tolerability and efficacy data in patients initially treated with libretto-001 in the phase I and phase II studies (338 patients were initially enrolled in the Libritto-001 trial) reported positive outcomes in favor of treatment with selperidone. Phase I of the study had defined the dose of selpercatinib to be taken as 160 mg b.i.d. In total, 356 patients with lung cancer were treated with RET fusion, and efficacy data included 69 and 247 patients, respectively, who were untreated for advanced disease and had received platinum-based chemotherapy prior to inclusion in the study. Among the latter, 58% had also received immunotherapy with anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 agents, and most patients had a disease pre-exposure status of ECOG 0-247, which was equal to 33% of patients in this group (940/242%, n= 61%). At a median follow-up of 26.4 months, the OSI was not yet estimated, with a proportion of patients alive at 2 years estimated at 69%. In accordance with the treatment of oncogeneaddicted disease, 35% of patients had maintained selpercatinib beyond progression with the sponsor agreement of the study. An ad hoc exploratory analysis compared the best objective response obtained from the previous selperkatinib treatment with that obtained with selpertatinib itself, both according to the evaluation of the experimenter.

Overall, 106 patients had brain metastasis at enrollment; at a median follow-up of 22.1 months, intracranial disease progression-free survival was 19.4 months. Among 26 patients with measurable brain disease, the independently reviewed intracranial RORR was 85%, including 27% complete responses, while the remaining 15% consisted of disease stability. Only 0.7% of 178 patients with no metastatic brain disease at the time of enrolment had confirmed brain disease progressions compared to those who had developed metastasized brain disease and were enrolled in the 2 years of the Libretto-001 treatment program that included prevented and prevented treatment with selperidone.",

Pembrolizumab increased the objective responses (46.1% vs 31.1%) and the duration of response (29.1 vs 6.3 months) (370). Overall, the tolerability profile was more favourable for pembrolizukab compared to chemotherapy, both in terms of the incidence of adverse events of any grade (76.6% vs 90%) and Grade 3-5 (31.2% vs 53.3%). While Grade 3-5 adverse events were observed in 13.6% and 0.7% of patients treated with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, respectively (359). benefit/ harm balance: in favour of pembrolizeumab due to the prolongation of progression-free survival and overall survival compared to chemo in the face of an improved tolerability profile in terms of treatment-related adverse effects of any degree and severity, except for immunorelated adverse reactions which were more frequent in the pembrolizaumab arm.

A literature search was performed on the Medline and Embase databases. The study demonstrated a statistically significant advantage in favor of atezolizumab over chemotherapy in 205 patients with high PD-L1 defined as PD-l1 expression in more than 50% of cancer cells or more than 10% of immune infiltrate cells assessed through the SP142 assay.In particular, median overall survival was 20.2 months with atezolizeumab vs. 13.2 months on chemotherapeutic (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.40-0.89).The difference in overall survivorship was not statistics-significant for those with high/intermediate L1 PD and has not been formally tested for any patients with any high PDL1 expression. A pre-planned exploratory analysis of the Impower 110 demonstrated that atezolizumab is superior to chemotherapy even in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 50% on tumour cells where expression was assessed with the 22C3 (20,2 vs 11 months; HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.42-0.86) antibody or with the SP3 (1269,5 vs 16.1; 0.71; HR 0.9 - 150%) antibody.

A literature search was performed on the Medline and Embase databases. After removal of duplicates and acquisition of full-text, 1 study was included. (tested with 22C3 antibody) and absence of EGFR activating mutations, ALK rearrangements or ROS1 (362). Non-smoking (< 100 cigarettes in a lifetime) was an exclusion criterion to the study, while patients with stage IIIB and IIIC who were not eligible for radical chemoradiotherapy treatment could be included. Histology and geographical origin of patients were stratification factors of the study. The two primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival, response rate and quality of life were among the secondary objectives of the trial. In patients with PD-L1 ≥ 50%, cemiplimab showed a significant increase in overall survival (mean survival not reached vs. 14.2 months; HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.42-0.77), progression-free survival 8.2 vs. 5.7 months; HD 0.54; IC95% 0.43-0.78) and response rate, which is also associated with an improvement in patients' quality of life. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 12% of cemiplimab-treated patients and 37% of those treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. 3% of patients treated with cemiplimab died from these events, which was a confirmed case of hyperprogression during treatment, amongst 64 patients who continued to receive a placebo-controlled combination therapy. In these patients, the rate of response, progression-free survival and overall survival at the time of addition of chemotherapy were 31%, 6.6 months and 15.1 months, respectively (363). However, this subgroup analysis is not adequately controlled for any confounding factors, so this strategy is not currently recommended in clinical practice. Limits: Performance bias, indirectness.

The KEYNOTE-021 study, originally published by Langer et al. in 2016, is a randomised, open-label, multi-cohort, phase II randomized trial that enrolled 123 patients with metastatic NSCLC with non-squamous histology, no EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement, and any PD-L1 expression level, with 0-1 performance status in line I. Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive pemetrexed (200 mg/mqb every 3 weeks) alone in combination with carboplatin (UCA 5v and 1 g/m3 every 3 months) and pembroxed (3500 mg/g/m6 every 4 weeks) for up to 24 months, and maintained chemotherapy (pemetrexed) or chemotherapeutic follow-up from 3 to 4 weeks. The updated analysis with a follow-up of 49.4 months confirmed the benefit in favour of the pembrolizumab combination arm in terms of both primary endpoint ORR (58% vs. 33%) and PFS (24.5 vs. 9.9 months; HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.35-0.83) and OS (34.5 versus 21.1 months); HR 0.71; IC95% 0.45-1.12), despite a 70% crossover from the chemotherapy arm to the combination arm. The KEYNOTE-189 study, published by Gandhi et al. in 2018, is a Phase III, double-blind, randomized trial in 616 patients with metastatic NSCLC with non-squamous histology, no EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement, and any PD-L1 expression level, with performance status of 0-1, in line I (366). Patients were randomised (2:1) to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg/mq ev every 3 weeks) or placebo, up to a maximum of 35 cycles, in combination with pemetrexed (500 mg/ mq e. v. g. every 1 week) and cisplatin (75 mg /mq v. p. e. every 3 months) or carboplatin (AUC) for 5 weeks. The primary endpoints of the study were PFS and OS.In an updated analysis of the trial with a median follow-up of 64.2 months, a significant benefit in favour of the pembrolizumab combination arm was confirmed for both endpoint (PFS: HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.42-0.60; OS: HR 0,60; 95% IC 0.50-0.72).The OS benefit is consistent across all subgroups analysed based on PD-L1 expression levels, including PD-l1-negative patients (n=190; HR 0.55; 95% CI 0,39-0,76) and those with PD- L1 expression 1-49% (n = 186; HR 0.65; IC 0.46-0.90).The survival rate at 5 years was 19.4% in the combination arm vs. 11.3% in the standard chemotherapy arm. For tolerability, there was no significant increase in the frequency of adverse events in the pembrolizumab arm compared to chemotherapy alone (Grades 3-5 52.1% vs 42.1%), and the incidence of immuno-related adverse reactions (any grade 27.7%, Grades 3-5 12.6%) was similar to that observed in the studies of pembrolizeumab monotherapy, with the exception of nephritis, which occurred more frequently than expected (6.2%). Discontinuation of at least one of the treatment components was more frequent in the pembrolizumab arm (33.6%) than in the placebo arm (16.3%), but in this respect it should be considered that the median duration of treatment in the Pembrolizumab arm was longer than that of placebo (9.8 vs 6.2 months) (367-Benefit/ Harm Ratio: In favour of the combination, considering the prolongation of progression-free survival and overall survival compared to chemotherapy in the face of a similar tolerability profile in terms of treatment-related adverse events of any degree and severity, with the exception of immunocompromised adverse reactions which were more common in the combination arm. In patients with advanced squamous histology NSCLC with PD-L1 expression < 50% and good performance status (0-1), a carboplatin, paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel-based line I treatment, and pembrolizumab, followed by maintenance therapy with pembrolizaumab in case of response or disease stability after 4 cycles of treatment, is recommended (compared to chemotherapy)? The KEYNOTE-407 study evaluated the addition of pembrolizumab to the first-line chemotherapy regimen in patients with advanced, squamous histology NSCLC with any level of PD-L1 expression. e study is a double-blind phase III study, which randomised patients (1:1) to receive pembrolizeumab (200 mg/ mq ev every 3 weeks) or placebo in combination with pacxel (200 mg / mq e. v. every 3 week) or nabclitaxel (100 mg/mq ev. every 1 week) and carbamazepine (carbamazepine) for 1 week and up to 3 weeks of treatment, followed by a placebo (35 g/ mQ ev. The study design allowed crossover after unblinding. Patients with ECOG PS 0-1, diagnosed with untreated squamous-type NSCLC, without symptomatic brain metastases, were eligible. Updated study results with a follow-up of 56.9 months show a significant increase in SOS in the pembrolizumab-treated group (17.2 vs 11.6 months; HR 0.71; IC 59.9 - 0.855%), with a survival rate of 18.4% vs 9.5% in the standard chemotherapy arm of 5 patients. PFS was also superior in the pembrolizumab arm (8 vs 5.1 months; HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.52-0.74), with an objective response rate of 62.2% for the combination with pembrolizaumab compared to 38.8% in the placebo arm. In terms of tolerability, the combination had overlapping adverse events compared to the placebo-treated group: 74.5% G3-5 Adverse Events for the Pembrolizumab group vs. 70% of the placebo group (369-370). The quality of the trials was judged to be LOW for the following reasons: involvement of the sponsor in protocol design, data analysis and manuscript writing; selection of the enrolled population (risk of bias) and lack of generalizability of results. Overall quality of trials: LOW IOC: no reported conflict Q used 35 .In patients with advanced stage NSCLC without active EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements, with PD-L1 expression < 50% and with good status (0-Mate 1), a treatment of linear ipibumab in combination with nivolumab and 2 chemotherapy cycles based on placebo was included in the recommended clinical trial. Following the completion of the study, a review of the literature and performance of the clinical trials has been carried out. After a duplicate check of the EMLA III data, a full bibliographical and performance evaluation has been performed. The CheckMate 9LA study, conducted by Paz-Ares et al. in 2021, is a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase III study to compare the efficacy and toxicity profile of the combination of nivolumab (360 mg every 3 weeks), ipilimumab (1 mg/ kg every 6 weeks) and 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, with only standard platinum based chemotherapeutic (maximum 4 cycles followed by pemetrexed progression in non-squamous histology) as treatment for ISC patients with advanced linear NLC, EG/ FRKAL: wt-selected, PD-treated, and LH1. The secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR). Overall, 791 patients were randomised (1:1) to receive the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy (n=361) or platinum-based chemotherapies alone (n = 358). The study population was predominantly female (86.5%) with non-squamous histology (69%) and PD-L1 expression >1% (60.5%) (371). The study achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating superiority in OS for the combination chemotherapeutic and immunoassay therapy compared to chemotherapie alone. With an updated median follow-up of 30.7 months, the median LOS was 15.8 in the experimental arm compared to 11 months in the HR control arm (N=361), or 0.85% in the platinum based chemotheraphy alone (N =358). The median efficacy was also demonstrated in the encephalic arm (375) with PIC 0.71-0.85% and 6.76% in the PIC control arm, respectively, and 0.87% in the 5-month HR-based control arm (0.7682). The combination also demonstrated efficacy in the subgroup of patients with brain injury (371-372). Results presented in 2023, with a 4-year update and a follow-up of 47.9 months, confirmed the overall survival (OS) advantage, with 21% of patients treated with nivolumab + ipilimumab and 2 cycles of chemotherapy alive at 4 years, compared to 16% of those treated with chemotherapeutic alone. This benefit was also maintained in the secondary endpoints during the extended follow up, regardless of the histology and tumour expression of PD-L1 (373). Regarding toxicities, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (247% in the experimental arm vs. 329% in the control arm), anemia (21%) vs. 50 (14%) [arteries (24% vs. 3%) ], increased lipase (31% vs. 81%), and [arsenic lipase] (32% vs. 8%). (14 [4%] vs 2 [1%]), lipase increases (22 [6%] vs 3 [1%]) and asthenia (3 [ 1%] vs 8 [2%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 106 (30%) patients in the experimental arm and 62 (18%) in the control arm, with a similar percentage of toxic deaths in both arms (2%) (371). Limits: Performance bias. Benefit/ harm ratio: In favour of the combination due to prolongation of progression-free survival and overall survival compared to chemotherapy, against a similar tolerability profile, with the exception of immunocorrelated adverse effects, which were more frequent in the combination trial arm. In patients with advanced squamous and nonsquamous histology NSCLC, without EGFR-activating mutations or ALK rearrangements, with PD-L1 expression < 50% and with good performance status (0-1), treatment with Moderate Strong in favour of line I with ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab and 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy followed by maintenance therapy with nivalumab plus ipilamumab should be considered as a first-line option (371)",

A literature search was performed on the Medline and Embase databases. After removal of duplicates and acquisition of full-text, the Phase III EMPOWER-Lung 3 study was included in the analysis. EMPOWER-Lung 3 is a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase III study to compare the efficacy and toxicity profile of the combination of cemiplimab (350 mg every 3 weeks) and platinum-based chemotherapy at the choice of the investigator versus standard platinum based chemotherapies alone (maximum 4 cycles followed by pemetrexed maintenance in non-squamous histology) as the first-line treatment for patients with advanced stage NSCLC, EGFR/ALK/ROST1: W, not selected for histopathology and PD-L1. The study population was predominantly male (84%), smokers (53%) with non-squamous histology (57%) and PD-L1 expression >1% (70%) (374). The study achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating superiority in terms of OS for the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy compared to chemotherapeutic OS alone: median 21.9 months in the experimental arm compared to the control arm, with a combined HR of 0.71 (HRIC of 0.53-0.93%). The study also determined a significant increase in the median rate of immune therapy and response in the objective arm (53% vs. 22.5%; HRIC of 0.56-0.95% vs. 0.77%; and median response rate in the PIC-PIC arm, which was 22.2% and 0.75% respectively). However, the subgroup analysis showed that there was no statistically significant benefit in OS for patients with PD-L1 < 1% (HR: 0.74; IC95%). With regard to toxicities, the most common adverse events of grade 3-4 in the chemotherapy arm were anaemia (10.8% in the experimental arm vs. 6.5% in the control arm) and neutropenia (6.4% vs. 5.9% of patients) in both OS and PFS, with 42.7% of patients treated with cemiplimab + chemotherapeutic agents at 2 years of life compared to 27.3% of those treated with chemotherapies alone. Limits: Performance bias Benefit/ harm ratio: favourable to the combination due to the prolongation of progression-free survival and overall survival compared to chemotherapy, with a similar tolerability profile, except for immunocorrelated adverse events, which were more frequent in the combination arm.

      "text": "In patients not selected for molecular characteristics or PD-L1 expression level, chemotherapy (in most cases with cisplatin-based regimens) has been shown to be effective in prolonging LOS compared to best supportive care (BSC) (372). In patients candidates for chemotherapies, the standard treatment is a double dose containing a platinum derivative associated with a third-generation agent (vinorelbine, gemcitabine or taxane), for 4-6 cycles. The addition of a third drug to the double dose resulted in an increase in RR without significant differences in survival and with a worse toxicity profile (373). However, none of the randomized trials comparing the different platinum-derived and third-generation regimens established with certainty the superiority of any one regimen over the others, so that all third generation regimes can be considered substantially equivalent in terms of efficacy, with different toxicity profiles (376-381). With regard to the most effective platinum derivative, the meta-analysis published by Ardizzoni et al. in 2007 demonstrated that the use of cisplatin determines a non-significant increase in OS in the general population and a significant benefit limited to the subgroup of patients with non-squamous histology and in combination with third generation drugs, and therefore the preferred regimen should be considered as a valid alternative in the presence of carboplatin, whereas the carbamate represents a viable alternative against cisplatine (382). The JMDB study, published by Scagliotti et al. in 2008, is a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase III trial of 1725 patients with stage III or IV NSCLCB (not amenable to treatment for curative purposes) (384). Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive cisplatin/ gemcitabine (cisplatin 75 mg/ sq. v. g. 1 and gemcitabin 1250 mg/ sq. v., g. 1, 8 every 3 weeks) or cisplatine/ pemetrexed (cisplatin 75 mg / sq. w. g.1 and pemeterexed 500 mg/ sf. v.1 every 3 week) for up to 6 cycles or until disease progression or untreatable toxicity. In the general population, treatment with cisplatin/ pemetrexed was shown to be no less effective than cis platin/ gemcitabine in terms of OS (median 10.3 vs 10.3 months; HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.84-1.05, with the upper limit of the confidence interval below 1176 constituting the established limit for non-inferiority) and PFS (medan 4.8 vs 5.1 months; HD 1.04; 95% IC 0.94-1.15), with a similar RR in both arms (30.6% vs 28.2%). There was a lower incidence of grade 3-4 haematological toxicity (neutropenia: 15% vs. 27%; anaemia: 6% vs. 10%; thrombocytopenia: 4% vs. 13%; p < 0.001) and alopecia (any grade vs. 12%; p = 0.002) compared to the cisplatin/ gemcitabine arm, while there was a higher incidence for grade 3-4 nausea (7% vs. 4%; p=0.004). QUESTION 37 GRADE: In patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous histologic NSCLC, with absolute contraindications or related to linear I immunotherapy, in response to or disease stability after 4 cycles of chemotherapy with platinum derivative and pemetrexed, is maintenance therapy with pemeterexed recommended (compared to observation alone)? The study consisted of 2 phases: a non-randomised phase (induction phase) in which 939 patients not previously treated for advanced disease received line I therapy with cisplatin/ pemetrexed (cisplatin 75 mg/ sq. ft. g. 1 and Pemetrexed 500 mg/ sq. ft.1 every 3 weeks) for 4 cycles, and a subsequent randomized phase (maintenance phase), in which eligible patients who were not in disease progression after induction (n=539) were randomised (2:1) to receive pemeterexed (500 mg/ Sq.ft. every 1 week) + placebo or BFS + BFS. The primary endpoint of the study was maintenance evaluated by the investigators. The median PFS was found to be significantly better for the pemetrexed arm compared to placebo (4.1 vs 2.8 months; HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.49-0.79; p < 0.0001) and this benefit was also confirmed by an independent radiological review committee (3.9 vs 2.6 months; HD 0.64; 95% CI 0.51-0.81; p=0.0002). On the basis of these data, pemetrexed is approved and reimbursed as maintenance therapy for stable or responsive non-squamous disease following combination platinum-based chemotherapy, and is an option that can be discussed with the patient. The role of the addition of the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab to chemotherapy for line I of advanced NSCLC was investigated in phase III studies exclusively in non-squamous histology, as an excess of pulmonary haemorrhage toxicity was observed in patients with squamous-histology NSSC in a phase II study (387). The primary endpoint was OS. In this study, patients were randomised (1:1) to receive carboplatin/ paclitaxel (carboplatin AUC 6 e. v. g. 1 and Paclitaxel 200 mg/ mq e.v. g.1 every 3 weeks) for up to 6 cycles, with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/mq 1 e. w. every 3 week; the latter could be continued as monotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. An increased incidence of adverse events was also reported with the addition of bevacizumab (hypertension, proteinuria, haemorrhage, neutropenia, febrile neutropenie, platelet insufficiency, hyponatremia, rash and headache); notably, there were 15 treatment-related deaths in the bevazizumab arm (compared to 2 deaths for the control arm), of which 5 were attributed to pulmonary haemorragy and 5 to complications of febrile neutropenia. Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to receive cisplatin/ gemcitabine (cisplatin 80 mg/ mq e. v. g. 1 and gemsitabine 1250 mg/mq i. v., 1.8 g. every 3 weeks) for up to 6 cycles, combined with bevacizumab at low dose (7.5 mg / mq) or bevazizumab in high dose (15 mg/ dmq), or placebo at 1 g. each 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint of the study was initially OS, later becoming PFS at a later amendment. However, the benefit in PFS did not translate into a benefit in OS (median: 13.4 months for high-dose bevacizumab, 13.6 months for higher dose bevazizumab and 13.1 months for placebo) (390). The toxicity profile of bevavizumab was consistent with expectations, and the incidence of grade ≥ 3 adverse events was similar in the three arms alone; in this study, ≥ 3 grade pulmonary haemorrhages occurred in 2 patients in the placebo arm, 5 in the bevaxizumab arm, and 3 in the methotrexate arm.",

      "text": "In line II treatment of advanced NSCLC, docetaxel was shown to be superior in terms of OS to BSC or other chemotherapeutic agents such as ifosfamide or vinorelbine (393-394). Although pemetrexed was shown not to be inferior to Docetaxel in a randomised phase III study, the frequent use of pemeterexed in line I or maintenance therapy of nonsquamous histology NSCTC limits its role in the second line (395). However, two randomised trials comparing erlotinib and docetaxel in line II in wild-type patients for EGFR, the Italian TAILOR study and the Japanese DELTA study, as well as a meta-analysis based on literature data, demonstrated the superiority of Docetaxel compared to erlotnib in terms of PFS (HR 0.72; CI 0.50-1.06), but also OSHR (0.78; CI 0.54-1,12) (397-399). RECOMMENDATION: In patients with advanced stage NSCLC progressing to a chemotherapy line I, immunotherapy with nivolumab, atezolizumab or pembrolizumbab (the latter only in the case of PD-L1 ≥ 1%) should be considered as the first option over chemotherapeutic line II. The role of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) was assessed in CheckMate 017 (squamous histology, regardless of PD-L1) and CheckMate 057 (non-squameous histology independent of DP-L1), the role of pembrolizumab [anti-DP-1] was evaluated in KEYNOTE-010 (histological type-independent, PD-l1 positive), and the role for atezolizuma b [anti -PD-L1] was evaluate in the OAK study and POPLAR study in both histological type and PD- L1-40 (4007). The primary endpoints of the study were RR and OS but, prior to the pre-planned interim analysis, the protocol was amended to consider OS as the only primary endpoint. nivolumab-treated patients had an OS advantage (median: 9.2 vs 6 months; HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.44-0.71; p < 0.001 months), PFS 0.8% (medium: 3.5 vs 2.82; HR 0.62; IC 0.94; p < 0.58; RR 0.001) and p < 5%, compared to docetaxel (5% vs 0.008), and a 2% incidence of serious adverse reactions (57% vs 0.85%), with a range of 3 to 4 degrees of severity from 5% to 5% (contraindications) and a 3% incidence from 2% to 5% compared to each dose of docetaxil (55% vs 0.5%). The most frequently observed selected adverse events (as far as potentially immune aetiology) of any grade related to treatment were: hypothyroidism (4% with nivolumab vs 0% with docetaxel), diarrhoea (8% vs 20%), pneumonia (5% vs 0%), increased creatinine (3% vs 2%) and rash (4% vs 6%). In this study, PD-L1 (immunohistochemical agent with antibody 28-8) expression was retrospectively evaluated, which was found to be neither prognostic nor predictive in terms of efficacy for all endpoints considered, at any of the pre-specified cut-off values (1% vs 5% vs 2%). The CheckMate 057 study, published by Borghaei et al. in 2015, is an open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase III trial conducted in 582 patients with performance status of 0-1, with stage IIIB, IV non-squamous histologic NSCLC or relapsed after radiotherapy or surgery, with disease progression during or after at least one prior line of double platinum-based chemotherapy; previous maintenance therapy with pemetrexed, bevacizumab or erlotinib, and previous therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in case of EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangements were also permitted. At the time of the pre-planned interim analysis (after a minimum follow-up of 13.2 months), nivolumab was superior to docetaxel in terms of OS (median 12.2 vs 9.4 months; HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.59-0.89; p=0.002); this advantage was maintained even at a more mature follow- up (medan OS at a minimum following- up of 17.2 months; 12.2 versus 9.4 month; HR 0,72; 95% IC 0.60-0.88; p < 0.001), and was consistent across all pre-specified subgroups except for patients treated in line III, those with brain metastases and those with EGFR mutation. The most frequently observed treatment-related selected adverse events of any grade were: rash (9% for nivolumab vs 3% for docetaxel), pruritus (8% vs 1%), erythema (1% vs 4%), diarrhoea (8% versus 23%), hypothyroidism (7% versus 0%), increased ALT (3% vs 1%) and AST (3%, versus 1%), infusion reactions (3%, vs. 1%), and pneumonia (3, versus < 1%). PD-L1 expression (immunohistochemical agent with antibody 28-8) was also evaluated retrospectively in this study and, unlike in the CheckMate 017 study for patients with squamous histology tumours, the interaction test in CheckMate 057 suggested a strong association between PD- L1 expression and efficacy endpoints, observed with all pre-specified expression cut-offs (≥ 1%, ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%). The results of a post-hoc analysis also suggest that the greatest benefit of nivolumab is for patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 50% (HR 0.32), but these data should be interpreted with caution as this was an unspecified study conducted in a small number of patients (n=112). A potential risk of bias for this study is the open-label conduct and sponsor involvement in data collection and analysis. The good tolerability profile of nivolumab has been confirmed (402). KEYNOTE-010, published by Herbst et al. in 2016, is a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase II/ III trial in 1034 patients with performance status of 0-1, advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% (assessed centrally by 22C3 immunohistochemistry), and disease progression after at least one line of treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy (including an appropriate tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy for patients with EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement) (403). Approximately 30% of the patients included in the study had received 2 or more prior lines of treatment. The co-primary endpoints of the study were OS and PFS, both in the general population and in the group with tumour expression of PD-L1 ≥ 50%; median OS was significantly higher for pembrolizumab compared to docetaxel, in both the general populations (10.4 months with pembrolizaumab at 2 mg/ kg versus 8.5 months with docettaxel; HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.58-0.88; p=0.008; 12.7 months with 10 mg/kg pembrolizeumab versus 8.1 months with Docetaxel;HR 0.61; 95% IC 0.49-0.75; p< 0.0001) and in a population of patients with PD- L1 ≥50% (14.9 months with Pembrolizimab 2mg/ kg vs. 8.2 months withdocetaxel); HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.38-0.77; p=17.30,000; pembrozizumab 10 months vs. docetaxil 2 mg / kg; HR 8.50-0.95%; while no significant differences were observed between the two groups of patients treated with pembrocimab; HR < 0.90,000; no significant difference was observed in the two arms). A post-hoc exploratory subgroup analysis showed a significant benefit in patients with non-squamous histology, whereas the benefit was not significant in scaly histology probably due to sample size.The recent update to 42.6 months of follow-up confirmed the benefit in median OS. Patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50% had a median OS of 16.9 months (IC95% 12.3-21.4) with pembrolizumab versus 8.2 months (95% CI 6.4-9.8) with docetaxel (HR 0.53; IC95% 0.42-0.66; p < 0.00001); patients with TPS≥ 1% also had a significant benefit (HR 0.69; IC95%) 0.60-0.80; < p0.00001) The median PFS was significantly greater for pembrolizaumab compared to docetaxil in the population of patients with PDL ≥ 50% (5 months for pemblolizuma b 2 mg/ kg vs 4.1 months for docetaxal; HR 0.59; IC 95% 0.44-0.78; p=20,000; pre-implantation of pembrolizeumab 10 mg/kg vs. 4.9 mg/ month; docetaxilab 2 months; HR 0.78; HR 0.95; Grade 3 - 5 adverse events were more frequent in the docetaxel arm (35%) than in the two pembrolizumab arms (2 mg/ kg: 13%; 10 mg/kg: 16%), and the toxicity profile was consistent with that expected: the most frequent immunocompromised events with pembrolizab were hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and pre-monotony, with more than 1 to 2 outcomes possible. Potential risks of study bias are represented by: open-label design (with no masking even by the external data monitoring committee), involvement of the sponsor in the analysis and interpretation of the data and in the drafting of the article, and lack of significance in PFS in the general population, which was one of the primary endpoints of the study (although it is likely that PFS may not represent an adequate efficacy endpoint in line II immunotherapy studies). The POPLAR study, published by Fehrenbacher et al. in 2016, is an open-label, randomised, multicentre, phase II study in 287 patients with NSCLC, stage IIIB or IV, previously treated with 1 or 2 chemotherapy lines and with performance status of 0-1 (405). Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive atezolizumab (1200 mg e. v.) or docetaxel (75 mg/ mq), every 3 weeks. The primary endpoints of the study were OS (intention-to-treat, ITT) in the entire population and in the PD-L1 expression subgroups (calculated as the percentage of tumour cells and infiltrating immune cells expressing PD- L1: tumour TC3 ≥ 50%, TC2 ≥ 5% and < 50%, TC1 ≥ 1% and < 5%, and TC < 0.1%; infiltrated immune cells: IC3 ≥ 10%, IC2 ≥ 25% and < 10%, CI ≥ 1%, and < 0.5%, and IC0 < 0.1%) analysed centrally using the Ventana SP14 antibody. The benefit in OS increases in the PD-L1 expression subgroups as the expression level increases: in the TC2/3 or IC2/3 (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.33-0.89; p=0.014) and TC1/2/ 3 or IC1/2/3 subgroup (HR 0.59), the benefit was significant for atezolizumab compared to docetaxel; in patients with TC0 and IC0 status, there was no difference in benefit. There was no significant difference in benefit between the two arms in terms of PFS, except for the subgroup of patients with high PD-L1 expression (TC3 or IC3), where there was a benefit for atezolizumab (HR for PFS 0.60; 95% IC 0.31). There was also no difference in RR in ITT between the arms (15% for atezlizuma b vs 15% for docetaxel), but in the subset of patients who had high LC1 expressions (PC3 or CI3) the RR was higher for atezelizuma B compared to docetazel (38% vs 13%). Atezolizum was better tolerated than docetazole, with a lower incidence of events occurring more frequently than those occurring at 3-4% (40% vs 3%) in the transdermal treatment arm, and the most frequently reported increases in pulmonary arterial disease were 53% (2%) and 3% (2%). The OAK study, published by Rittmeyer et al. in 2017, is an open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase III study conducted in 1225 patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, previously treated with 1 or 2 lines of chemotherapy (including one or more platinum-based therapies, and tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy for patients with EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement) and with performance status 0-16. Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive atezolizumab (1200 mg intravenously) or docetaxel (75 mg/mq) every 3 weeks. The co-primary endpoints of the study were OS in the whole population (intention-to-treat, ITT) and in the PD-L1 positive population (≥1% of tumour cells, TC1/ 2/3 or ≥1% of immune infiltrate cells, IC1/ 2/3). The median OS was significantly higher for atezolizumab than for docetaxel, in the ITT population (13.8 vs 9.6 months; HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.62-0.87; p=0.0003), in the PD-L1 positive population (n=463; 15.7 vs 10.3 months;HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.58-0.93; p=0.0102), and in patients with no expression of PD- L1 on tumour cells and inflammatory infiltrate cells (TC0 and IC 0.379; 12.6 vs 8.9 months; IC 0.75; IC 0.59%-0.596; p = 0.0215). In patients with high expression of DP- L 1 cells (≥50% of tumour cell, or 10% of T cells, or ≥3 months) the benefit is also significantly greater than in the IRC < 0.131; HR 0.45; p=20.95; HR 0.97; The benefit of OS in favour of atezolizumab was consistent across all predefined subgroups including patients with squamous disease (n=222; HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.98) and non-squamous (n = 628; HR 0.73 and 95% IC 0.60 to 0.89), non-smoking patients (N=156; HR 0.71 and 95% CI 0,47 to 1.08) and patients with brain metastases (n=\"85\"; HR 0.54; 95% CI 0,031 to 0,94), except for patients with EGFR mutation (HR 1,2495; IC 0,75% to 1,181). In terms of RR, there were no significant differences between the two arms in ITT (18% for atezolizumab vs. 16% for docetaxel), but in the subgroup of patients with high expression of PD-L1 (TC3 or IC3) the RR was higher for Atezolizumab compared to docettaxel (31% vs. 8%). Potential risks of study bias are represented by: open design and involvement of the sponsor in the analysis and interpretation of the data and in the drafting of the article. Based on these data, nivolumab (at a flat dose of 240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks) is approved in Italy for the treatment of advanced NSCLC after prior chemotherapy, regardless of PD-L1 expression; pembrolizumab (2 mg/ kg intravascularly every 3 weeks) has been approved to treat advanced NSSLC with PD-l1 expression ≥1% after at least one prior chemical therapy (either EGFR or ALK positive patients must also have received targeted molecule therapy before receiving pembrolizab); atezolazumab (1200 mg and 3 weeks flat dose) has also been approved for the management of advanced nSCLC, irrespective of previous chemotherapeutic exposure; or patients who have received a targeted molecular therapy prior to receiving PD- L1 expression (both EGFR and ALK positives must also receive targeted ALK therapy). Risk/ benefit balance: The risk/ benefit ratio in all studies favours treatment with inhibitory checkpoint compared to standard chemotherapy in terms of adverse events of both any grade and severe grade G3-4.",

      "text": "The quality of the evidence was judged to be MODERATE for the following reasons: the main limitation of the studies is their open-label design; they are also not comparable with each other for different populations selected by histology or by level of PD-L1 expression; there are also no direct comparison studies of either superiority or non-inferiority; overall quality of evidence: MODERATED COI: no conflict stated For rationale, summary of evidence and details of the recommendation see Appendix 1. The LUME-Lung 1 study, published by Reck et al. in 2014, is a randomised (1:1) double-blind, multicentre, phase III trial in 655 patients with locally advanced, relapsed or metastatic NSCLC, with 0 to 1 performance status, previously treated with a chemotherapy regimen. In this study, patients were randomised to receive docetaxel (75 mg/mq e. v.) once every 3 weeks + nintedanib (200 mg b. i. d.) or placebo every 2 to 21 weeks, until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. In the ITT population, after a median follow-up of 7.1 months, PFS was 3.4 months in the docetaxel + nintedanib arm vs. 2.7 months in Docetaxel+ placebo arm (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.68-0.92; p=0.0019); the PFS benefit was observed independently of histology (HR in adenocarcinoma histology: 0.77; HR in squamous histology:. OS was statistically significantly longer in the nintedanib arm compared to the placebo arm for patients with adenocarcinoma that had progressed within 9 months of initiation of line I therapy (10.9 vs 7.9 months; HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.60-0.92; p=0.0073) and for all patients with adenocarcinoma (12.6 vs 10.3 months; 0.83 HR; 95% IC 0.70-0.99), but not in the total population including all histologies (10.1 vs 9.1 months; HD 0.94; IC 0.95%; 0.83-1.05). In terms of safety profile, the most common adverse events among patients treated with nintedanib compared to those treated with placebo were: diarrhoea (all grades: 42.3% vs 21.8%; grade ≥ 3: 6.6% vs 2.2%), increased transaminases (ALT, all grades:26.8% vs 8.4%; grade≥ 3: 7.8% vs 0.9%; AST, All Grades: 22.5% vs 6.6%; grade: ≥ 3.4% vs 0.5%), nausea (all degrees: 24.2% vs; grade3: ≥ 0.8% vs. 0.9%) and decreased appetite (all grades: 22.2% vs. 15.6% and ≥ 1.3% vs. 1.4%). The combination of docetaxel and nintedanib was further investigated in the open-label, Phase IIb study, SENECA (410). This was a comparative study to evaluate non-inferiority in efficacy between the three-week schedule of Docetaxel 75 mg/ m2 e. g. v. 1 in combination with nintedinib (200 mg b.i.d.) and Docetaxil 33 mg/m2 e . After a median follow-up of 35.5 months, the median PFS between the two arms was 4.79 months for the three-week schedule vs. 4.82 months for weekly schedule (HR 0.97; 95% IC 0.68-1.38; p=0.8439) and the OS is 8.49 months vs. 9.62 months for, respectively, the three weekly and weekly schedules (HR 0,88; 95% CI 0.48-1.61; p=0.0003131). No difference in efficacy was identified in the two cohorts of the study: patients progressing within 3 months of the end of line I chemotherapy and patients progressive after 3 months from the end Of line I chemo. At the time the LUME-Lung 1 study was designed, docetaxel was the standard line II treatment, whereas currently a possible treatment option approved and reimbursed in Italy in this setting is immunotherapy with nivolumab and atezolizumab (regardless of PD-L1 expression) or pembrolizumab (for cancers with PD-l1 ≥ 1%), these 3 drugs having demonstrated, in randomised phase III studies, superiority to docetaxil in terms of OS and with a favourable toxicity profile compared to docettaxel. Limitations: A potential risk of bias for this study is the fact that the hierarchical OSH analysis was introduced prospectively when the study was already started and after the primary analysis for PFS had already been performed, but before the closure of the OSH database; in addition, sponsor staff were involved in protocol design, as well as in data analysis and interpretation. A limitation in terms of transferability may be that the age of the study population (median age 60 years, range 53-67) is lower than that usually observed in clinical practice in this pathology line. In patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma histology, the addition of nintedanib to docetaxel may be considered, especially for Very Low Condition patients with progressive disease within 9 months of initiation of line I therapy (408-409).",

      "text": "In randomised trials in elderly patients, mono-chemotherapy with a third generation agent (vinorelbine) demonstrated a significant prolongation of overall survival compared to supportive therapy, whereas the combination of third generation agents (gemcitabine/ vinorelphine) did not demonstrate an advantage over gemcitabine or vinorELBINE in mono chemotherapy (411-412). Regarding the use of double platinum derivative vials, the IFCT-0501 study, a French randomized phase III trial, enrolled 451 elderly (aged 70-89 years) patients with advanced NSCLC and performance status of 0-2 (413). A 2015 Cochrane meta-analysis evaluated 51 trials in the elderly population and compared mono-chemotherapeutic treatment with platinum versus non-platinum (7 trials) and polychemotherapy treatment with Platinum to non-Platinum (4414 trials). In this study, a significant increase in OS was observed in favor of the doubled dose (median: 10.3 vs 6.2 months; HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.52 - 0.78; p < 0.0001), at the cost of increased toxicity, especially in terms of febrile neutropenia (any degree: 9.4% vs 4%) and toxic deaths (4.4% vs 1.3%). In this meta-analysis, no significant difference was observed in terms of OS for mono-chemotherapy with platinum to non-platinum (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.72- 1.17), whereas a possible positive impact on OS was seen for poly chemotherapy treatment with Platinum to Non-Platinum ( HR 0.76; 95%CI 0.69-0.85), with an increase in toxicity (primarily anaemia, piastrinopenia, fatigue and peripheral neuropathy). A joint analysis of the randomised Phase III MILES-3 and MILES-4 trials, published by Gridelli et al. in 2018, evaluated the addition of cisplatin to line I mono-chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC, aged ≥ 70 years and with performance status of 0-1 (415). 299 patients with any histology were enrolled in MILES-3 and were randomised (1:1) to receive cisplatin/ gemcitabine (cisplatin 60 mg/ sq. ft. every 1.8 days and gemcitabin 1200 mg/ sq. ft., 1.8 days every 3 weeks) or Gemcitabine alone (1200 mg/ squ. ft, 1.8 days each 3 weeks); 232 patients with non-squamous histology included in the MILES-4 study and were randomized (1:1:1) to either cisplatine/ gemcina or gemcitabina or cisplatino/ pemetrexed (cysplatin60 mg/ scm. v. g. every 1 week and pemetrexed 500 mg/ stm. The analysis of the two studies compared cisplatin (n=263) and mono-chemotherapy (n = 268) double doses with a benefit for the combination with Cisplatin in terms of RR (15.5% vs 8.5%; p=0.02) and PFS (median 4.6 vs 3 months; HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.63-0.92; p = 0.005) but not of OS (9.6 vs 7.5 months, HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.70-1.04; p= 0.14) nor of quality of life, in the face of a significant increase in the incidence of haematological toxicity (astropenia, leucopenia) and non-haematologic toxicities (haematological mucositis, nausea, death/neurological fatigue), since the first study, patients with an abnormal survival rate after chemotherapy were excluded from these studies. This was a Phase II study conducted in 103 patients with advanced NSCLC with performance status 2, who were randomised (1:1) to receive treatment with carboplatin/paclitaxel (carboplatin AUC 6 g. 1 and paclitaxel 200 mg/mqg. 1 every 3 weeks) or cisplatin/gemcitabine (cisplatin 60 mg/ mqg.1 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/Mqg.1.8 every 3 week), obtaining overlapping results in terms of efficacy in the two studies (RR 25% vs; TTP2 vs 4.8 months; OS2 vs 6.9 months) and with similar toxicity to that observed for chemotherapy in the population with a performance status of 0-1.0 if performed chemotherapeutically. A meta-analysis of 6 randomised trials, comparing efficacy and tolerability of platinum-based doubles vs. monotherapy in the treatment of line I patients with performance status 2, demonstrated that platinum based regimens are superior in terms of ORR and survival in the face of an increase in toxicity, predominantly haematological (417). Available data suggest that populations of elderly and/ or performance status 2 patients are likely to be highly heterogeneous, and patients in a candidate subgroup containing a single platinum derivative should be carefully considered for the reduced risk of excessive toxicity as well as the selective nature of the treatment. In elderly patients, the available evidence is mainly extrapolated from subgroup analyses of randomised trials obtained mainly with immunotherapy alone. Given these limitations, and pending the results of dedicated prospective trials, efficacy and tolerability in older patients would appear to be comparable to those reported for the entire population included in clinical trials (418-420). A comprehensive geriatric evaluation using specific scales including performance status, comorbidity and drug therapy is required before undertaking any therapeutic strategy.",

      "text": "A multi-modal approach including surgery, can only be considered in very select patients with limited stage disease (T1-T2, N0), who represent approximately 5% of patients with newly diagnosed SCLC (421-422). In all other cases, if the clinical condition of the patient allows, definitive radiotherapy chemotherapy should be considered as the first-choice therapeutic option. In the group of patients treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy (1111 out of a total of 2103), there was a 14% reduction in risk of death compared to those who were treated with chemo alone (p=0.001) and an increase in the 3-year survival rate of 5.4%, particularly in patients younger than 55 years of age, where a greater benefit was observed (p = 0.01). However, it is important to note how the trials differ in the dose and timing of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the anti-plastic therapy regimen used, the choice of the subset of patients treated with radiation therapy (all patients in some trials, those who had complete or partial responses, or patients with stable disease in others) and whether pan-encephalic prophylactic radiation was administered. The overall odds ratio (OR) for the benefit of radiotherapy on 2-year survival is 1.53 (95% CI 1.30-1.76; p < 0.001). The addition of radiation treatment to chemotherapy improves 2-year survivability by 5.4% (95% IC 1.1-9.7). Methane therefore showed a significant but limited improvement in survival. The most relevant result is reported in the improvement of 25.3% in local disease control with the combined treatment (IC95% 16.5-34.1), however correlated to the effectiveness of Radiotherapy in reducing rates of thoracic relapse. In a randomized clinical trial, in which 417 patients with limited-stage SCLC were enrolled, accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy produced a statistically significant improvement in 5-year survival (26% vs 16%; p=0.04) (425). In both groups, the total dose of thoracic radiation therapy was 45 Gy: 1.8 Gy/day in 25 fractions (5 weeks) in patients with standard fractionation, 1.5 Gy in 30 fractions BID (3 weeks) under accelerated hyperfractionation. accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy significantly improved 5-year survival compared to standard fractionation (26% vs 16%) and reduced the risk of local progression (36% vs 52%; p=0.06). The most significant acute toxicity was esophageitis G3, significantly more frequent in patients treated with hyperfractions (27% vs 11%; p < 0.001). In addition, 11 treatment-related deaths were reported (6 in the standard hypersensitivity group, 5 in that group). The study, designed in the late 1980s, presents an important limit to the applicability of the reported results in the control of hyperfracture at 5 years as compared to the standard radiation treatment (26% versus 16%), and reduces the risk for localized progression of the disease (36% v. 52%, p = 0.06). However, significant overall 2- and 5-year survival rates of 44% and 23%, respectively, were obtained in the study, confirming the efficacy of concomitant treatment in this setting. The multicentre Phase III CONVERT study recently compared accelerated hyperfractionation regimens with a total dose of 45 Gy (1.5 Gy in 30 BID fractions) with a conventional fractionation scheme, but with higher total doses (66 Gy), 2 Gy in 33 fractions, in both cases in combination with chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide, administered for 4-6 cycles (426). A statistically significant difference in survival, which is the primary endpoint of the study, was not achieved between the hyperfractionated and conventional radiotherapy arms (30 vs 25 months, respectively; HR 1.18; 95% CI 0.95-1.45; p=0.14), while toxicity was similar between the two arms, except for a higher incidence of grade 4 neutropenia in the hyper fractionated arm (49% vs 38%; p = 0.05). Grade 3 and 4 oesophagitis were similar in the two groups. the validity of the hyperfractionated radiotherapy approach in this setting, in line with the data reported in the study by Turrisi et al. (425). However, in centres where a regimen with hyper fractionated chemoradiotherapy is not feasible or at the patient's choice, conventional high-dose total radiation chemotherapy treatment may be considered as a valid therapeutic alternative. Regarding the integration of the two treatment modalities, several studies have evaluated the timing of radiation therapy with respect to chemotherapies (early or late administration). The meta-analysis of De Ruysscher et al., (427) is of reference for this setting. The effect of the timing of the start of thoracic radiotherapy on survival is unclear. No significant differences in survival at 2 or 5 years were observed in the overall analysis of the study. A post-hoc analysis excluded the study in which a platinum-free chemotherapy schedule was used, and a trend for 2-year survival was seen in favour of starting radiation therapy within 30 days of the beginning of chemotherapies. In the abstract, there are insufficient data to assess the risk of selection bias and the toxicity of the various treatments used. Benefit/ harm balance: In the light of the evidence described, concomitant chemoradiotherapy is the option of choice in patients with SCLC with limited disease, however, an adequate selection of candidate patients who may benefit from this approach through the assessment of clinical conditions is critical. For each patient, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was calculated. No significant differences from the CCI were reported in response rates (p=0.20), overall survival (p = 0.09), frequency of G3-G5 toxicity (p=\"0.49\"), number of treatment-related deaths (P=0.36) and completion of therapies, thus suggesting that the various comorbidities are not an absolute limit to concomitant chemoradiotherapy, but should be assessed and related to the clinical picture of the individual patient.",

The incidence of encephalic metastases in pulmonary microcythoma is extremely high. It is estimated that 10% of patients present at diagnosis and that 50-70% may subsequently develop these. In view of this risk, prophylactic cerebral radiotherapy (PCI) is used as an integral part of therapeutic strategies. The use of PCI to determine a significant reduction in the risk of developing brain metastasis is a topic of renewed interest and is currently under review. The use of PCI results in a significant reduction in the risk of developing brain metastases and is currently a topic of renewed interest. A recent meta-analysis published in January 2019 analyzed 7 studies conducted on patients with limited/extended-stage SCLC, randomized to receive PCI or clinical observation only, for a total of 2114 patients. Primary objectives of the study were overall survival and incidence of brain (BM) metastasis. The results show both a significant decrease in the incidences of BM (HR 0.45; IC95% 0.38-0.55; p <0.001) and a significant prolongation of overall survivorship (HR 0,81; IC95%, 0.67-0.99; p < 0.001) for patients undergoing PCI. The survival analysis is characterized, however, by a high degree of heterogeneity among the limited/extensive stage SCLC patients (PCI=4.002 or PCI=0.001), which increases the level of survival in the study population, which includes the uncertainty about the extent of the survival of patients in the real study. The results of the subgroup analysis for patients with limited stage disease confirm a significant increase in survival in favour of the PCI arm (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.71-0.94;) with a test of heterogeneity that is not statistically significant (I2=0%; p=0.65). Furthermore, the sub group analysis based on the presence or absence of brain imaging at the end of radiochemotherapy treatment shows that there is no benefit in terms of OS for those patients who underwent CT or MRI after chemo-radio-encephalography (HR 0,94; IC 0,95%; IC 1,84-174; p=590) while a significant improvement in OS in favor of PCI was confirmed in patients who did not undergo any radiological examination of the brain (IC 0,97-0,295%; HR 0,705). PCI was confirmed in those patients who had not undergone any brain radiological examination (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.57-0.85) (429). A randomised prospective study comparing 25 Gy to 36 Gy showed that the optimal dosage of PCI consists of a total of 25 Gy administered in 10 fractions, with no evidence of therapeutic benefit from radiotherapy dose intensification (430). Subsequently, the evaluation data of neurological toxicity and quality of life in the medium and long term of the same study were reported (431). The results at 3 years did not show significant differences between the two groups of patients treated with different doses of IPC in any of the 17 subjects investigated for quality of living and cognitive and neurological functions.",

However, the two trials use different tools to assess neurocognitive abilities and the imaging protocol with MRI and follow-up visits are not overlapping (3 and 12 months for early and late assessment respectively in the Dutch trial and 4 and 24 months in the Spanish trial). Differences in dose distributions and even overly ambitious targets may be aspects to be highlighted to justify the results and are expected to better define the role of dose quality saving in the currently ongoing study. Limitations: Risks of bias and inconsistency between the estimates of the included studies. Benefit/harm balance: In favour of prophylactic brain irradiation. Overall quality Clinical trial recommendation Recommendation In patients with limited-stage SCLC and responding after moderate chemoradiotherapy, a strongly favourable (PCI) prophylaxis of the brain should be considered as the first option (430, 432-434)",

      "text": "In patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer, is a carboplatin, ethoposide and atezolizumab-based linear I treatment followed by atezolyumab maintenance therapy recommended in case of response or disease stability after 4 cycles of treatment compared to a platinum-based chemotherapy? Patients were randomised to receive induction chemotherapy for 4 cycles with platinum-posetophosphate in combination with atezolizumab or placebo (1:1) and, in case of response or disease stability, to be followed by maintenance therapy with atezumab and placebo. The two primary endpoints were PFS and OS. The two primary endpoints were OS and PFS. Addition of atezolizumab to platinum-based chemotherapy resulted in a significant increase in OS (12.3 vs 10.3 months; HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.54-0.91; p=0.007) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, and in PFS (5.2 vs 4.3 months; HD 0.77; 95% CI 0.62-0.96; p = 0.02) (435). Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) improved in both groups after initiation of treatment, but a more significant and long-lasting HRQOL was reported in patients treated with atezolizumab (436). Based on this evidence, the combination of carboplatin-etoposide and atezoizumab was first approved by EMA (September 2019) and subsequently by AIFA (with determination of September 2020) as a first-line treatment in extended-stage small cell lung cancer. This benefit was observed in most subgroups and was independent of PD-L1 expression and bTMB levels (437). In an analysis presented at WCLC 2020, data were reported on the survival benefit in the maintenance phase among patients receiving atezolizumab and chemotherapy, with median survival of 15.7 vs 11.3 months (HR 0.59; 95% IC 0.43-0.81) and median PFS, respectively, of 5.5 vs 4.5 months ( HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.50-0.8). RECOMMENDATION: In patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer, first-line treatment with platinum, etoposide and durvalumab, followed by maintenance therapy with durvalomab, in case of response or disease stability after 4 cycles of treatment, is recommended over platinum based chemotherapy? This was a prospective, multicentre, randomised, phase III study with 3 treatment arms and compared the ethoposide-cisplatin/ carboplatin antiblast combination with the combination of standard chemotherapy with durvalumab or the dur valumab-tremelimumab combination. The recently published study update, with a median follow-up of more than 2 years, confirmed a survival benefit in favour of the chemotherapy-durvalumab arm (12.9 vs 10.5 months), maintaining a 25% reduction in risk of death compared to chemotherapeutic alone (HR 0.75; 95% IC 0.62-0.91; p=0.0032) and a safety profile consistent with the reported adverse events for the individual drugs. The combination of durvalumab with chemotherapy continues to demonstrate a reduction in the risk of death compared to chemotherapies alone (HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.60-0.86; p=0.0003). The updated median overall survival was 12.9 vs 10.5 months for chemotherapeutics alone; at 24 months, 22.9% of patients treated with dur valumab and chemotherapists vs 13.9% of the patients in the control arm were alive and at 36 months 17.6% vs 5.8% of patients, respectively. Overall, the efficacy, safety and quality of life data demonstrate a favourable risk-benefit profile for the combination of durvalumab with platinum-etoposide chemotherapy in this setting. Quality of evidence The quality of evidence was judged to be LOW for the following reasons: risk of bias and inaccuracy. Of these, 6 were excluded for the following reasons: 4 published as abstracts, 2 with non-overlapping inclusion and exclusion criteria. 8 studies were included. Different therapeutic regimens were found to be active in the treatment of I-line extensive small cell lung cancers, being characterized by high chemosensitivity. However, the various studies reported partially conflicting results on the most active regiments in this setting. Patients treated with cisplatin-containing regimens benefited from a significant reduction in the risk of death at 6 months and 1 year, reporting an OR of 0.87 (IC95% 0.75-0.98; p=0.03) and 0.80 (IC95 0.69-0. 93; p = 0.002), respectively, a higher likelihood of survival and response rates. A meta-analysis based on 4 comparative studies of cisplatin-containing chemotherapy or carboplatin (663 patients) suggests that these therapeutic combinations are equally active in terms of response rates, progression-free survival and overall survival, with differential outcomes from the more severe myelotoxicity profiles in the non-cisplatin containing regimens (442). A potential limitation of this meta-analysis is the use of different therapeutic regimens in the included studies. A more recent evaluation of the effectiveness of platinum-based polychemotherapy (either cisplatin or carboplatin) compared to non-platinum regimes was carried out in the 2015 Cochrane meta-Analysis (443), which analysed survival, response, toxicity and quality of life data reported in 32 studies for a total of 6075 patients. Only 4 trials reported the assessment of quality of life, but as different methodologies were used in the various studies this endpoint was not included in the analysis. In the sub-analysis conducted in SCLC patients with extensive disease, unlike the other sub-groups, a statistically significant 6-month survival advantage was reported in favour of platinum-based polychemotherapy (RR 1.09; IC 1.02-1,175%). Combinations were evaluated in randomised phase III trials, showing limited efficacy compared to patients with platinum + ethoxanthine-induced disease, and more promising results were obtained from the combination of SCLC and varcanide. The most promising results were obtained with the combination of irinotecan + platinum-derived drugs. Several meta-analyses have been conducted and controversial results have been reported on the effective efficacy of this combination compared to the standard platinum ethoposide approach. Data from one of the most recent meta-analyse conducted on the topic (444), which included 7 randomised trials (2027 patients), shows a better overall survival in patients treated with irinotecane-platinum, compared to those treated with ethopo-platin. The RR and PFS are similar for the two regimens. However, there is a significant heterogeneity between the studies, probably attributable to pharmacogenomic differences, related to the polymorphism frequency in different populations and ethnicities, affecting the function of genes involved in the transport and metabolism of the regimen, and to the various peculiarities reported in the use of the drug, in fact, the combination has been predominantly reported. In particular, the first evidence comes from a small Japanese study (445), which reported a significant increase in median survival (12.8 vs 9.4 months) and 2-year survival in favour of the cisplatin-irinotecan combination, which was not subsequently confirmed in two large studies conducted in the United States (446-447). A broader evaluation of the efficacy and toxicity between different platinum-based regimens compared to the cisplatin-etoposide combination was performed in the meta-analysis of Jiang et al. (448), including 12 randomised trials with 7 different regimes (irinotecan-cisplatin, carboplatin-itoposide, carboplatin - gemcitabine, etoposide-platincis-epirubicin-cyclofoside, etoposide-cysplatinpaclitaxel, topote-canclisin, platinplatin etoposid-ifamide). In addition, there is significant heterogeneity between the studies, probably attributable to pharmacogenomic differences, related to the frequency of polymorphisms in different populations and ethnicities, affecting the function of genes involved in the transport and metabolism of irinotecan and the various regimens used, which exhibit peculiar pharmacokinetics. In a Phase III study, the activity of the carboplatin-pemetrexed combination was also evaluated in this setting compared to the placebo-positive schedule, following the encouraging results of the Phase II study. has been shown to be less effective in terms of overall survival, progression-free survival and objective response rate (449).",

      "text": "QUESTION 45 GRADE: In SCLC patients with extensive disease and in response to chemotherapy, is prophylactic brain irradiation (PCI) recommended? RECOMMENDATION: In patients with extended disease and SCLC who have responded to chem therapy, prophylactic brain ir radiation (CPI) may be considered as a first-line treatment option. Strength of recommendation: CONDITIONED IN FAVOR Motivations/comments on the benefit/harm balance: Prophylaxis of brain radiation therapy in patients with pulmonary microcythoma with expansive disease is one of the most debated topics at present. In this setting, the historical reference data are those from the 2007 EORTC study (450) in which brain radiotherapy in patients in the metastatic group with only an increased response to PCI demonstrated a significant reduction in survival compared to patients with no symptomatic response but also a significant benefit of 27.1% (7.1% vs. 0.2%) in the symptomatic control group with PCI. In fact, while in the EORTC study baseline brain imaging was not required except in symptomatic patients, in the Japanese study brain MRI was routinely performed at baseline, after chemotherapy, and during follow-up. Furthermore, overall survival for all patients is longer than the overall observations in the Japan study. One of the major differences between the two studies, and probably the most significant one, lies in the treatment of these patients (451). The limited availability of brain MRI and possible doubts about the translation of Japanese results with much higher survival rates than those typically achievable in Europe may explain why surveillance with MRI should be considered with caution at this time (452). Several meta-analyses have been conducted and published to clarify the controversial role of PCI in widespread disease. The 2018 Ge et al. (453) metanalysis analyzed 14 studies including 1221 patients in the PCI group and 5074 in the control group. The results show an advantage in terms of overall survival (ICHR 0.57; ICHR 0.47-0.69; p < 0.001) and the time of appearance of brain metastases (ICR 0.47; ICR 0.67-0.97; IHR 93,03%), based on the available data showing that the survival rate is 46.07% at 9 months, followed by a life expectancy of 93.33%. Available quality of life data show that the detection rate is 93.7% at baseline, then decreased to 46.3% at 9 months. From baseline to month 9 there is no statistically or clinically significant difference in overall health status between the 2 study groups (p=0.10). Fatigue and lethargy appear significantly higher instead in patients undergoing PCI with a RR of 4.92 (2.86-8.44). The CREST study randomised patients to response after systemic treatment between observation and moderate-dose thoracic radiotherapy and demonstrated an increase in both 2-year survival and progression-free survival at 6 months, although the primary endpoint was 1- year survival, which is not significantly improved Question 46. In patients with SCLC progressing to a chemotherapy line I, is topotecan treatment recommended compared to observation-only and other therapies? 84 of the records obtained by the search strategy and after removal of duplicates, 9 were recovered in the full-text line. The study published by von Pawel et al. (457), conducted in 211 patients with progressive SCLC after an initial response to line I chemotherapy, compared treatment with topotecane (i. e., administered at a dose of 1.5 mg/ mq/ day for 5 days, every 3 weeks) with the combination of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and vincristine (AVC). The differences observed in terms of median time to progression (13.3 vs 12.3 weeks, respectively; p=0.552) and overall survival (25 vs 24.7 weeks, respective; p = 0.795), were also not statistically significant. Regarding treatment-related toxicity, grade 4 neutropenia was significantly more frequent with the CAV regimen, while grade 3-4 pyneusopenia was more common in the topotecano arm (neutropenia 37.8% vs 51.4% (p < 0.001); pyneustropenia 9.8% vs 1.4% (P < 0.00); anaemia 17.7% vs 7.2% (P > 0.001). The study also evaluated the impact of therapy-related symptoms such as dyspnoea, dysphonia and polyphonia, as well as symptomatic disorders related to CAV in the mouse control regimen. Topotecan was superior to the CAV regimen in controlling symptoms such as dyspnoea, anorexia, asthenia and dysphonia. Another randomised phase III study, conducted by O'Brien et al. (458), compared topotecan (oral administration 2.3 mg/mq/day for 5 days, every 3 weeks), with supportive therapy alone (BSC) in 141 patients with progressive SCLC after line I therapy, considered not eligible for intravenous treatment. In a subsequent Phase III study, Eckardt et al. (459) compared the 2 different modes of administration of topotecane, i. e. oral vs. oral, in 309 patients with SCLC, who had achieved a complete or partial response to a line of chemotherapy I, and who subsequently developed disease at least 90 days later. In addition, oral administration was associated with a higher incidence of Grade 4 haematological toxicity (neutropenia 47% vs 64%, plastrinopenia 29% vs 18%, anaemia 23% vs 31%, sepsis 3% for both modalities). The study does not definitively answer the question of the superiority of one mode of administration over the other as the lower confidence interval does not reach statistical significance and therefore does not meet the pre-set objective of non-inferiority. amrubicin vs. topotecan in 605 patients with SCLC sensitive or refractory to platinum-based line I treatment with a 2:1 randomization. treatment with amruvicin showed no difference in survival compared to topotecon (OS: 7.5 vs. 7.8 months; HR: 0.880; 95% CI 0.733-1.057; p=0.170; PFS: 4.1 vs. 3.5 months; HD 0.802; 95% IC 0.667-0.965; p= 0.018), whereas the objective response rate was in favour of the amlubicin treatment arm (31% vs. 16.9%; OR 2.223; p < 0.001). with regard to the tolerability profile, the comparison between amrupicin and topotechan showed the following differences in terms of degree of toxicity: neutropenia (41% vs 54%; p=0,004); transplanktonic asthenia (25% vs. Limitations: Performance and detection biases Benefit/harm balance: Likely in favour of topotecan treatment Overall quality Clinical evidence strength Recommendation In patients with progressive SCLC following a first line of chemotherapy, tocanpote treatment may be considered as a first-line therapeutic option (457- in favour",

      "text": "Physical symptoms related to cancer, together with the psychological, social and spiritual discomforts associated with the progression of the disease, predominantly affect the quality of life of the patient and his or her family.In recent years, a large number of studies conducted in metastatic cancer patients have demonstrated the usefulness of systematically combining anti-cancer therapies with palliative care, obtaining not only a benefit on all quality-of-life parameters, but in some cases also a prolongation of survival (462).Among these, the study conducted in patients with advanced NSCLC, followed at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston between 2006 and 2009 (463).The aim of the study was to evaluate the addition of standard oncological care to a pre-stage care programme for patients with newly diagnosed advanced NCSC. In addition to standard oncology care, an early palliative care programme for patients newly diagnosed with advanced NSCLC was added. Patients assigned to the control arm received normal oncological care, while patients assigned in the experimental arm were additionally 'taken care of' by a palliation team until death. Of course, at the request of the patient, family members or the treating oncologist, patients in the control arms could also be visited by the palliations team. FACT-L, which has a range from 0 to 136, was in fact equal to 98 and 91.5 (p=0.03), in the two arms, respectively. Patients assigned to systematic palliative care visits also had better scores relative to the depressive state. Although the primary objective of the study was to change the quality of life, the authors also collected information related to the vital status of the patients, reporting better overall survival (11.6 months compared to 8.9 months; p=0.02) in the group of patients assigned for systematic Palliative Care visits. is concerned with the impact of the addition of systematic and early palliative care to standard care, especially in terms of quality of life. The observed results support the authors' hypothesis that the 'taking charge' by a palliation care team, throughout the natural history of advanced disease (from diagnosis to death), and not just at the failure of active anti-cancer therapies, can have a positive impact on the quality of lives and mood of patients. This work therefore fits in with the literature that in recent years aims to underline the importance of an integrated, simultaneous approach between anticancer treatments and palliatives, compared to the old model of palliational care identified with outpatient care, no longer eligible for active treatments at the end of life and near the end. Simultaneous care has also been shown to improve the correct end-of-life care setting, improve patient satisfaction with chemotherapy, and reduce the cost of living (464). For this reason, concomitant care is now considered to be the paradigm of the best care for the advanced and/or metastatic cancer patient (465). For years now, AIOM has established a Working Group dedicated to Concomitant Care and Continuity of Care in Oncology. As stated in the document produced following the first National Consensus Conference on concurrent care, held in Rome as early as September 2013 multanee_in_Oncologia.pdf] Combinant care can only be achieved through a review of current organisational and socio-assisting models, and requires close synergy between territorial services and hospital activities dedicated to patients with cancer. For specific oncological care, reference is made to the recommendations in the AIOM oncology guideline.",

RESEARCH OF THE EVIDENCE PULMONE OPLASIES AGGIUNTIVE CONSIDERATIONS ○ Large ○ Moderate ○ Small ● Trivial ○ Varies ○ Don't know A bibliographic search was performed on the Medline and Embase databases until October 2023. After removal of duplicates, 121 records were found. 48 observational studies from 11 systematic reviews and 2 RCTs were included. These were observational trials, predominantly retrospective in nature, that provided information on outcompetitive interest in patients with small cell lung neoplasia who had not initially undergone surgery, lobotomy, or surgery in the right lobe of the lung. Another RCT was also included that randomised 697 patients with NSCLC (T1aN0) to surgical treatment of segmentectomy versus lobectomy.

In addition, it is important to note that there is no evidence to suggest that the use of a segmental lobectomy in small-sized peripheral non-small-cell lung cancer (JCOG0802/JOGW4607L) is a multicentre, open-label, 3-phase, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial. In this regard, it should be recalled that the Commission's proposal for a Directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses is in line with the principle of proportionality as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).

RESEARCH OF THE EVIDENCE CON A bibliographic search was performed on the Medline and Embase databases up to July 2022. After removal of duplicates, 121 records were found. 7 records were acquired in full-text, of which 3 were excluded by study design. 4 studies were included: w The study by Gomez et al. included 49 patients with metastatic NSCLC (up to 3 lesions), randomising them to systemic and locoregional treatment versus systemic/observation treatment alone. The RT study at Imengar et al., included 29 NLC patients with oligometastatic immunotherapy, randomised them to locoregioal treatment following systemic treatment alone, compared to randomized treatment, and included 2 patients who received treatment from the RCT study (metastatic and ethotherapy), which pooled them to treatment with systemic therapy and metastasis alone. The study by Wang et al. included 133 patients with advanced oligomestatic EGFR mutation lung adenocarcinoma, randomised to treatment with TKI versus TKI and RT on metastatic lesions and primary tumour.

J Natl Cancer Inst; Jan 30 2022. Comments ◯ The addition of a locus-regional treatment to systemic therapy may not result in any difference in the rate of discontinuity from treatment, either systemic or locus. ◯ Adding a locos-region treatment to systemsic therapy could greatly reduce the likelihood of locoregional progression. In addition, it is important to note that the use of radiotherapy in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (MSCLC) is not limited to those who have undergone radiation therapy for a limited number of years, but may also be used to treat certain types of lung cancer.

      "text": "Since 2016, the recommendations formulated in the AIOM Guidelines have been produced by adapting the GRADE methodology (Methodological Manual 2015-2019) to the Italian context. With the complex and burdensome in terms of time and commitment for the methodologists and for the members of the Working Groups of each LG, only clinical diagnostic/therapeutic questions are addressed for the time being: ✓ diagnostic tests whose balance between benefits and harms is not definitively clarified; ✓ newly marketed drugs/treatments whose benefit-harm balance is not definitely clarified, ✓ medicines/historical treatments whenever new data on efficacy and/or safety have emerged. A common approach to all LG formulations is that the clinical question to which the recommendation will be made by avoiding the role of the P.I.acronym (population) in the treatment is as follows: . C=comparison; O=outcome), avoiding generic questions (e.g. what is the role of intervention XXX in the treatment of .). Hence, the question should be posed as follows: P: In patients with (mention specific patient characteristics, disease, stage, etc.) I: treatment with (describe the therapeutic intervention in question) C: is it likely to be used as an alternative to (description of the treatment otherwise considered as alternative to the intervention under consideration) The outcomes are listed and described in the supporting text of the recommendations: O: with reference to the limit of benefit and harm outcome (list the clinical-laboratory parameters measures of effect, outcomes considered essential/important for the proposed therapy) • The working group (disciplinary working group) should independently initiate the outcome research and evaluate the benefits of the proposed treatment; • The methodology is carried out by a multidisciplinary panel of experts from the same area, independently of language, literature and timeframe; • It is part of the process of the selection of the EMBTR, an exclusive, non-registered, multi-speciality and non-selective trial, based on the WHO database. • The panel identifies, independently of the Methodology Group, potentially eligible studies and assesses their inclusion. Depending on the clinical question, the types of study designs most appropriate to answer the request will be considered. Editorials, position papers, comments, letters, narrative reviews, or case reports will not be included. • The methodology group is competent to assess the quality of the evidence for a single clinical outcome, which is based on 5 dimensions (risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, publication bias), and is summarised in 4 levels (high, moderate, low, very low), produces the evidence synoptic tables and applies the Evidence to Decision Framework (EtD) tool which also takes into account the values and preferences of patients through a number of other dimensions, such as feasibility, equity, etc. • The report of the panel proceeds according to the assessment of the benefits of the intervention and is then put to the vote on the corresponding recommendation relating to the strength of participation and participation in the intervention. In cases where a majority is not obtained at the first reading, the vote shall be repeated after further discussion/comparison with or without new evidence to a satisfactory level. • In the event that evidence of any rank is missing, it will only be possible to raise the issue in a good practice statement if the following conditions are met: − the clinical assessments provided are genuinely necessary in relation to the actual healthcare situation; − the research and synthesis of the evidence do not at this time constitute an appropriate use of resources; − after considering all relevant examples and potential consequential statements of the recommendations provided, the implementation of such Good practice statements will be clearly divided into different positions, with explanation of the reason (s) wherever possible. • The number of references to follow the recommendation in the Good Practice Statement will be indicated for each recommendation as a result of the positive outcome of the intervention and the importance of the subject matter of the present recommendation. Clinical practice expresses the clinical importance of an intervention/procedure and the strength of clinical recommendation is graded on 4 levels (Table 1).Strength of Recommendation Terminology Clinic Significance No patients with (selection criteria) The intervention under consideration should be the intervention xxx should be considered as the first therapeutic option Strongly favourable considered as (evidence that the benefits prevail over the first harm treatment option) Intention None of the patients with [selection criterion] The intervention in question may be considered The intervention xxx may be taken as a first intention treatment, Conditionally harmful considered as an option aware of the existence of alternative therapies favourable to the intended benefits, equally proponent (alternative uncertainty regarding the prevalence of the harms) Complete benefits should be taken into consideration on the patients under examination Strongly in favour of the intended treatment option taken into account as (Evidence that benefits predominate over the treatment option of first harm) Intent No patients with the intervention under review can be regarded as the intervention xx may be chosen as the primary treatment option, Conditional harms are not considered as first intentionally unfavourable However, in the case of no patients with an alternative treatment intervention selected as the intended benefit Strong disadvantage considered as case considered (evidence that therapeutic options of first harm prevail over benefits) intention Table 1. Terminology and meaning of clinical recommendations. • In accordance with the recommendations of evidence-based practice (Haynes RB, BMJ 2002) by to consider is not meant an invitation to administer a treatment, but to verify the greater or lesser opportunity based on the present disease (biopathological characteristics, stage, risk of relapse or progression, etc.), the patient's condition (PS, age, comorbidity, etc.) and his/her preferences/expectations/values. The appropriateness of formulating the clinical recommendation in this 'non-categorical' way is also shared by NICE (see NICE Guideline Manual, 2012) • Regarding the possibility of considering the use of resources by threshold of sustainability (cost-benefit analysis) as an outcome (of benefit or harm), the GRADE method allows for the omission of this option when there is no evidence to support a correct cost-effectiveness analysis (comparison of the costs and outcomes of different treatment alternatives) (Guyatt GH, 2008; Brunetti M et al, 2013) Pharmacoeconomic type aspects will therefore not be taken into account (by applying the EtD therefore the cost- effectiveness dimension will not be assessed unless evidence of this kind is found in the selection phase of the studies). • Recommendations will be considered in the studies and not yet in the AIFA-authorised diagnostic drug flow charts. • For some recommendations, formulated from 2012 to 2015, the evaluation of the quality of the evidence was carried out by applying the old SIGN Scottish Intercollegate Guidelines Network (SIGN) rules (see How to read the recommendations). The transition from SIGN to GRADE methodology will be gradual over the years, and will only address those questions still open. That is, where scientific production is still active and where there has not been a breakthrough by the scientific community. As suggested by GRADE evidence, there are 5 situations in which a pragmatic approach is possible following a strong or weak formulation of certain recommendations. These are set out in Table 2. Table 2.Situations in which strong recommendations can be made in the presence of low or very low certainty of evidence Certitude in tests Situation Benefits vs harms Judgments on values and preferences Considerations on resources Type of recommendation Benefits Irrelevant harms (from Lintervention could save lives of great importance given a Low or Very Small increase in costs or use of resources Strong recommendation in favour Life-threatening Very low in dangerous situations. Adverse events not uncertain benefit but low related to benefits justifying the intervention High) prohibitive potentially life-saving high importance given Possible large increase in costs or use of strong recommendation against Low or Very High or uncertainty but possible benefit. adverse events, which are resources of unknown benefit could the intervention (or in favor of an uncertable benefit, certain harm Moderate low Substantial recognized damages, certain compared to the benefits, which indicate the need for a comparison recommendation are less uncertains compared to harmful/costly intervention) Large increases in costs (or use of harmful resources) Options potentially high cost and cost increase in benefits (or the use of benefits could be in favour of benefits that could be strong Recommendation for a clearly equivalent use of low or very high resources) Less important that could justify the need to avoid harmful harmful intervention than an alternative to the intervention, but if they have a similar or more harmful cost to prevent harmful risk management recommendation, but have a stronger or more damaging impact on the cost of the intervention than a comparability recommendation would justify a high, but less important than a comparative recommendation for the management of the same or very low cost, but more likely to justify harmful or harmful costs. Other (certainty: low) comparison, if less harmful Large increases in costs (or use of resources) Strong recommendation against Irrelevant (potentially low harmful intervention, potentially low or very important harm avoidance related to intervention potentially more l intervention (or in favor of a very low to while the benefit varies in its catastrophically low most harmful that may justify the need for comparison less High) magnitude recommend the least harmful harmful/costly comparison)",

      "text": "The recommendations produced by AIOM using elements of the GRADE method represent a qualifying point in the international panorama of LAGs provided by scientific organisations, produced to a large extent through the use of non-systematic reviews and through consensus among experts. The AIOM LAGs do not make the quality judgment on the study design alone (see NCCN Guidelines standard version) but on the risk of bias, on heterogeneity (see ESMO Guidelines) and on data transferability (extrapolation of evidence) for each outcome critical or important for the clinical proposal. In these 5 years, AIOM has started a profound process of revision - still ongoing - of the way of proposing the LAGs, which has allowed to obtain important but still achievable results. The effort of these years has in fact made it possible to obtain recommendations based on comprehensive quality reviews of the exhaustive data (see all the relevant literature) but not only from the literature, and thus leads to the evaluation of the recommended clinical methodology by means of GRADE. In addition, the working methods of the Groups have been made as homogeneous as possible so that the reader has the opportunity to move easily between recommendations within or between guidelines.

Recently SIGN (Scottish Intercollegate Guideline Network) has adopted the elements of GRADE (Grading Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation Working Group) for the assessment of evidence. An indication of this kind can only strengthen our approach to the production of clinical practice recommendations, as the integration between the two systems has always been the proposal of this methodological group. Precisely for this reason, AIOM 2016 decided to abandon the evidence assessment according to SIGN to focus on GRADE and to address all the relevant clinical questions by gradually replacing it with the instructional methodology for SIGN in the first and second parts.",

      "heading": "2.1 Formulation of the Clinical Question",
      "text": "For the precise definition of the field of application, a correct formulation of the question is essential, which tends not to be generic (what is the role of X in the treatment of the pathology Y), but adherent to the ICPO) i.e. Patients, Intervention, Comparison, and (Outcome). Outcome is put in parentheses because it is not always spendable directly in the question, often in fact the outcomes of interest are multiple and it would not be intelligible to include a list of them at the end of the query. In the GRADE method, once selected, outcomes will be classified in terms of relevance: • important and essential (indicated as critical for making a clinical decision) • important but not essential • not important. This method suggests that the relevance of the outcome be assessed by individual MPE voting, taking into account a 9-point scale and assigning the result to at least one of the three outcome categories described in Table 1 of the Recommendation, and on the basis of which the results are subsequently classified according to the criteria described in the above outcome classification table, or have been highlighted. the outcomes will or will not be considered in the summary table of evidence and subsequently in the formulation of the recommendation, according to the criteria set out in Table 1.Table 1: Classification of outcome 2.2.Selection of literature supporting clinical recommendations The research strategy The MSEs who are called upon to formulate a recommendation should have at their disposal the best information available in the scientific literature. To this end, it is necessary to carry out targeted systematic searches with the aim of identifying all available studies that have addressed the question. The development of a sensitive, reproducible research strategy that gives manageable results requires trained ad hoc figures, bibliometrists. Once the articles identified by the research strategy are obtained, the panel must select the best evidence. If there are no systematic reviews of randomised clinical trials (RCTs), the relevant randomized controlled trials will be observed by passing to the systematic review of the relevant individual studies or by following the syntheses of the studies (RSTs) in the pyramid, etc. On average, it is relatively easier to identify robust results for efficacy outcomes (overall survival, progression-free survival etc), while it is less common to find adequately sized studies and with sufficient follow-up for harm outcome, especially in the long term. A suggestion may be to look for negative outcoms in observational studies or case series or case reports, etc. which may also be available for diseases other than the one under consideration but related to treatment. The research strategy is explicitly made available (in appendix) to those interested in seeing it and limited to relaunching it in the future in the event of updates. The presence (and feasibility) of a research strategy developed specifically for a given quality outcome or an element of an international check-list is a requirement for the validity measurement (checklist) and a recommendation from the LG instruments. During the process of producing recommendations, a bibliographic search (exhaustive, sensitive and reproducible) of the sources is then carried out on different medical-scientific databases (PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL and area-specific databases). The querying of each database follows specific rules for each of them. In PubMed, for example, the keywords are first searched through the MESH dictionary and then in free search (using the OR boolean operator to increase sensitivity), making use of the different tools made available by the database including filters to limit the search (age range, study design type, subject type, etc.) (see Manual research strategies).",

      "heading": "2.3.1 The description of the studies as a whole",
      "text": "It is desirable that each study considered, essential for supporting a recommendation, be described in the text in a concise but comprehensive manner. It is advisable to start by reporting the main results (net effect in both relative and absolute terms, relative to the observed benefits and harms).1 It is suggested to continue by describing the methodology and above all the issues related to the conduct of the study, evaluating in sequence the possible biases. It should be borne in mind that any systematic error (bias) identified should be related in some way to its impact on the result, as not all biases contribute equally to making the results more or less credible/reliable. At the end of the description of the trial, only in text and for old questions (with SIGN evaluation), the evidence (1,2,3,4) will be removed, accompanied by the level of risk of bias (+/- +) and the PICO/PICO ratio if it is sufficiently close or distant from the study of interest. A recommendation may be supplemented by comments and may be divided into sub-recommendations where other salient characteristics of the patient, setting, route of administration, dose, timing, monitoring of specific side effects, etc. can be better specified, i.e. everything that can help the clinician to propose the intervention (pharmacological, surgical, etc.). One of the most important goals of the LG/recommandations is the local transfer of evidence produced around the world at a national or regional level. To be remembered when making a recommendation whose evidence has been assessed with SIGN: − if the evidence does not come from a RCT or meta-analysis with low quality risk bias (1++), or if studies with high quality epidemiological bias (1+) have been reported in the description of the study, or the evidence from the main studies with low risk bias should not be taken into account. − 2++ Important: regardless of the study design (indicated by: 1 or 2), if the quality level is negative (-) no recommendation will be made, even if it is negative (e.g. the intervention should not/should not be administered), as the (-) sign means unreliable results. In other words, the study is at high risk of bias, so the results are not reliable either in a positive or negative sense, and the overall uncertainty is that subsequent studies could give rise to the same argument or completely refute the same result. 2.3. In the SIGN approach, the quality of the evidence (individual studies/systematic reviews/meta-analyses, etc.) supporting the clinical recommendation was assessed taking into account both the design of the study (Fig. 1) and how it was conducted: the lesser or greater extent of the risk of bias associated with a study is indicated with the notations (++) (very low risk), (+) (low risk) (-), (high risk) respectively. The Essential Level of SIGN Evidence (Table 2) is given at the end of the overall study description where it is considered to be essential and relevant to support the study recommendation, and therefore only those levels of evidence that contribute to supporting or counteracting the specific intervention (SIGN) should be specified and judged for the performance of the trial. The overall quality of the SIGN evidence (Table 3) is then reported by letters (A, B, C, D) and corresponds to a summary judgment of the individual studies, together with an indication of the direct applicability of the evidence to the target population of the recommendation. Summary description of the results in relative terms (HR, RR, OR) or absolute terms (RD, NNT or gained, etc.). If available, report the length of follow-up. Each letter summarises the reliability in the entire body of assessed evidence that supports the recommended clinical trial; NOT always reflecting the clinical importance of the recommended trial and are NOT the strength of the single clinical review recommendation.1 Figures 2: Highly systematic biased levels of evidence + 1 months of risk based on SIGN results + 1 month of RCT -> Risk of bias not high. 1 ++ Very low risk of bias. 1 + Low risk of error. 1 - High risk of errors -> the results of the study are not reliable.

Probability of one outcome being published over another due to the fact that the outcome is positive (statistically significant). ✓ Precision assesses the accuracy of the estimates: − results are imprecise when the studies include few patients and/ or few events occur, thus producing confidence limits for the estimate of the large effect measure that may be compatible with clinical conclusions of the opposite sign; − in case the frequency of the event is very low, with large confidence intervals of the relative effect estimate and narrow confidence ranges of the absolute effect estimation, it is possible not to lower the level of quality of the trial. ✓ Directness evaluates the applicability of the evidence (P.I.C.O.) − population, as intervention, control or indirect outcomes: the question for which the recommendation is intended refers to a population-relevant intervention, as control, which is different from or much less effective than the outcome of the clinical findings of the contrary sign; in fact, it will be useful to assess the extent to which these studies are comparable with those of the direct intervention, but not to compare them directly with the size of the B and C studies, since they only address the same measure of effectiveness as the directed intervention. ✓ Consistency assesses the consistency of results between different studies carried out with the same objective: this criterion applies only to the set of available literature and not to the individual study; it manifests itself as a heterogeneity of effect estimates between studies that finds no logical explanation (diversity in the type of intervention or in the composition of the studied populations) and therefore increases the uncertainty about the real magnitude of the effect of the intervention (applies only in the assessment of a systematic review). ✓ Publication bias evaluates the presence of selective publication of data: tendency according to which published studies differ systematically from unpublished studies, they are more likely to report statistically significant or less negative results. ▪ Suggests the possibility of explicitly discussing and examining the presence or absence of strong bias, if appropriate, in this case.

The GRADE method suggests to proceed by considering only the essential (critical) outcomes for the formulation of the recommendation related to the clinical question. If the quality is different between the individual essential outcome, the method suggest the following line of behaviour: ✓ if the results go in opposite directions (e.g. the recommended treatment is of better quality in terms of efficacy but worse with regard to undesirable effects), the overall quality is attributed based on the worst evaluation i.e. assuming as the most representative the critical (essential for the Clinical Proposal) outcome that obtained the lowest quality evaluation; ✓ If the results are in the same direction for all the outcome (benefit or harm is assumed), the quality of the evidence of the essential end-outcome is taken as the global quality that would only be based on to formulate the Recommendation successfully.
