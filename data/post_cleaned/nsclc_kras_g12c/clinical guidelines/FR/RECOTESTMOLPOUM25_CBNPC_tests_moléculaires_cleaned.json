      "text": "The detection of molecular alterations in cancer cells has led not only to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development of the disease, but also to the development and design of therapies targeting these molecular abnormalities. The molecular characterisation of the tumour has thus become a decisive criterion in the choice of therapeutic strategy. It allows the prescription of a number of treatments to be restricted to only those patients who are likely to benefit from them, thereby reducing the number of unnecessary, toxic and costly treatments. Since then, erlohnib, afahnib, osimerhnib and dacomihnib have also received MAs for this indication. In addition, osimarhnib can now be prescribed as an adjuvant after complete tumour resection for patients with IBIA-IIIA acquired EGFR mutagenicity, after adjunctive chemotherapy when indicated. Other types of predictive biomarkers of response to targeted therapies are also being introduced into clinical practice in the CBNPC for the prescription of targeted therapy, such as fusions involving ALK1 genes and ROS1. In addition, after decades of disappointing results, promising results obtained with immune system checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of metastatic melanoma have re-established immunotherapy as a major alternative in treating cancers. In CBNPCs, research on immune control point inhibitors has resulted in AMM being obtained for some patients whose tumour carries the T790M resistance mutagen to first- and second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ITKs). In addition, therapies targeting new altered genes are expanding the scope for prescribing targeted therapeutics: • KRAS G12C mutagen allows the prescription of adagrasib as part of a Compassionate Access Authorization (ACA) (reimbursement for sotorasib has been refused); • several treatments exist for patients with muons resulting in a MET exon 14 leak (crizohnib: AAC; tepohnib:: AMM, ongoing reimbursements in France for ahona; tramadol: selmahnib: Positif opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMPH) [in the European Medicines Agency (EMA) ]; and now allows for a second combination of mutagen in the first and second stages of treatment with adragasib in the framework of the first treatment with metaphenavir (CBN) by means of the CBF VMA in April 2022); The fact that a medicine has an MA does not mean that it is available and reimbursed in France. The High Health Authority (HAS) gives an opinion on the reimbursement and then the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM) decides on the refund. In the event of a refund, the price is then negotiated with the manufacturer. This process can be lengthy. Before the MA or between the MA and the decision to refund by the CNAM, there are in some cases early access provisions, issued by the National Agency for Health Security (AANSM) and post-authorisation authorisation of medicinal products (AAPM) or pre-authorisation of compassionate care (AACM).",

      "text": "The deployment of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled the analysis of multiple molecular alterations that constitute potential therapeutic targets. In the case of analysis of solid tumours, a minimum list of 16 genes has been published by INCa2 for routine use. DNA sequencing is not always sufficient to analyse all required biomarkers, and complementary techniques are being deployed in clinical practice, such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the study of protein expression such as PD-L1 and ALK, or RNA sequencing on NGS (seq) for fusion transcripts research. Furthermore, while research of these abnormal molecules is traditionally carried out on tumour tissue, it remains fixed to the paraffin cell and is included in an alternative, more biologically liquid source, called biopsy. This term refers to the isolation of biological material released by the tumor from body fluids, most often blood, but also cerebrospinal fluid in the case of brain metastases and pleural fluid for metastatic pleurisy. The analysis of this biological matter therefore allows, with some technical limitations, less invasive access and generally with a shorter time to return results to certain molecular tumor abnormalities. This analysis can be repeated during the course of the patient's treatments. This analysis can be repeated during the course of the patient's treatments, and the strategy for carrying out molecular tests becomes more complex with: • the need to look for biomarkers of different nature for the same patient and to use several techniques in parallel; • the possibility of using multiplex techniques, allowing the search for several molecular abnormalities simultaneously; • increasing access to experimental treatments based on the presence of new targets. 2 Lists of minimum genes to be analyzed as part of a diagnostic use of the NGS (February 2016), available for download on cancer. This document presents the conclusions of the expert group on the testing strategy to be implemented in patients with CBNPC for an optimal care strategy at all stages of the disease (considering the data available at the time of writing). It is intended for all prescribers of molecular tests to guide the choice of tests to be carried out for their patients (e. g.: clinical oncologist, pulmonologist or other practitioner) and practitions who carry out these tests (anatomopathologists and biologists). Attention, the purpose of this document is to recommend the test to be performed and not the treatments to be administered. In addition, access to molecules is evolving very rapidly and requires real-time monitoring by the practitioner involved. This document also does not contain recommendations on how to perform the tests, but only the techniques to be used when there are several for the same biomarker. The tests should be performed according to good practices of anatomopathology and molecular biology. These test recommendations to be performed are to be discussed in a multidisciplinary consultation meeting (MPC) and/or molecular staff, depending on the local organization, including possible access to clinical trials. Performing tests to allow for the inclusion of patients in clinical studies is mentioned. Unless otherwise, these testing recommendations relate to patients with CBNPComas, apart from skin carcinomas of smokers.",

In order to initiate treatment within a reasonable timeframe, given the aggressiveness of some metastasized CBNPCs, the search for these biomarkers must be done rapidly. The recommended ideal timefrome from the diagnosis of homeopathology is 7 calendar days, with a maximum of 14 days. In case of emergency, the identification of major addictive mutations (L858R mutation and exon 19 deletion) should be able to be performed in a very rapid circuit. Furthermore, as the amount of available tumor tissue may be limited, economical management of the tumor tissues should be preferred to perform all required immunohistochemical and molecular biology examinations. There are targeted rapid molecular biology tests for only a limited number of alterations, but in the event of a negative result, they should be supplemented by an NGS to identify any unwanted abnormalities. A two-stage strategy (rapid test and then NGS) entails the risk of extending the overall time to return the result and consuming more tumour material. Taking these arguments into account, it is recommended, if the local organisation allows for a timely result, to search for alterations of EGFR, ALK, RETOS1 directly by NGS.

The NGS panels used must be capable of searching for at least: • mutations in the following genes: o EGFR: search for alterations in exons 18 to 21 (including insertions of exon 20), o KRAS: look for mutations on exon 2 (especially the G12C mutation), o BRAF: search of a V600 mutation of Braf, o HER2/ERRB2: look for Mutations on Exon 20, o MET: search For alterations resulting in a jump from exon 14 • fusions involving the following gene; search for ALK, RTR1, ROS, NETK1/2 • MET amplification. The result of these panels may not exceed 3 weeks in any one or two consecutive calendar periods. Research can be done in one or two panels either in parallel or sequentially. In case of progression: • After targeted therapy: In the event of disease progression, it is recommended to look for molecular resistance mechanisms (NGS DNA and/or RNA). These tests should be performed on a sample of a lesion in progression. In cases where a biopsy is not possible, research can be performed using liquid biopsy. The search for other emerging molecular alterations by large gene panels or sequencing within the framework of the France Médecine Génomique plan can be discussed in RCP and/ or molecular staff, depending on the local/national organization. • From the second line of treatment: For non-advanced/mastastatic CBNPCs in the absence of mutation, it must be looked for by IFR-MET examplification and if this has not been done, then by MET-MHC.",
