Given the aggressive nature of this disease and the poor prognosis if not diagnosed at an early stage, it is very important to define and implement a standardized approach in the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of these patients. Treatment methods include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted biological therapy and immunotherapy depending on the stage of the disease, the biological characteristics of the tumor and the general condition of the patient. Due to the aggressiveness of the disease and bad prognosis if it is not diagnosed early, it is important to define and implement a standardized approach for diagnostics, treatment and monitoring of these patients. Treatment modalities include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy , targeted biologic therapy and immunotherapy according to the stage, specific tumour histological subtype and patient condition.

If the patient ra) pathohistological finding of the biopsy should include: histological stages of disease I, II declared inoperable because it cannot be sub-type, EGFR status (for non-smokers, for non-squamous when no surgical intervention and resection of the lung, consideration is given to radiation for nonsmokers and/or young patients and mixed calcium radiotherapy of the tumour (tumour dose (TD) up to 74 Gy/2 tumour), ALK status (often used, for Gy fractionated when no treatment, or for basic stage I stereotaxic radiotherapeutic), not for non smokers and / or young patients, and for mixed or radiation therapy U.6 with stage II pleural pain). In elderly patients and those with significantly younger patients and mixed tumours, ALK status (sequential chemotenescence can be used for comorbidities, for mixed non-rapy tumours followed by radiotherapy.17 Neoadvanced chemoradio- and/ or young smokers and mixture tumour therapy is indicated in patients with Pancoccal tumour (T3N0 1). In patients with stage IIIB disease, the best results are achieved by the use of concomitant diagnostic procedures: anamoradiotherapy.1316 Post-operative radiofrequency and non-physical screening, KCS, DKS, SE, coagulation test therapy is not indicated: multiple, complete biochemistry, plethysmography (PA and CT scan), radical biopsy of the thoracic and abdominal cavities, cytoplasmic surgery in patients with lung cancer (R1, R2, R3, R4, and R2); in patients who have undergone additional chemotherapy (N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, N6, N7, N8, N9, N10), or radiation therapy with bronchopneumonia (in patients with previously undergone surgery) with a chest biopsy (R10, N1, N2), or bronchoscopy with lymphatic tissue (R21, N2); and in patients undergoing radiotherapy with concomitant lymph nodes (R2, N1, and N2). Diagnostic procedures to assess disease progression: in non-radically (R1, R2) operated patients with N2: thoracic and upper abdominal CT, PET (only in potentially concomitant chemoradiotherapy (60 70 but operable patients), scintigraphy if bone is present Gy/1,8 2 Gy per fraction).21 or symptoms of suspected metastases (metastasis), renal After surgical treatment, adjunctive bone should be performed if pathological symptoms are present or chemotherapy with ventricular cytokines is indicated in patients with severe stage IA, patients with stage IIB or stage IIA brain lesions, and patients with stages IIB and IIA MRIs if symptoms and effectiveness of the therapy are contraindicated.22 In patients with stage IA there are no symptoms of brain tumors, and in stage II disease there is no evidence of the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy.In addition, puncture and cytological analysis of the pleural effusion, in stage IB disease adjuvent chemotherapeutic administration or biopsy of enlarged lymph nodes and additional pre-treatment is recommended in those with tumours larger than 4 cm.25 For adjuvants, endobronchial ultrasound, transeesophageal ultrasonography, and chemo-therapy based on flame-stenoscopy are recommended. Diagnostic procedures to evaluate the function of the respiratory system and the possibility of pulmonary resection: spirometry, systemic therapy in patients analysis of gases in arterial blood and acid-base status, determination of metastatic lung cancer (stage IV) outside of the lung diffusion capacity for CO, ECG, ultrasound First-line treatment of the heart and additional examination; lung scintigraphy (ventilation and perfusion), stress tests (spiroergometry), determination first-line therapy of patients based on external pressures in the pulmonar artery. The first line of treatment includes the third generation of cytotoxic drugs: gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetrexed, vinorelbine, and etoposide is also considered.30,31 Po-activation mutations data from clinical studies indicate the importance of histological (ci-activated EGFR mutations (exon deletion 19, mutational) under non-lung cell carcinomas on exon and exon 21-L858R, L861; exon exon 18-G197X; G719; lung cancer when exon 2068I mutations are optimal) predictive responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors during treatment. In patients with an activation mutation, it is recommended that patients with non-EGFR non-malignant lung cancer receive: erlotinib, gefi tinib or afatinib in the first line of treatment.4348 In select patients, pemetrexed + platinum.32,33 In patients considering addition of bevacizumab after 4 treatment cycles, disease progression should not be considered when considering therapy with erlotib.49 If the mutation status is unknown, or if there is no evidence of a mutation in the treatment regimen, chemotherapy is recommended until progression of the disease.34 5052 In platinum and gemcitabine-cisplatin, bevacizumab should be added.3537 Patients with ALK-translocation are recommended to be treated on the basis of disease progression. In patients with creatinine-free plasma.5543, in patients with PS3 or PS4 is recommended to use subcutaneous plasma. In patients with squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer or after the first line of treatment, and their general condition is satisfactory, a second line of therapy is recommended. In this line of treatments, gemcitabine + platinum,33 which is usually prescribed as monotherapy, is most commonly docetaxel chemotherapy protocols based on platinum (packels or pemexed (for type III).5557 Depending on the preference of tacell-vinyl, docorbinel, tacell). In patients with platinum laziness, a combination of two drugs with adenocarcinoma in which rapid progression has occurred or without platinum is recommended. In PS 2 patients, monochemo is recommended - this is a refractory disease; doceterapy is advised.38 If a decision is made to carry out treatment with taksela and nintedanib.59 with the combination of the two drugs, it is necessary to perform reinforcement - Radiological control is required after every 2 cycles considered supportive treatment. Second-line therapy (X-ray/ CT scan):40 patients with activation mutations if there is a response to chemotherapy after 2 cycles In patients with an EGFR mutation, it is recommended to administer erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib if no prior re-application of the mutation occurs; in patients with thyroid cancer, a biopsy or a blood sample is taken after 4 cycles of therapy to determine whether the disease is progressing well. In patients who drink, 2 more cycles of the same chemotherapy may be administered; in those who demonstrate a resistant mutation T790M is recommended if after 4 cycles the radiological finding is that therapy other than erythromycin is being used.64 In patients with ALK-translocation leading to stable disease (SD), chemotherapeutic therapy may be preferred over the advise to administer crizotinib if not previously given, and the patient may be ordered to undergo all-day radiological control. In patients with ALK-translocation who have been treated for 6 to 8 weeks; when progression is established, treatment with crizotinib should be recommended, followed by treatment with ceritinib or alectriptyline; if after 2 cycles radiological treatment shows stable disease (SD), chemotherapy may be continued for a further 2nd 3rd line of treatment; if disease progression occurs during or after the 2nd cycle; if SD is not detected until after 4 cycles and the chemo needs treatment, a third line of therapy may be administered. In patients with ALK-translocation, it may be administered if after the 2nd or 4th cycle of chemotherapy, it is established that erlotinib, gefi tinib, or afatinib has not been previously given. In patients with adenocarcinoma, first-line therapy is not recommended for more than six patients with lung cancer and unknown EGFR status (after a course of chemotherapy except when maintaining steady-state pathohistologic/ cytologic material until EGFR progression testing can be performed) taking into account the use of erlotinib.4421,67 in patients with progressive disease (PD) and switching to a second line of treatment following ALK-translocation.
